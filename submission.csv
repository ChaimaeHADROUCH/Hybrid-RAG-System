1.4 Careers in Psychology
Clive Wearing is an accomplished musician who lost his ability to form new memories when
he became sick at the age of 46. While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember
what he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is
associated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend’s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John
Nash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would
tell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended
for him. He also began to hear voices and became suspicious of the people around him. Soon thereafter, Nash
was diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a state-run mental institution (O’Connor & Robertson,
1Introduction to Psychology
2002). Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these
experiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain’s internal
processes and people’s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of
psychology has explored these questions.
1.1 What Is Psychology?
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Define psychology
• Understand the merits of an education in psychology
What is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology
explores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists
use the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question
about how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the
phenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or
group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over
time. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes
observations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then
published or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.
Scientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because
it is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We
must ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However,
we can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus,
psychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.
In general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot
arrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the
mind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific
method is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on
observation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or
previous authorities.
It was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this
time, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is,
at its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological
organism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore,
psychology is also a social science.
WHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?
Often, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to
learn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course
because it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as
nursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare
psychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses
across the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology
majors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook’s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality
and political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About
6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S.
Department of Education, 2016).

An education in psychology is valuable for a number of reasons. Psychology students hone critical thinking
skills and are trained in the use of the scientific method. Critical thinking is the active application of a set of
skills to information for the understanding and evaluation of that information. The evaluation of
information—assessing its reliability and usefulness— is an important skill in a world full of competing “facts,”
many of which are designed to be misleading. For example, critical thinking involves maintaining an attitude
of skepticism, recognizing internal biases, making use of logical thinking, asking appropriate questions, and
making observations. Psychology students also can develop better communication skills during the course of
their undergraduate coursework (American Psychological Association, 2011). Together, these factors increase
students’ scientific literacy and prepare students to critically evaluate the various sources of information they
encounter.
In addition to these broad-based skills, psychology students come to understand the complex factors that
shape one’s behavior. They appreciate the interaction of our biology, our environment, and our experiences in
determining who we are and how we will behave. They learn about basic principles that guide how we think
and behave, and they come to recognize the tremendous diversity that exists across individuals and across
cultural boundaries (American Psychological Association, 2011).

1.2 History of Psychology
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Understand the importance of Wundt and James in the development of psychology
• Appreciate Freud’s influence on psychology
• Understand the basic tenets of Gestalt psychology
• Appreciate the important role that behaviorism played in psychology’s history
• Understand basic tenets of humanism
• Understand how the cognitive revolution shifted psychology’s focus back to the mind
Psychology is a relatively young science with its experimental roots in the 19th century, compared, for
example, to human physiology, which dates much earlier. As mentioned, anyone interested in exploring issues
related to the mind generally did so in a philosophical context prior to the 19th century. Two 19th century
scholars, Wilhelm Wundt and William James, are generally credited as being the founders of psychology as a
science and academic discipline that was distinct from philosophy. This section will provide an overview of the
shifts in paradigms that have influenced psychology from Wundt and James through today.
Wundt and Structuralism
Wilhelm Wundt (1832–1920) was a German scientist who was the first person to be referred to as a
psychologist. His famous book entitled Principles of Physiological Psychology was published in 1873. Wundt
viewed psychology as a scientific study of conscious experience, and he believed that the goal of psychology
was to identify components of consciousness and how those components combined to result in our conscious
experience. Wundt used introspection (he called it “internal perception”), a process by which someone
examines their own conscious experience as objectively as possible, making the human mind like any other
aspect of nature that a scientist observed. He believed in the notion of voluntarism—that people have free will
and should know the intentions of a psychological experiment if they were participating (Danziger, 1980).
Wundt considered his version experimental introspection; he used instruments such as those that measured
reaction time. He also wrote Volkerpsychologie in 1904 in which he suggested that psychology should include
the study of culture, as it involves the study of people. Edward Titchener, one of his students, went on to
1.2 • History of Psychology 9
develop structuralism. Its focus was on the contents of mental processes rather than their function (Pickren &
Rutherford, 2010). Wundt established his psychology laboratory at the University at Leipzig in 1879 (Figure
1.2). In this laboratory, Wundt and his students conducted experiments on, for example, reaction times. A
subject, sometimes in a room isolated from the scientist, would receive a stimulus such as a light, image, or
sound. The subject’s reaction to the stimulus would be to push a button, and an apparatus would record the
time to reaction. Wundt could measure reaction time to one-thousandth of a second (Nicolas & Ferrand, 1999).
FIGURE 1.2 (a) Wilhelm Wundt is credited as one of the founders of psychology. He created the first laboratory for
psychological research. (b) This photo shows him seated and surrounded by fellow researchers and equipment in
his laboratory in Germany.
However, despite his efforts to train individuals in the process of introspection, this process remained highly
subjective, and there was very little agreement between individuals.
Functionalism
William James, John Dewey, and Charles Sanders Peirce helped establish functional psychology (Figure 1.3).
They accepted Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection and viewed this theory as an explanation of an
organism’s characteristics. Key to that theory is the idea that natural selection leads to organisms that are
adapted to their environment, including their behavior. Adaptation means that a trait of an organism has a
function for the survival and reproduction of the individual, because it has been naturally selected. As James
saw it, psychology’s purpose was to study the function of behavior in the world, and as such, his perspective
was known as functionalism. Functionalism focused on how mental activities helped an organism fit into its
environment. Functionalism has a second, more subtle meaning in that functionalists were more interested in
the operation of the whole mind rather than of its individual parts, which were the focus of structuralism. Like
Wundt, James believed that introspection could serve as one means by which someone might study mental
activities, but James also relied on more objective measures, including the use of various recording devices,
and examinations of concrete products of mental activities and of anatomy and physiology (Gordon, 1995).

4-year institutions and use these opportunities to gain experience in teaching. Furthermore, many 2-year
colleges and schools need faculty to teach their courses in psychology. In general, many of the people who
pursue careers at these institutions have master’s degrees in psychology, although some PhDs make careers at
these institutions as well.
Some people earning PhDs may enjoy research in an academic setting. However, they may not be interested in
teaching. These individuals might take on faculty positions that are exclusively devoted to conducting
research. This type of position would be more likely an option at large, research-focused universities.
In some areas in psychology, it is common for individuals who have recently earned their PhD to seek out
positions in postdoctoral training programs that are available before going on to serve as faculty. In most
cases, young scientists will complete one or two postdoctoral programs before applying for a full-time faculty
position. Postdoctoral training programs allow young scientists to further develop their research programs
and broaden their research skills under the supervision of other professionals in the field.
Career Options Outside of Academic Settings
Individuals who wish to become practicing clinical psychologists have another option for earning a doctoral
degree, which is known as a PsyD. A PsyD is a doctor of psychology degree that is increasingly popular among
individuals interested in pursuing careers in clinical psychology. PsyD programs generally place less emphasis
on research-oriented skills and focus more on application of psychological principles in the clinical context
(Norcross & Castle, 2002).
Regardless of whether earning a PhD or PsyD, in most states, an individual wishing to practice as a licensed
clinical or counseling psychologist may complete postdoctoral work under the supervision of a licensed
psychologist. Within the last few years, however, several states have begun to remove this requirement, which
would allow people to get an earlier start in their careers (Munsey, 2009). After an individual has met the state
requirements, their credentials are evaluated to determine whether they can sit for the licensure exam. Only
individuals that pass this exam can call themselves licensed clinical or counseling psychologists (Norcross,
n.d.). Licensed clinical or counseling psychologists can then work in a number of settings, ranging from private
clinical practice to hospital settings. It should be noted that clinical psychologists and psychiatrists do different
things and receive different types of education. While both can conduct therapy and counseling, clinical
psychologists have a PhD or a PsyD, whereas psychiatrists have a doctor of medicine degree (MD). As such,
licensed clinical psychologists can administer and interpret psychological tests, while psychiatrists can
prescribe medications.
Individuals earning a PhD can work in a variety of settings, depending on their areas of specialization. For
example, someone trained as a biopsychologist might work in a pharmaceutical company to help test the
efficacy of a new drug. Someone with a clinical background might become a forensic psychologist and work
within the legal system to make recommendations during criminal trials and parole hearings, or serve as an
expert in a court case.
While earning a doctoral degree in psychology is a lengthy process, usually taking between 5–6 years of
graduate study (DeAngelis, 2010), there are a number of careers that can be attained with a master’s degree in
psychology. People who wish to provide psychotherapy can become licensed to serve as various types of
professional counselors (Hoffman, 2012). Relevant master’s degrees are also sufficient for individuals seeking
careers as school psychologists (National Association of School Psychologists, n.d.), in some capacities related
to sport psychology (American Psychological Association, 2014), or as consultants in various industrial
settings (Landers, 2011, June 14). Undergraduate coursework in psychology may be applicable to other careers
such as psychiatric social work or psychiatric nursing, where assessments and therapy may be a part of the
job.
As mentioned in the opening section of this chapter, an undergraduate education in psychology is associated
with a knowledge base and skill set that many employers find quite attractive. It should come as no surprise,

then, that individuals earning bachelor’s degrees in psychology find themselves in a number of different
careers, as shown in Table 1.1. Examples of a few such careers can involve serving as case managers, working
in sales, working in human resource departments, and teaching in high schools. The rapidly growing realm of
healthcare professions is another field in which an education in psychology is helpful and sometimes required.
For example, the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) exam that people must take to be admitted to medical
school now includes a section on the psychological foundations of behavior.

Summary
1.1 What Is Psychology?
Psychology is defined as the scientific study of mind and behavior. Students of psychology develop critical
thinking skills, become familiar with the scientific method, and recognize the complexity of behavior.
1.2 History of Psychology
Before the time of Wundt and James, questions about the mind were considered by philosophers. However,
both Wundt and James helped create psychology as a distinct scientific discipline. Wundt was a structuralist,
which meant he believed that our cognitive experience was best understood by breaking that experience into
its component parts. He thought this was best accomplished by introspection.

William James was the first American psychologist, and he was a proponent of functionalism. This particular
perspective focused on how mental activities served as adaptive responses to an organism’s environment. Like
Wundt, James also relied on introspection; however, his research approach also incorporated more objective
measures as well.
Sigmund Freud believed that understanding the unconscious mind was absolutely critical to understand
conscious behavior. This was especially true for individuals that he saw who suffered from various hysterias
and neuroses. Freud relied on dream analysis, slips of the tongue, and free association as means to access the
unconscious. Psychoanalytic theory remained a dominant force in clinical psychology for several decades.
Gestalt psychology was very influential in Europe. Gestalt psychology takes a holistic view of an individual and
his experiences. As the Nazis came to power in Germany, Wertheimer, Koffka, and Köhler immigrated to the
United States. Although they left their laboratories and their research behind, they did introduce America to
Gestalt ideas. Some of the principles of Gestalt psychology are still very influential in the study of sensation
and perception.
One of the most influential schools of thought within psychology’s history was behaviorism. Behaviorism
focused on making psychology an objective science by studying overt behavior and deemphasizing the
importance of unobservable mental processes. John Watson is often considered the father of behaviorism, and
B. F. Skinner’s contributions to our understanding of principles of operant conditioning cannot be
underestimated.
As behaviorism and psychoanalytic theory took hold of so many aspects of psychology, some began to become
dissatisfied with psychology’s picture of human nature. Thus, a humanistic movement within psychology
began to take hold. Humanism focuses on the potential of all people for good. Both Maslow and Rogers were
influential in shaping humanistic psychology.
During the 1950s, the landscape of psychology began to change. A science of behavior began to shift back to its
roots of focus on mental processes. The emergence of neuroscience and computer science aided this
transition. Ultimately, the cognitive revolution took hold, and people came to realize that cognition was crucial
to a true appreciation and understanding of behavior.
1.3 Contemporary Psychology
Psychology is a diverse discipline that is made up of several major subdivisions with unique perspectives.
Biological psychology involves the study of the biological bases of behavior. Sensation and perception refer to
the area of psychology that is focused on how information from our sensory modalities is received, and how
this information is transformed into our perceptual experiences of the world around us. Cognitive psychology
is concerned with the relationship that exists between thought and behavior, and developmental psychologists
study the physical and cognitive changes that occur throughout one’s lifespan. Personality psychology focuses
on individuals’ unique patterns of behavior, thought, and emotion. Industrial and organizational psychology,
health psychology, sport and exercise psychology, forensic psychology, and clinical psychology are all
considered applied areas of psychology. Industrial and organizational psychologists apply psychological
concepts to I-O settings. Health psychologists look for ways to help people live healthier lives, and clinical
psychology involves the diagnosis and treatment of psychological disorders and other problematic behavioral
patterns. Sport and exercise psychologists study the interactions between thoughts, emotions, and physical
performance in sports, exercise, and other activities. Forensic psychologists carry out activities related to
psychology in association with the justice system.
1.4 Careers in Psychology
Generally, academic careers in psychology require doctoral degrees. However, there are a number of
nonacademic career options for people who have master’s degrees in psychology. While people with bachelor’s
degrees in psychology have more limited psychology-related career options, the skills acquired as a function of

Finally, we will discuss some careers in psychology and the role that psychology plays in our lives. 2. WHAT IS PSYCHOLOGY? The word “psychology” comes from two Greek words, “psyche” and “logos,” which mean “mind” or “thinking.” Psychologists are interested in how the mind works and how we think and feel. They study the mental processes that occur in the brain, such as perception, attention, memory, thinking, problem solving, emotion, motivation, learning, decision making, self-regulation, personality, social behavior, etc. Psychologists use a variety of methods to study these processes, including observation, experiments, surveys, interviews, questionnaires, brain imaging, neuropsychology, cognitive neuroscience, psychometrics, clinical psychology, developmental psychology, ethnopsychology and social psychology. Psychology has a long and rich history. It has been practiced for thousands of years in many different cultures and societies. For example, in ancient Greece, Plato and Aristotle studied psychology in order to understand the nature of human beings and their relationships with each other and with their environment. In the Middle Ages, Christian theologians and philosophers used psychology as a tool for understanding the nature of God and his relationship with his creatures. During the Renaissance, scientists and thinkers such as Galileo Galilei, Isaac Newton, René Descartes, John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Auguste Comte, Jean-Paul Sartre, Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, William James, Edward Thorndike, B.F. Skinner and others developed theories of psychology that continue to shape our understanding of this field today. Today, psychology is a broad and diverse field that encompasses a wide range of subfields and disciplines. Some of these disciplines include: • Clinical psychology: This field focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders, as well as","{""sections"": [""Introduction to Psychology/Contemporary Psychology"", ""Psychological Research/Approaches to Research""], ""pages"": [""20"", ""42"", ""44""]}"
2,"FIGURE 3.6 In this Punnett square, N represents the normal allele, and p represents the recessive allele that is
associated with PKU. If two individuals mate who are both heterozygous for the allele associated with PKU, their
offspring have a 25% chance of expressing the PKU phenotype.
Where do harmful genes that contribute to diseases like PKU come from? Gene mutations provide one source
of harmful genes. A mutation is a sudden, permanent change in a gene. While many mutations can be harmful
or lethal, once in a while, a mutation benefits an individual by giving that person an advantage over those who
do not have the mutation. Recall that the theory of evolution asserts that individuals best adapted to their
particular environments are more likely to reproduce and pass on their genes to future generations. In order
for this process to occur, there must be competition—more technically, there must be variability in genes (and
resultant traits) that allow for variation in adaptability to the environment. If a population consisted of
identical individuals, then any dramatic changes in the environment would affect everyone in the same way,
and there would be no variation in selection. In contrast, diversity in genes and associated traits allows some
individuals to perform slightly better than others when faced with environmental change. This creates a
distinct advantage for individuals best suited for their environments in terms of successful reproduction and
genetic transmission.
Human Diversity
This chapter focuses on biology. Later in this course you will learn about social psychology and issues of race,
prejudice, and discrimination. When we focus strictly on biology, race becomes a weak construct. After the
sequencing of the human genome at the turn of the millennium, many scientists began to argue that race was not
a useful variable in genetic research and that its continued use represents a potential source of confusion and
harm. The racial categories that some believed to be helpful in studying genetic diversity in humans are largely
irrelevant. A person's skin tone, eye color, and hair texture are functions of their genetic makeups, but there is
actually more genetic variation within a given racial category than there is between racial categories. In some
cases, focus on race has led to difficulties with misdiagnoses and/or under-diagnoses of diseases ranging from
sickle cell anemia to cystic fibrosis. Some argue that we need to distinguish between ancestry and race and then
focus on ancestry. This approach would facilitate greater understanding of human genetic diversity (Yudell,
Roberts, DeSalle, & Tishkoff, 2016).

Gene-Environment Interactions
Genes do not exist in a vacuum. Although we are all biological organisms, we also exist in an environment that
is incredibly important in determining not only when and how our genes express themselves, but also in what
combination. Each of us represents a unique interaction between our genetic makeup and our environment;
range of reaction is one way to describe this interaction. Range of reaction asserts that our genes set the
boundaries within which we can operate, and our environment interacts with the genes to determine where in
that range we will fall. For example, if an individual’s genetic makeup predisposes them to high levels of
intellectual potential and they are reared in a rich, stimulating environment, then they will be more likely to
achieve full potential than if they were raised under conditions of significant deprivation. According to the
concept of range of reaction, genes set definite limits on potential, and environment determines how much of
that potential is achieved. Some disagree with this theory and argue that genes do not set a limit on a person’s
potential with reaction norms being determined by the environment. For example, when individuals
experience neglect or abuse early in life, they are more likely to exhibit adverse psychological and/or physical
conditions that can last throughout their lives. These conditions may develop as a function of the negative
environmental experiences in individuals from dissimilar genetic backgrounds (Miguel, Pereira, Silveira, &
Meaney, 2019; Short & Baram, 2019).
Another perspective on the interaction between genes and the environment is the concept of genetic
environmental correlation. Stated simply, our genes influence our environment, and our environment
influences the expression of our genes (Figure 3.7). Not only do our genes and environment interact, as in
range of reaction, but they also influence one another bidirectionally. For example, the child of an NBA player
would probably be exposed to basketball from an early age. Such exposure might allow the child to realize
their full genetic, athletic potential. Thus, the parents’ genes, which the child shares, influence the child’s
environment, and that environment, in turn, is well suited to support the child’s genetic potential.
FIGURE 3.7 Nature and nurture work together like complex pieces of a human puzzle. The interaction of our
environment and genes makes us the individuals we are. (credit ""puzzle"": modification of work by Cory Zanker)
In another approach to gene-environment interactions, the field of epigenetics looks beyond the genotype
itself and studies how the same genotype can be expressed in different ways. In other words, researchers study
how the same genotype can lead to very different phenotypes. As mentioned earlier, gene expression is often
influenced by environmental context in ways that are not entirely obvious. For instance, identical twins share
the same genetic information (identical twins develop from a single fertilized egg that split, so the genetic
material is exactly the same in each; in contrast, fraternal twins usually result from two different eggs
fertilized by different sperm, so the genetic material varies as with non-twin siblings). But even with identical
genes, there remains an incredible amount of variability in how gene expression can unfold over the course of
each twin’s life. Sometimes, one twin will develop a disease and the other will not. In one example, Aliya, an
identical twin, died from cancer at age 7, but her twin, now 19 years old, has never had cancer. Although these
individuals share an identical genotype, their phenotypes differ as a result of how that genetic information is

expressed over time and through their unique environmental interactions. The epigenetic perspective is very
different from range of reaction, because here the genotype is not fixed and limited.

Genes affect more than our physical characteristics. Indeed, scientists have found genetic linkages to a
number of behavioral characteristics, ranging from basic personality traits to sexual orientation to spirituality
(for examples, see Mustanski et al., 2005; Comings, Gonzales, Saucier, Johnson, & MacMurray, 2000). Genes are
also associated with temperament and a number of psychological disorders, such as depression and
schizophrenia. So while it is true that genes provide the biological blueprints for our cells, tissues, organs, and
body, they also have a significant impact on our experiences and our behaviors.
Let’s look at the following findings regarding schizophrenia in light of our three views of gene-environment
interactions. Which view do you think best explains this evidence?
In a 2004 study by Tienari and colleagues, adoptees whose biological mothers had schizophrenia and who had
been raised in a disturbed family environment were much more likely to develop schizophrenia or another
psychotic disorder than were any of the other groups in the study:
• Of adoptees whose biological mothers had schizophrenia (high genetic risk) and who were raised in
disturbed family environments, 36.8% were likely to develop schizophrenia.
• Of adoptees whose biological mothers had schizophrenia (high genetic risk) and who were raised in
healthy family environments, 5.8% were likely to develop schizophrenia.
• Of adoptees with a low genetic risk (whose mothers did not have schizophrenia) and who were raised in
disturbed family environments, 5.3% were likely to develop schizophrenia.
• Of adoptees with a low genetic risk (whose mothers did not have schizophrenia) and who were raised in
healthy family environments, 4.8% were likely to develop schizophrenia.
The study shows that adoptees with high genetic risk were most likely to develop schizophrenia if they were
raised in disturbed home environments. This research lends credibility to the notion that both genetic
vulnerability and environmental stress are necessary for schizophrenia to develop, and that genes alone do not
tell the full tale.
3.2 Cells of the Nervous System
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Identify the basic parts of a neuron
• Describe how neurons communicate with each other
• Explain how drugs act as agonists or antagonists for a given neurotransmitter system
Psychologists striving to understand the human mind may study the nervous system. Learning how the body's
cells and organs function can help us understand the biological basis of human psychology. The nervous
system is composed of two basic cell types: glial cells (also known as glia) and neurons. Glial cells are
traditionally thought to play a supportive role to neurons, both physically and metabolically. Glial cells provide
scaffolding on which the nervous system is built, help neurons line up closely with each other to allow
neuronal communication, provide insulation to neurons, transport nutrients and waste products, and mediate
immune responses. For years, researchers believed that there were many more glial cells than neurons;
however, more recent work from Suzanna Herculano-Houzel's laboratory has called this long-standing
assumption into question and has provided important evidence that there may be a nearly 1:1 ratio of glia cells
to neurons. This is important because it suggests that human brains are more similar to other primate brains
than previously thought (Azevedo et al, 2009; Herculano-Houzel, 2012; Herculano-Houzel, 2009). Neurons, on
78 3 • Biopsychology
Access for free at openstax.org
the other hand, serve as interconnected information processors that are essential for all of the tasks of the
nervous system. This section briefly describes the structure and function of neurons.
Neuron Structure
Neurons are the central building blocks of the nervous system, 100 billion strong at birth. Like all cells,
neurons consist of several different parts, each serving a specialized function (Figure 3.8). A neuron’s outer
surface is made up of a semipermeable membrane. This membrane allows smaller molecules and molecules
without an electrical charge to pass through it, while stopping larger or highly charged molecules.
FIGURE 3.8 This illustration shows a prototypical neuron, which is being myelinated by a glial cell.
The nucleus of the neuron is located in the soma, or cell body. The soma has branching extensions known as
dendrites. The neuron is a small information processor, and dendrites serve as input sites where signals are
received from other neurons. These signals are transmitted electrically across the soma and down a major
extension from the soma known as the axon, which ends at multiple terminal buttons. The terminal buttons
contain synaptic vesicles that house neurotransmitters, the chemical messengers of the nervous system.
Axons range in length from a fraction of an inch to several feet. In some axons, glial cells form a fatty substance
known as the myelin sheath, which coats the axon and acts as an insulator, increasing the speed at which the
signal travels. The myelin sheath is not continuous and there are small gaps that occur down the length of the
axon. These gaps in the myelin sheath are known as the Nodes of Ranvier. The myelin sheath is crucial for the
normal operation of the neurons within the nervous system: the loss of the insulation it provides can be
detrimental to normal function. To understand how this works, let’s consider an example. PKU, a genetic
disorder discussed earlier, causes a reduction in myelin and abnormalities in white matter cortical and
subcortical structures. The disorder is associated with a variety of issues including severe cognitive deficits,
exaggerated reflexes, and seizures (Anderson & Leuzzi, 2010; Huttenlocher, 2000). Another disorder, multiple
sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disorder, involves a large-scale loss of the myelin sheath on axons throughout
the nervous system. The resulting interference in the electrical signal prevents the quick transmittal of
information by neurons and can lead to a number of symptoms, such as dizziness, fatigue, loss of motor
control, and sexual dysfunction. While some treatments may help to modify the course of the disease and
manage certain symptoms, there is currently no known cure for multiple sclerosis.
In healthy individuals, the neuronal signal moves rapidly down the axon to the terminal buttons, where
synaptic vesicles release neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft (Figure 3.9). The synaptic cleft is a very
small space between two neurons and is an important site where communication between neurons occurs.
Once neurotransmitters are released into the synaptic cleft, they travel across it and bind with corresponding
receptors on the dendrite of an adjacent neuron. Receptors, proteins on the cell surface where
neurotransmitters attach, vary in shape, with different shapes “matching” different neurotransmitters.
How does a neurotransmitter “know” which receptor to bind to? The neurotransmitter and the receptor have
3.2 • Cells of the Nervous System 79
what is referred to as a lock-and-key relationship—specific neurotransmitters fit specific receptors similar to
how a key fits a lock. The neurotransmitter binds to any receptor that it fits.
FIGURE 3.9 (a) The synaptic cleft is the space between the terminal button of one neuron and the dendrite of
another neuron. (b) In this pseudo-colored image from a scanning electron microscope, a terminal button (green)
has been opened to reveal the synaptic vesicles (orange and blue) inside. Each vesicle contains about 10,000
neurotransmitter molecules. (credit b: modification of work by Tina Carvalho, NIH-NIGMS; scale-bar data from Matt
Russell)
Neuronal Communication
Now that we have learned about the basic structures of the neuron and the role that these structures play in
neuronal communication, let’s take a closer look at the signal itself—how it moves through the neuron and then
jumps to the next neuron, where the process is repeated.
We begin at the neuronal membrane. The neuron exists in a fluid environment—it is surrounded by
extracellular fluid and contains intracellular fluid (i.e., cytoplasm). The neuronal membrane keeps these two
fluids separate—a critical role because the electrical signal that passes through the neuron depends on the
intra- and extracellular fluids being electrically different. This difference in charge across the membrane,
called the membrane potential, provides energy for the signal.
The electrical charge of the fluids is caused by charged molecules (ions) dissolved in the fluid. The
semipermeable nature of the neuronal membrane somewhat restricts the movement of these charged
molecules, and, as a result, some of the charged particles tend to become more concentrated either inside or
outside the cell.
Between signals, the neuron membrane’s potential is held in a state of readiness, called the resting potential.
Like a rubber band stretched out and waiting to spring into action, ions line up on either side of the cell
membrane, ready to rush across the membrane when the neuron goes active and the membrane opens its
gates. Ions in high-concentration areas are ready to move to low-concentration areas, and positive ions are
ready to move to areas with a negative charge.
In the resting state, sodium (Na+) is at higher concentrations outside the cell, so it will tend to move into the
cell. Potassium (K+), on the other hand, is more concentrated inside the cell, and will tend to move out of the
cell (Figure 3.10). In addition, the inside of the cell is slightly negatively charged compared to the outside, due
to the activity of the sodium-potassium pump. This pump actively transports three sodium ions out of the cell
for every two potassium ions in, creating a net negative charge inside the cell. This provides an additional
force on sodium, causing it to move into the cell.

Summary
3.1 Human Genetics
Genes are sequences of DNA that code for a particular trait. Different versions of a gene are called
alleles—sometimes alleles can be classified as dominant or recessive. A dominant allele always results in the
dominant phenotype. In order to exhibit a recessive phenotype, an individual must be homozygous for the
recessive allele. Genes affect both physical and psychological characteristics. Ultimately, how and when a gene
is expressed, and what the outcome will be—in terms of both physical and psychological characteristics—is a
function of the interaction between our genes and our environments.
3.2 Cells of the Nervous System
Glia and neurons are the two cell types that make up the nervous system. While glia generally play supporting
roles, the communication between neurons is fundamental to all of the functions associated with the nervous
system. Neuronal communication is made possible by the neuron’s specialized structures. The soma contains
the cell nucleus, and the dendrites extend from the soma in tree-like branches. The axon is another major
extension of the cell body; axons are often covered by a myelin sheath, which increases the speed of
transmission of neural impulses. At the end of the axon are terminal buttons that contain synaptic vesicles
filled with neurotransmitters.
Neuronal communication is an electrochemical event. The dendrites contain receptors for neurotransmitters
released by nearby neurons. If the signals received from other neurons are sufficiently strong, an action
potential will travel down the length of the axon to the terminal buttons, resulting in the release of
neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. Action potentials operate on the all-or-none principle and involve

the movement of Na+ and K+ across the neuronal membrane.
Different neurotransmitters are associated with different functions. Often, psychological disorders involve
imbalances in a given neurotransmitter system. Therefore, psychotropic drugs are prescribed in an attempt to
bring the neurotransmitters back into balance. Drugs can act either as agonists or as antagonists for a given
neurotransmitter system.
3.3 Parts of the Nervous System
The brain and spinal cord make up the central nervous system. The peripheral nervous system is comprised of
the somatic and autonomic nervous systems. The somatic nervous system transmits sensory and motor
signals to and from the central nervous system. The autonomic nervous system controls the function of our
organs and glands, and can be divided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions. Sympathetic
activation prepares us for fight or flight, while parasympathetic activation is associated with normal
functioning under relaxed conditions.
3.4 The Brain and Spinal Cord
The brain consists of two hemispheres, each controlling the opposite side of the body. Each hemisphere can be
subdivided into different lobes: frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital. In addition to the lobes of the
cerebral cortex, the forebrain includes the thalamus (sensory relay) and limbic system (emotion and memory
circuit). The midbrain contains the reticular formation, which is important for sleep and arousal, as well as the
substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area. These structures are important for movement, reward, and
addictive processes. The hindbrain contains the structures of the brainstem (medulla, pons, and midbrain),
which control automatic functions like breathing and blood pressure. The hindbrain also contains the
cerebellum, which helps coordinate movement and certain types of memories.
Individuals with brain damage have been studied extensively to provide information about the role of different
areas of the brain, and recent advances in technology allow us to glean similar information by imaging brain
structure and function. These techniques include CT, PET, MRI, fMRI, and EEG.
3.5 The Endocrine System
The glands of the endocrine system secrete hormones to regulate normal body functions. The hypothalamus
serves as the interface between the nervous system and the endocrine system, and it controls the secretions of
the pituitary. The pituitary serves as the master gland, controlling the secretions of all other glands. The
thyroid secretes thyroxine, which is important for basic metabolic processes and growth; the adrenal glands
secrete hormones involved in the stress response; the pancreas secretes hormones that regulate blood sugar
levels; and the ovaries and testes produce sex hormones that regulate sexual motivation and behavior.

The activation of hair cells is a mechanical process: the stimulation of the hair cell ultimately leads to
activation of the cell. As hair cells become activated, they generate neural impulses that travel along the
auditory nerve to the brain. Auditory information is shuttled to the inferior colliculus, the medial geniculate
nucleus of the thalamus, and finally to the auditory cortex in the temporal lobe of the brain for processing. Like
the visual system, there is also evidence suggesting that information about auditory recognition and
localization is processed in parallel streams (Rauschecker & Tian, 2000; Renier et al., 2009).
Pitch Perception
Different frequencies of sound waves are associated with differences in our perception of the pitch of those
sounds. Low-frequency sounds are lower pitched, and high-frequency sounds are higher pitched. How does
the auditory system differentiate among various pitches?
Several theories have been proposed to account for pitch perception. We’ll discuss two of them here: temporal
theory and place theory. The temporal theory of pitch perception asserts that frequency is coded by the
activity level of a sensory neuron. This would mean that a given hair cell would fire action potentials related to
the frequency of the sound wave. While this is a very intuitive explanation, we detect such a broad range of
frequencies (20–20,000 Hz) that the frequency of action potentials fired by hair cells cannot account for the
entire range. Because of properties related to sodium channels on the neuronal membrane that are involved in
action potentials, there is a point at which a cell cannot fire any faster (Shamma, 2001).
The place theory of pitch perception suggests that different portions of the basilar membrane are sensitive to
sounds of different frequencies. More specifically, the base of the basilar membrane responds best to high
frequencies and the tip of the basilar membrane responds best to low frequencies. Therefore, hair cells that
are in the base portion would be labeled as high-pitch receptors, while those in the tip of basilar membrane
would be labeled as low-pitch receptors (Shamma, 2001).
In reality, both theories explain different aspects of pitch perception. At frequencies up to about 4000 Hz, it is
clear that both the rate of action potentials and place contribute to our perception of pitch. However, much
higher frequency sounds can only be encoded using place cues (Shamma, 2001).
Sound Localization
The ability to locate sound in our environments is an important part of hearing. Localizing sound could be
considered similar to the way that we perceive depth in our visual fields. Like the monocular and binocular
cues that provided information about depth, the auditory system uses both monaural (one-eared) and
binaural (two-eared) cues to localize sound.
Each pinna interacts with incoming sound waves differently, depending on the sound’s source relative to our
bodies. This interaction provides a monaural cue that is helpful in locating sounds that occur above or below
and in front or behind us. The sound waves received by your two ears from sounds that come from directly
above, below, in front, or behind you would be identical; therefore, monaural cues are essential (Grothe, Pecka,
& McAlpine, 2010).
Binaural cues, on the other hand, provide information on the location of a sound along a horizontal axis by
relying on differences in patterns of vibration of the eardrum between our two ears. If a sound comes from an
off-center location, it creates two types of binaural cues: interaural level differences and interaural timing
differences. Interaural level difference refers to the fact that a sound coming from the right side of your body
is more intense at your right ear than at your left ear because of the attenuation of the sound wave as it passes
through your head. Interaural timing difference refers to the small difference in the time at which a given
sound wave arrives at each ear (Figure 5.19). Certain brain areas monitor these differences to construct where
along a horizontal axis a sound originates (Grothe et al., 2010).

Hearing Loss
Deafness is the partial or complete inability to hear. Some people are born without hearing, which is known as
congenital deafness. Other people suffer from conductive hearing loss, which is due to a problem delivering
sound energy to the cochlea. Causes for conductive hearing loss include blockage of the ear canal, a hole in the
tympanic membrane, problems with the ossicles, or fluid in the space between the eardrum and cochlea.
Another group of people suffer from sensorineural hearing loss, which is the most common form of hearing
loss. Sensorineural hearing loss can be caused by many factors, such as aging, head or acoustic trauma,
infections and diseases (such as measles or mumps), medications, environmental effects such as noise
exposure (noise-induced hearing loss, as shown in Figure 5.20), tumors, and toxins (such as those found in
certain solvents and metals).
FIGURE 5.20 Environmental factors that can lead to sensorineural hearing loss include regular exposure to loud
music or construction equipment. (a) Musical performers and (b) construction workers are at risk for this type of
hearing loss. (credit a: modification of work by ""GillyBerlin_Flickr""/Flickr; credit b: modification of work by Nick
Allen)
Given the mechanical nature by which the sound wave stimulus is transmitted from the eardrum through the
ossicles to the oval window of the cochlea, some degree of hearing loss is inevitable. With conductive hearing
5.4 • Hearing 163
loss, hearing problems are associated with a failure in the vibration of the eardrum and/or movement of the
ossicles. These problems are often dealt with through devices like hearing aids that amplify incoming sound
waves to make vibration of the eardrum and movement of the ossicles more likely to occur.
When the hearing problem is associated with a failure to transmit neural signals from the cochlea to the brain,
it is called sensorineural hearing loss. One disease that results in sensorineural hearing loss is Ménière's
disease. Although not well understood, Ménière's disease results in a degeneration of inner ear structures that
can lead to hearing loss, tinnitus (constant ringing or buzzing), vertigo (a sense of spinning), and an increase
in pressure within the inner ear (Semaan & Megerian, 2011). This kind of loss cannot be treated with hearing
aids, but some individuals might be candidates for a cochlear implant as a treatment option. Cochlear
implants are electronic devices that consist of a microphone, a speech processor, and an electrode array. The
device receives incoming sound information and directly stimulates the auditory nerve to transmit
information to the brain.

Deaf Culture
In the United States and other places around the world, deaf people have their own language, schools, and
customs. This is called deaf culture. In the United States, deaf individuals often communicate using American
Sign Language (ASL); ASL has no verbal component and is based entirely on visual signs and gestures. The
primary mode of communication is signing. One of the values of deaf culture is to continue traditions like using
sign language rather than teaching deaf children to try to speak, read lips, or have cochlear implant surgery.
When a child is diagnosed as deaf, parents have difficult decisions to make. Should the child be enrolled in
mainstream schools and taught to verbalize and read lips? Or should the child be sent to a school for deaf
children to learn ASL and have significant exposure to deaf culture? Do you think there might be differences in
the way that parents approach these decisions depending on whether or not they are also deaf?

Vision and hearing have received an incredible amount of attention from researchers over the years. While
there is still much to be learned about how these sensory systems work, we have a much better understanding
of them than of our other sensory modalities. In this section, we will explore our chemical senses (taste and
smell) and our body senses (touch, temperature, pain, balance, and body position).
The Chemical Senses
Taste (gustation) and smell (olfaction) are called chemical senses because both have sensory receptors that
respond to molecules in the food we eat or in the air we breathe. There is a pronounced interaction between
our chemical senses. For example, when we describe the flavor of a given food, we are really referring to both
gustatory and olfactory properties of the food working in combination.

Taste (Gustation)
You have learned since elementary school that there are four basic groupings of taste: sweet, salty, sour, and
bitter. Research demonstrates, however, that we have at least six taste groupings. Umami is our fifth taste.
Umami is actually a Japanese word that roughly translates to yummy, and it is associated with a taste for
monosodium glutamate (Kinnamon & Vandenbeuch, 2009). There is also a growing body of experimental
evidence suggesting that we possess a taste for the fatty content of a given food (Mizushige, Inoue, & Fushiki,
2007).
Molecules from the food and beverages we consume dissolve in our saliva and interact with taste receptors on
our tongue and in our mouth and throat. Taste buds are formed by groupings of taste receptor cells with hair-
like extensions that protrude into the central pore of the taste bud (Figure 5.21). Taste buds have a life cycle of
ten days to two weeks, so even destroying some by burning your tongue won’t have any long-term effect; they
just grow right back. Taste molecules bind to receptors on this extension and cause chemical changes within
the sensory cell that result in neural impulses being transmitted to the brain via different nerves, depending
on where the receptor is located. Taste information is transmitted to the medulla, thalamus, and limbic
system, and to the gustatory cortex, which is tucked underneath the overlap between the frontal and temporal
lobes (Maffei, Haley, & Fontanini, 2012; Roper, 2013).

to nerves. (b) This micrograph shows a close-up view of the tongue’s surface. (credit a: modification of work by
Jonas Töle; credit b: scale-bar data from Matt Russell)
Smell (Olfaction)
Olfactory receptor cells are located in a mucous membrane at the top of the nose. Small hair-like extensions
from these receptors serve as the sites for odor molecules dissolved in the mucus to interact with chemical
receptors located on these extensions (Figure 5.22). Once an odor molecule has bound a given receptor,
chemical changes within the cell result in signals being sent to the olfactory bulb: a bulb-like structure at the
tip of the frontal lobe where the olfactory nerves begin. From the olfactory bulb, information is sent to regions
of the limbic system and to the primary olfactory cortex, which is located very near the gustatory cortex
(Lodovichi & Belluscio, 2012; Spors et al., 2013).
5.5 • The Other Senses 165
FIGURE 5.22 Olfactory receptors are the hair-like parts that extend from the olfactory bulb into the mucous
membrane of the nasal cavity.
There is tremendous variation in the sensitivity of the olfactory systems of different species. We often think of
dogs as having far superior olfactory systems than our own, and indeed, dogs can do some remarkable things
with their noses. There is some evidence to suggest that dogs can “smell” dangerous drops in blood glucose
levels as well as cancerous tumors (Wells, 2010). Dogs’ extraordinary olfactory abilities may be due to the
increased number of functional genes for olfactory receptors (between 800 and 1200), compared to the fewer
than 400 observed in humans and other primates (Niimura & Nei, 2007).
Many species respond to chemical messages, known as pheromones, sent by another individual (Wysocki &
Preti, 2004). Pheromonal communication often involves providing information about the reproductive status
of a potential mate. So, for example, when a female rat is ready to mate, it secretes pheromonal signals that
draw attention from nearby male rats. Pheromonal activation is actually an important component in eliciting
sexual behavior in the male rat (Furlow, 1996, 2012; Purvis & Haynes, 1972; Sachs, 1997). There has also been
a good deal of research (and controversy) about pheromones in humans (Comfort, 1971; Russell, 1976;
Wolfgang-Kimball, 1992; Weller, 1998).
Touch, Thermoception, and Nociception
A number of receptors are distributed throughout the skin to respond to various touch-related stimuli (Figure
5.23). These receptors include Meissner’s corpuscles, Pacinian corpuscles, Merkel’s disks, and Ruffini
corpuscles. Meissner’s corpuscles respond to pressure and lower frequency vibrations, and Pacinian
corpuscles detect transient pressure and higher frequency vibrations. Merkel’s disks respond to light
pressure, while Ruffini corpuscles detect stretch (Abraira & Ginty, 2013).

Context: FIGURE 3.6 In this Punnett square, N represents the normal allele, and p represents the recessive allele that is associated with PKU. If two individuals mate who are both heterozygous for the allele associated with PKU, their offspring have a 25% chance of expressing the PKU phenotype. Where do harmful genes that contribute to diseases like PKU come from? Gene mutations provide one source of harmful genes. A mutation is a sudden, permanent change in a gene. While many mutations can be harmful or lethal, once in a while, a mutation benefits an individual by giving that person an advantage over those who do not have the mutation. Recall that the theory of evolution asserts that individuals best adapted to their particular environments are more likely to reproduce and pass on their genes to future generations. In order for this process to occur, there must be competition—more technically, there must be variability in genes (and resultant traits) that allow for variation in adaptability to the environment. If a population consisted of identical individuals, then any dramatic changes in the environment would affect everyone in the same way, and there would be no variation in selection. In contrast, diversity in genes and associated traits allows some individuals to perform slightly better than others when faced with environmental change. This creates a distinct advantage for individuals best suited for their environments in terms of successful reproduction and genetic transmission. Human Diversity This chapter focuses on biology. Later in this course you will learn about social psychology and issues of race, prejudice, and discrimination. When we focus strictly on biology, race becomes a weak construct. After the sequencing of the human genome at the turn of the millennium, many scientists began to argue that race was not a useful variable in genetic research and that its continued use represents a potential source of confusion and harm. The racial categories that some believed to be helpful in studying genetic diversity in humans are largely irrelevant. A person's skin tone, eye color, and hair texture are functions of their genetic makeups, but there is actually more genetic variation within a given racial category than there is between racial categories. In some cases, focus on race has led to difficulties with misdiagnoses and/or misinterpretations of genetic data. For example, if a person is diagnosed with a genetic disorder, he or she may be misidentified as having a different disorder, such as cystic fibrosis or sickle cell anemia, when in fact the person has the disorder associated with his or her race (e.g., African American or Caucasian). In addition, some researchers have argued that discrimination against people of a particular race or ethnic group is based on racial stereotypes rather than biological differences. As a result, it is important to recognize that there are many different types of racial diversity, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.","{""sections"": [""States of Consciousness/Sleep and Why We Sleep"", ""Sensation and Perception"", ""Biopsychology/The Brain and Spinal Cord""], ""pages"": [""115"", ""176"", ""90""]}"

4.6 Other States of Consciousness
Our lives involve regular, dramatic changes in the degree to which we are aware of our
surroundings and our internal states. While awake, we feel alert and aware of the many important things going
on around us. Our experiences change dramatically while we are in deep sleep and once again when we are
dreaming. Some people also experience altered states of consciousness through meditation, hypnosis, or
alcohol and other drugs.
This chapter will discuss states of consciousness with a particular emphasis on sleep. The different stages of
sleep will be identified, and sleep disorders will be described. The chapter will close with discussions of altered
states of consciousness produced by psychoactive drugs, hypnosis, and meditation.

4.1 What Is Consciousness?
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Understand what is meant by consciousness
• Explain how circadian rhythms are involved in regulating the sleep-wake cycle, and how circadian cycles can be
disrupted
• Discuss the concept of sleep debt
Consciousness describes our awareness of internal and external stimuli. Awareness of internal stimuli
includes feeling pain, hunger, thirst, sleepiness, and being aware of our thoughts and emotions. Awareness of
external stimuli includes experiences such as seeing the light from the sun, feeling the warmth of a room, and
hearing the voice of a friend.
We experience different states of consciousness and different levels of awareness on a regular basis. We might
even describe consciousness as a continuum that ranges from full awareness to a deep sleep. Sleep is a state
marked by relatively low levels of physical activity and reduced sensory awareness that is distinct from periods
of rest that occur during wakefulness. Wakefulness is characterized by high levels of sensory awareness,
thought, and behavior. Beyond being awake or asleep, there are many other states of consciousness people
experience. These include daydreaming, intoxication, and unconsciousness due to anesthesia. We might also
experience unconscious states of being via drug-induced anesthesia for medical purposes. Often, we are not
completely aware of our surroundings, even when we are fully awake. For instance, have you ever daydreamed
while driving home from work or school without really thinking about the drive itself? You were capable of
engaging in the all of the complex tasks involved with operating a motor vehicle even though you were not
aware of doing so. Many of these processes, like much of psychological behavior, are rooted in our biology.
Biological Rhythms
Biological rhythms are internal rhythms of biological activity. A woman’s menstrual cycle is an example of a
biological rhythm—a recurring, cyclical pattern of bodily changes. One complete menstrual cycle takes about
28 days—a lunar month—but many biological cycles are much shorter. For example, body temperature
fluctuates cyclically over a 24-hour period (Figure 4.2). Alertness is associated with higher body temperatures,
and sleepiness with lower body temperatures.
FIGURE 4.2 This chart illustrates the circadian change in body temperature over 28 hours in a group of eight young
men. Body temperature rises throughout the waking day, peaking in the afternoon, and falls during sleep with the
lowest point occurring during the very early morning hours.

This pattern of temperature fluctuation, which repeats every day, is one example of a circadian rhythm. A
circadian rhythm is a biological rhythm that takes place over a period of about 24 hours. Our sleep-wake
cycle, which is linked to our environment’s natural light-dark cycle, is perhaps the most obvious example of a
circadian rhythm, but we also have daily fluctuations in heart rate, blood pressure, blood sugar, and body
temperature. Some circadian rhythms play a role in changes in our state of consciousness.
If we have biological rhythms, then is there some sort of biological clock? In the brain, the hypothalamus,
which lies above the pituitary gland, is a main center of homeostasis. Homeostasis is the tendency to maintain
a balance, or optimal level, within a biological system.
The brain’s clock mechanism is located in an area of the hypothalamus known as the suprachiasmatic
nucleus (SCN). The axons of light-sensitive neurons in the retina provide information to the SCN based on the
amount of light present, allowing this internal clock to be synchronized with the outside world (Klein, Moore, &
Reppert, 1991; Welsh, Takahashi, & Kay, 2010) (Figure 4.3).
FIGURE 4.3 The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) serves as the brain’s clock mechanism. The clock sets itself with
light information received through projections from the retina.
Problems With Circadian Rhythms
Generally, and for most people, our circadian cycles are aligned with the outside world. For example, most
people sleep during the night and are awake during the day. One important regulator of sleep-wake cycles is
the hormone melatonin. The pineal gland, an endocrine structure located inside the brain that releases
melatonin, is thought to be involved in the regulation of various biological rhythms and of the immune system
during sleep (Hardeland, Pandi-Perumal, & Cardinali, 2006). Melatonin release is stimulated by darkness and
inhibited by light.
There are individual differences in regard to our sleep-wake cycle. For instance, some people would say they
are morning people, while others would consider themselves to be night owls. These individual differences in
circadian patterns of activity are known as a person’s chronotype, and research demonstrates that morning
larks and night owls differ with regard to sleep regulation (Taillard, Philip, Coste, Sagaspe, & Bioulac, 2003).
Sleep regulation refers to the brain’s control of switching between sleep and wakefulness as well as
coordinating this cycle with the outside world.

Insufficient Sleep
When people have difficulty getting sleep due to their work or the demands of day-to-day life, they accumulate
a sleep debt. A person with a sleep debt does not get sufficient sleep on a chronic basis. The consequences of
sleep debt include decreased levels of alertness and mental efficiency. Interestingly, since the advent of
electric light, the amount of sleep that people get has declined. While we certainly welcome the convenience of
having the darkness lit up, we also suffer the consequences of reduced amounts of sleep because we are more
active during the nighttime hours than our ancestors were. As a result, many of us sleep less than 7–8 hours a
night and accrue a sleep debt. While there is tremendous variation in any given individual’s sleep needs, the
National Sleep Foundation (n.d.) cites research to estimate that newborns require the most sleep (between 12
and 18 hours a night) and that this amount declines to just 7–9 hours by the time we are adults.
If you lie down to take a nap and fall asleep very easily, chances are you may have sleep debt. Given that college
students are notorious for suffering from significant sleep debt (Hicks, Fernandez, & Pellegrini, 2001; Hicks,
Johnson, & Pellegrini, 1992; Miller, Shattuck, & Matsangas, 2010), chances are you and your classmates deal
with sleep debt-related issues on a regular basis. In 2015, the National Sleep Foundation updated their sleep
duration hours, to better accommodate individual differences. Table 4.1 shows the new recommendations,
which describe sleep durations that are “recommended”, “may be appropriate”, and “not recommended”.

Sleep debt and sleep deprivation have significant negative psychological and physiological consequences
Figure 4.5. As mentioned earlier, lack of sleep can result in decreased mental alertness and cognitive function.
4.1 • What Is Consciousness? 113
In addition, sleep deprivation often results in depression-like symptoms. These effects can occur as a function
of accumulated sleep debt or in response to more acute periods of sleep deprivation. It may surprise you to
know that sleep deprivation is associated with obesity, increased blood pressure, increased levels of stress
hormones, and reduced immune functioning (Banks & Dinges, 2007). A sleep deprived individual generally
will fall asleep more quickly than if they were not sleep deprived. Some sleep-deprived individuals have
difficulty staying awake when they stop moving (example sitting and watching television or driving a car). That
is why individuals suffering from sleep deprivation can also put themselves and others at risk when they put
themselves behind the wheel of a car or work with dangerous machinery. Some research suggests that sleep
deprivation affects cognitive and motor function as much as, if not more than, alcohol intoxication (Williamson
& Feyer, 2000). Research shows that the most severe effects of sleep deprivation occur when a person stays
awake for more than 24 hours (Killgore & Weber, 2014; Killgore et al., 2007), or following repeated nights with
fewer than four hours in bed (Wickens, Hutchins, Lauk, Seebook, 2015). For example, irritability, distractibility,
and impairments in cognitive and moral judgment can occur with fewer than four hours of sleep. If someone
stays awake for 48 consecutive hours, they could start to hallucinate.

may be the most obvious, many body systems are negatively impacted by lack of sleep. (credit: modification of work

The amount of sleep we get varies across the lifespan. When we are very young, we spend up to 16 hours a day
sleeping. As we grow older, we sleep less. In fact, a meta-analysis, which is a study that combines the results of
many related studies, conducted within the last decade indicates that by the time we are 65 years old, we
average fewer than 7 hours of sleep per day (Ohayon, Carskadon, Guilleminault, & Vitiello, 2004).

between 73 and 79 years old (Singh & Siahpush, 2006), we can expect to spend approximately 25 years of our
lives sleeping. Some animals never sleep (e.g., some fish and amphibian species); other animals sleep very
little without apparent negative consequences (e.g., giraffes); yet some animals (e.g., rats) die after two weeks
of sleep deprivation (Siegel, 2008). Why do we devote so much time to sleeping? Is it absolutely essential that
we sleep? This section will consider these questions and explore various explanations for why we sleep.
What is Sleep?
You have read that sleep is distinguished by low levels of physical activity and reduced sensory awareness. As
discussed by Siegel (2008), a definition of sleep must also include mention of the interplay of the circadian and
homeostatic mechanisms that regulate sleep. Homeostatic regulation of sleep is evidenced by sleep rebound
following sleep deprivation. Sleep rebound refers to the fact that a sleep-deprived individual will fall asleep
more quickly during subsequent opportunities for sleep. Sleep is characterized by certain patterns of activity
of the brain that can be visualized using electroencephalography (EEG), and different phases of sleep can be
differentiated using EEG as well.
Sleep-wake cycles seem to be controlled by multiple brain areas acting in conjunction with one another. Some
of these areas include the thalamus, the hypothalamus, and the pons. As already mentioned, the
hypothalamus contains the SCN—the biological clock of the body—in addition to other nuclei that, in
conjunction with the thalamus, regulate slow-wave sleep. The pons is important for regulating rapid eye
movement (REM) sleep (National Institutes of Health, n.d.).
Sleep is also associated with the secretion and regulation of a number of hormones from several endocrine
glands including: melatonin, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and growth
hormone (National Institutes of Health, n.d.). You have read that the pineal gland releases melatonin during
sleep (Figure 4.6). Melatonin is thought to be involved in the regulation of various biological rhythms and the
immune system (Hardeland et al., 2006). During sleep, the pituitary gland secretes both FSH and LH which are
important in regulating the reproductive system (Christensen et al., 2012; Sofikitis et al., 2008). The pituitary
gland also secretes growth hormone, during sleep, which plays a role in physical growth and maturation as
well as other metabolic processes (Bartke, Sun, & Longo, 2013).
FIGURE 4.6 The pineal and pituitary glands secrete a number of hormones during sleep.
Why Do We Sleep?
Given the central role that sleep plays in our lives and the number of adverse consequences that have been
associated with sleep deprivation, one would think that we would have a clear understanding of why it is that
we sleep. Unfortunately, this is not the case; however, several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the
function of sleep.
4.2 • Sleep and Why We Sleep 115
Adaptive Function of Sleep
One popular hypothesis of sleep incorporates the perspective of evolutionary psychology. Evolutionary
psychology is a discipline that studies how universal patterns of behavior and cognitive processes have
evolved over time as a result of natural selection. Variations and adaptations in cognition and behavior make
individuals more or less successful in reproducing and passing their genes to their offspring. One hypothesis
from this perspective might argue that sleep is essential to restore resources that are expended during the day.
Just as bears hibernate in the winter when resources are scarce, perhaps people sleep at night to reduce their
energy expenditures. While this is an intuitive explanation of sleep, there is little research that supports this
explanation. In fact, it has been suggested that there is no reason to think that energetic demands could not be
addressed with periods of rest and inactivity (Frank, 2006; Rial et al., 2007), and some research has actually
found a negative correlation between energetic demands and the amount of time spent sleeping (Capellini,
Barton, McNamara, Preston, & Nunn, 2008).
Another evolutionary hypothesis of sleep holds that our sleep patterns evolved as an adaptive response to
predatory risks, which increase in darkness. Thus we sleep in safe areas to reduce the chance of harm. Again,
this is an intuitive and appealing explanation for why we sleep. Perhaps our ancestors spent extended periods
of time asleep to reduce attention to themselves from potential predators. Comparative research indicates,
however, that the relationship that exists between predatory risk and sleep is very complex and equivocal.
Some research suggests that species that face higher predatory risks sleep fewer hours than other species
(Capellini et al., 2008), while other researchers suggest there is no relationship between the amount of time a
given species spends in deep sleep and its predation risk (Lesku, Roth, Amlaner, & Lima, 2006).
It is quite possible that sleep serves no single universally adaptive function, and different species have evolved
different patterns of sleep in response to their unique evolutionary pressures. While we have discussed the
negative outcomes associated with sleep deprivation, it should be pointed out that there are many benefits that
are associated with adequate amounts of sleep. A few such benefits listed by the National Sleep Foundation
(n.d.) include maintaining healthy weight, lowering stress levels, improving mood, and increasing motor
coordination, as well as a number of benefits related to cognition and memory formation.
Cognitive Function of Sleep
Another theory regarding why we sleep involves sleep’s importance for cognitive function and memory
formation (Rattenborg, Lesku, Martinez-Gonzalez, & Lima, 2007). Indeed, we know sleep deprivation results in
disruptions in cognition and memory deficits (Brown, 2012), leading to impairments in our abilities to
maintain attention, make decisions, and recall long-term memories. Moreover, these impairments become
more severe as the amount of sleep deprivation increases (Alhola & Polo-Kantola, 2007). Furthermore, slow-
wave sleep after learning a new task can improve resultant performance on that task (Huber, Ghilardi,
Massimini, & Tononi, 2004) and seems essential for effective memory formation (Stickgold, 2005).
Understanding the impact of sleep on cognitive function should help you understand that cramming all night
for a test may be not effective and can even prove counterproductive.

Getting the optimal amount of sleep has also been associated with other cognitive benefits. Research indicates
that included among these possible benefits are increased capacities for creative thinking (Cai, Mednick,
Harrison, Kanady, & Mednick, 2009; Wagner, Gais, Haider, Verleger, & Born, 2004), language learning (Fenn,
Nusbaum, & Margoliash, 2003; Gómez, Bootzin, & Nadel, 2006), and inferential judgments (Ellenbogen, Hu,
Payne, Titone, & Walker, 2007). It is possible that even the processing of emotional information is influenced by
certain aspects of sleep (Walker, 2009).

4.3 Stages of Sleep
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Differentiate between REM and non-REM sleep
• Describe the differences between the three stages of non-REM sleep
• Understand the role that REM and non-REM sleep play in learning and memory
Sleep is not a uniform state of being. Instead, sleep is composed of several different stages that can be
differentiated from one another by the patterns of brain wave activity that occur during each stage. While
awake, our brain wave activity is dominated by beta waves. As compared to the brain wave patterns while
asleep, beta waves have the highest frequency (13–30 Hz) and lowest amplitude, and they tend to show more
variability. As we begin to fall asleep, our brain wave activity changes. These changes can be visualized using
an EEG and are distinguished from one another by both the frequency and amplitude of the brain wave. The
frequency of a brain wave is how many brain waves occur in a second, and frequency is measured in Hertz
(Hz). Amplitude is the height of the brain wave (Figure 4.7). Sleep can be divided into two different general
phases: REM sleep and non-REM (NREM) sleep. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is characterized by darting
movements of the eyes under closed eyelids. Brain waves during REM sleep appear very similar to brain waves
during wakefulness. In contrast, non-REM (NREM) sleep is subdivided into three stages distinguished from
each other and from wakefulness by characteristic patterns of brain waves. The first three stages of sleep are
NREM sleep, typically followed by REM sleep. In this section, we will discuss each of these stages of sleep and
their associated patterns of brain wave activity.
FIGURE 4.7 Brainwave activity changes dramatically across the different stages of sleep. (credit ""sleeping"":
modification of work by Ryan Vaarsi)
NREM Stages of Sleep
As we begin to fall asleep, we enter NREM sleep, and brain wave patterns decrease in frequency and increase
in amplitude. The first stage of NREM sleep is known as stage 1 sleep. Stage 1 sleep is a transitional phase that
occurs between wakefulness and sleep, the period during which we drift off to sleep. During this time, there is
a slowdown in both the rates of respiration and heartbeat. In addition, stage 1 sleep involves a marked
4.3 • Stages of Sleep 117
decrease in both overall muscle tension and core body temperature.
In terms of brain wave activity, stage 1 sleep is associated with both alpha and theta waves. The early portion of
stage 1 sleep produces alpha waves. These patterns of electrical activity (waves) resemble that of someone
who is very relaxed, yet awake, but they have less variability (are more synchronized) and are relatively lower
in frequency (8–12 Hz) and higher in amplitude than beta waves (Figure 4.8). As an individual continues
through stage 1 sleep, there is an increase in theta wave activity. Theta waves are even lower frequency (4–7
Hz), and higher in amplitude, than the alpha wave patterns. It is relatively easy to wake someone from stage 1
sleep; in fact, people often report that they have not been asleep if they are awoken during stage 1 sleep.
FIGURE 4.8 Brainwave activity changes dramatically across the different stages of sleep.
As we move into stage 2 sleep, the body goes into a state of deep relaxation. Theta waves still dominate the
activity of the brain, but they are interrupted by brief bursts of activity known as sleep spindles (Figure 4.9). A
sleep spindle is a rapid burst of higher frequency brain waves that may be important for learning and memory
(Fogel & Smith, 2011; Poe, Walsh, & Bjorness, 2010). In addition, the appearance of K-complexes is often
associated with stage 2 sleep. A K-complex is a very high amplitude pattern of brain activity that may in some
cases occur in response to environmental stimuli. Thus, K-complexes might serve as a bridge to higher levels
of arousal in response to what is going on in our environments (Halász, 1993; Steriade & Amzica, 1998).
FIGURE 4.9 Stage 2 sleep is characterized by the appearance of both sleep spindles and K-complexes.
NREM stage 3 sleep is often referred to as deep sleep or slow-wave sleep because this stage is characterized by
low frequency (less than 3 Hz), high amplitude delta waves (Figure 4.10). These delta waves have the lowest
frequency and highest amplitude of our sleeping brain wave patterns. During this time, an individual’s heart
rate and respiration slow dramatically, and it is much more difficult to awaken someone from sleep during
118 4 • States of Consciousness

stage 3 than during earlier stages. Interestingly, individuals who have increased levels of alpha brain wave
activity (more often associated with wakefulness and transition into stage 1 sleep) during stage 3 often report

REM Sleep
As mentioned earlier, REM sleep is marked by rapid movements of the eyes. The brain waves associated with
this stage of sleep are very similar to those observed when a person is awake, as shown in Figure 4.11, and this
is the period of sleep in which dreaming occurs. It is also associated with paralysis of muscle systems in the
body with the exception of those that make circulation and respiration possible. Therefore, no movement of
voluntary muscles occurs during REM sleep in a normal individual; REM sleep is often referred to as
paradoxical sleep because of this combination of high brain activity and lack of muscle tone. Like NREM sleep,
REM has been implicated in various aspects of learning and memory (Wagner, Gais, & Born, 2001; Siegel,
2001).
FIGURE 4.11 (a) A period of rapid eye movement is marked by the short red line segment. The brain waves
associated with REM sleep, outlined in the red box in (a), look very similar to those seen (b) during wakefulness.
If people are deprived of REM sleep and then allowed to sleep without disturbance, they will spend more time
in REM sleep in what would appear to be an effort to recoup the lost time in REM. This is known as the REM
rebound, and it suggests that REM sleep is also homeostatically regulated. Aside from the role that REM sleep
may play in processes related to learning and memory, REM sleep may also be involved in emotional

INTRODUCTION CHAPTER OUTLINE 4.1 What Is Consciousness? 4.2 Sleep and Why We Sleep 4.3 Stages of Sleep 4.4 Sleep Problems and Disorders 4.5 Substance Use and Abuse 4.6 Other States of Consciousness Our lives involve regular, dramatic changes in the degree to which we are aware of our surroundings and our internal states. While awake, we feel alert and aware of the many important things going on around us. Our experiences change dramatically while we are in deep sleep and once again when we are dreaming. Some people also experience altered states of consciousness through meditation, hypnosis, or alcohol and other drugs. This chapter will discuss states of consciousness with a particular emphasis on sleep. The different stages of sleep will be identified, and sleep disorders will be described. The chapter will close with discussions of altered states of consciousness produced by psychoactive drugs, hypnosis, and meditation. 4States of Consciousness 4.1 What Is Conscious Consciousness is the ability to perceive and understand the world around you. It is also the capacity to make decisions about what to do and how to act in order to achieve your goals. In this chapter, the term “consciousness” will be used to refer to both the state of being conscious and the process of making conscious decisions. The word consciousness is derived from two Greek words: κόσμος (kosmos), which means “world” or “universe,” and ἀναστήσειν (anastēsēn), meaning “to make aware.” In other words, consciousness refers to the awareness of one’s surroundings and of oneself as a part of that world. This awareness can be divided into three categories: (1) sensory awareness, (2) self-awareness (or self-consciousness), and (3) cognitive awareness. Sensory awareness is what we see, hear, touch, taste, smell, feel, think, remember, imagine, experience, and so on. Self-conscious awareness involves knowing who you are and what you think and feel. Cognitive awareness involves being able to understand and make sense of information that you receive from your senses and from other sources, such as books, magazines, newspapers, TV, radio, movies, music, books, or the Internet. These three categories of awareness are not mutually exclusive. For example, some people may have a high level of sensory and selfconscious awareness while having low levels of cognitive and emotional awareness. Others may have low sensory, but high self and cognitive consciousness. Still others may have high sensory consciousness but low self, cognitive or emotional consciousness. In addition to these categories, there are two other types of conscious awareness that are important to understand. One is called reflective awareness (also known as introspection or self-reflection). The other is called experiential awareness or subjective experience. Reflective awareness occurs when you pay attention to your own thoughts, feelings, perceptions, sensations, memories, emotions, thoughts about your thoughts, feelings about yourself, etc. When you reflect on yourself and your experiences, it is possible to gain a better understanding of yourself. On the other hand, experiencing is when your attention is focused on something that is happening to you or something that has happened to someone else. Experiencing is often associated with feelings of sadness, anger, fear, anxiety, joy, happiness, sadness","{""sections"": [""States of Consciousness/Substance Use and Abuse"", ""States of Consciousness/Sleep Problems and Disorders""], ""pages"": [""127"", ""129"", ""121""]}"
4,"FIGURE 6.8 John B. Watson used the principles of classical conditioning in the study of human emotion.
Watson’s ideas were influenced by Pavlov’s work. According to Watson, human behavior, just like animal
behavior, is primarily the result of conditioned responses. Whereas Pavlov’s work with dogs involved the
conditioning of reflexes, Watson believed the same principles could be extended to the conditioning of human
emotions (Watson, 1919).
In 1920, while chair of the psychology department at Johns Hopkins University, Watson and his graduate
student, Rosalie Rayner, conducted research on a baby nicknamed Little Albert. Rayner and Watson’s
experiments with Little Albert demonstrated how fears can be conditioned using classical conditioning.
Through these experiments, Little Albert was exposed to and conditioned to fear certain things. Initially he was
presented with various neutral stimuli, including a rabbit, a dog, a monkey, masks, cotton wool, and a white
rat. He was not afraid of any of these things. Then Watson, with the help of Rayner, conditioned Little Albert to
associate these stimuli with an emotion—fear. For example, Watson handed Little Albert the white rat, and
Little Albert enjoyed playing with it. Then Watson made a loud sound, by striking a hammer against a metal
bar hanging behind Little Albert’s head, each time Little Albert touched the rat. Little Albert was frightened by
the sound—demonstrating a reflexive fear of sudden loud noises—and began to cry. Watson repeatedly paired
the loud sound with the white rat. Soon Little Albert became frightened by the white rat alone. In this case,
what are the UCS, CS, UCR, and CR? Days later, Little Albert demonstrated stimulus generalization—he became
afraid of other furry things: a rabbit, a furry coat, and even a Santa Claus mask (Figure 6.9). Watson had
succeeded in conditioning a fear response in Little Albert, thus demonstrating that emotions could become
conditioned responses. It had been Watson’s intention to produce a phobia—a persistent, excessive fear of a
specific object or situation— through conditioning alone, thus countering Freud’s view that phobias are caused
by deep, hidden conflicts in the mind. However, there is no evidence that Little Albert experienced phobias in
later years. Little Albert’s mother moved away, ending the experiment. While Watson’s research provided new
insight into conditioning, it would be considered unethical by today’s standards.
FIGURE 6.9 Through stimulus generalization, Little Albert came to fear furry things, including Watson in a Santa
Claus mask.

As you watch the video, look closely at Little Albert’s reactions and the manner in which Watson and Rayner
present the stimuli before and after conditioning. Based on what you see, would you come to the same
conclusions as the researchers?
Advertising and Associative Learning
Advertising executives are pros at applying the principles of associative learning. Think about the car
commercials you have seen on television. Many of them feature an attractive model. By associating the model
with the car being advertised, you come to see the car as being desirable (Cialdini, 2008). You may be asking
yourself, does this advertising technique actually work? According to Cialdini (2008), men who viewed a car
commercial that included an attractive model later rated the car as being faster, more appealing, and better
designed than did men who viewed an advertisement for the same car minus the model.
Have you ever noticed how quickly advertisers cancel contracts with a famous athlete following a scandal? As far
as the advertiser is concerned, that athlete is no longer associated with positive feelings; therefore, the athlete
cannot be used as an unconditioned stimulus to condition the public to associate positive feelings (the
unconditioned response) with their product (the conditioned stimulus).
Now that you are aware of how associative learning works, see if you can find examples of these types of
advertisements on television, in magazines, or on the Internet.
6.3 Operant Conditioning
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Define operant conditioning
• Explain the difference between reinforcement and punishment
• Distinguish between reinforcement schedules
The previous section of this chapter focused on the type of associative learning known as classical
conditioning. Remember that in classical conditioning, something in the environment triggers a reflex
automatically, and researchers train the organism to react to a different stimulus. Now we turn to the second
type of associative learning, operant conditioning. In operant conditioning, organisms learn to associate a
behavior and its consequence (Table 6.1). A pleasant consequence makes that behavior more likely to be
repeated in the future. For example, Spirit, a dolphin at the National Aquarium in Baltimore, does a flip in the
air when her trainer blows a whistle. The consequence is that she gets a fish.

Classical and Operant Conditioning Compared
Classical Conditioning Operant Conditioning
Conditioning
approach
An unconditioned stimulus (such as food) is paired
with a neutral stimulus (such as a bell). The neutral
stimulus eventually becomes the conditioned
stimulus, which brings about the conditioned
response (salivation).
The target behavior is followed by
reinforcement or punishment to either
strengthen or weaken it, so that the
learner is more likely to exhibit the desired
behavior in the future.
Stimulus
timing
The stimulus occurs immediately before the
response.
The stimulus (either reinforcement or
punishment) occurs soon after the
response.
TABLE 6.1
Psychologist B. F. Skinner saw that classical conditioning is limited to existing behaviors that are reflexively
elicited, and it doesn’t account for new behaviors such as riding a bike. He proposed a theory about how such
behaviors come about. Skinner believed that behavior is motivated by the consequences we receive for the
behavior: the reinforcements and punishments. His idea that learning is the result of consequences is based
on the law of effect, which was first proposed by psychologist Edward Thorndike. According to the law of
effect, behaviors that are followed by consequences that are satisfying to the organism are more likely to be
repeated, and behaviors that are followed by unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated
(Thorndike, 1911). Essentially, if an organism does something that brings about a desired result, the organism
is more likely to do it again. If an organism does something that does not bring about a desired result, the
organism is less likely to do it again. An example of the law of effect is in employment. One of the reasons (and
often the main reason) we show up for work is because we get paid to do so. If we stop getting paid, we will
likely stop showing up—even if we love our job.
Working with Thorndike’s law of effect as his foundation, Skinner began conducting scientific experiments on
animals (mainly rats and pigeons) to determine how organisms learn through operant conditioning (Skinner,
1938). He placed these animals inside an operant conditioning chamber, which has come to be known as a
“Skinner box” (Figure 6.10). A Skinner box contains a lever (for rats) or disk (for pigeons) that the animal can
press or peck for a food reward via the dispenser. Speakers and lights can be associated with certain behaviors.
A recorder counts the number of responses made by the animal.

strengthened or weakened according to their consequences. (b) In a Skinner box, a rat presses a lever in an operant

In discussing operant conditioning, we use several everyday words—positive, negative, reinforcement, and
punishment—in a specialized manner. In operant conditioning, positive and negative do not mean good and
bad. Instead, positive means you are adding something, and negative means you are taking something away.
Reinforcement means you are increasing a behavior, and punishment means you are decreasing a behavior.
Reinforcement can be positive or negative, and punishment can also be positive or negative. All reinforcers
(positive or negative) increase the likelihood of a behavioral response. All punishers (positive or negative)
decrease the likelihood of a behavioral response. Now let’s combine these four terms: positive reinforcement,
negative reinforcement, positive punishment, and negative punishment (Table 6.2).
Positive and Negative Reinforcement and Punishment
Reinforcement Punishment
Positive Something is added to increase the likelihood of a
behavior.
Something is added to decrease the likelihood of a
behavior.
Negative Something is removed to increase the likelihood
of a behavior.
Something is removed to decrease the likelihood
of a behavior.
TABLE 6.2
Reinforcement
The most effective way to teach a person or animal a new behavior is with positive reinforcement. In positive
reinforcement, a desirable stimulus is added to increase a behavior.
For example, you tell your five-year-old son, Jerome, that if he cleans his room, he will get a toy. Jerome quickly
cleans his room because he wants a new art set. Let’s pause for a moment. Some people might say, “Why
should I reward my child for doing what is expected?” But in fact we are constantly and consistently rewarded
in our lives. Our paychecks are rewards, as are high grades and acceptance into our preferred school. Being
praised for doing a good job and for passing a driver’s test is also a reward. Positive reinforcement as a
learning tool is extremely effective. It has been found that one of the most effective ways to increase
achievement in school districts with below-average reading scores was to pay the children to read. Specifically,
second-grade students in Dallas were paid $2 each time they read a book and passed a short quiz about the
book. The result was a significant increase in reading comprehension (Fryer, 2010). What do you think about
this program? If Skinner were alive today, he would probably think this was a great idea. He was a strong
proponent of using operant conditioning principles to influence students’ behavior at school. In fact, in
addition to the Skinner box, he also invented what he called a teaching machine that was designed to reward
small steps in learning (Skinner, 1961)—an early forerunner of computer-assisted learning. His teaching
machine tested students’ knowledge as they worked through various school subjects. If students answered
questions correctly, they received immediate positive reinforcement and could continue; if they answered
incorrectly, they did not receive any reinforcement. The idea was that students would spend additional time
studying the material to increase their chance of being reinforced the next time (Skinner, 1961).
In negative reinforcement, an undesirable stimulus is removed to increase a behavior. For example, car
manufacturers use the principles of negative reinforcement in their seatbelt systems, which go “beep, beep,
beep” until you fasten your seatbelt. The annoying sound stops when you exhibit the desired behavior,

increasing the likelihood that you will buckle up in the future. Negative reinforcement is also used frequently
in horse training. Riders apply pressure—by pulling the reins or squeezing their legs—and then remove the
pressure when the horse performs the desired behavior, such as turning or speeding up. The pressure is the
negative stimulus that the horse wants to remove.
Punishment
Many people confuse negative reinforcement with punishment in operant conditioning, but they are two very
different mechanisms. Remember that reinforcement, even when it is negative, always increases a behavior. In
contrast, punishment always decreases a behavior. In positive punishment, you add an undesirable stimulus
to decrease a behavior. An example of positive punishment is scolding a student to get the student to stop
texting in class. In this case, a stimulus (the reprimand) is added in order to decrease the behavior (texting in
class). In negative punishment, you remove a pleasant stimulus to decrease behavior. For example, when a
child misbehaves, a parent can take away a favorite toy. In this case, a stimulus (the toy) is removed in order to
decrease the behavior.
Punishment, especially when it is immediate, is one way to decrease undesirable behavior. For example,
imagine your four-year-old son, Brandon, hit his younger brother. You have Brandon write 100 times “I will not
hit my brother"" (positive punishment). Chances are he won’t repeat this behavior. While strategies like this are
common today, in the past children were often subject to physical punishment, such as spanking. It’s
important to be aware of some of the drawbacks in using physical punishment on children. First, punishment
may teach fear. Brandon may become fearful of the street, but he also may become fearful of the person who
delivered the punishment—you, his parent. Similarly, children who are punished by teachers may come to fear
the teacher and try to avoid school (Gershoff et al., 2010). Consequently, most schools in the United States have
banned corporal punishment. Second, punishment may cause children to become more aggressive and prone
to antisocial behavior and delinquency (Gershoff, 2002). They see their parents resort to spanking when they
become angry and frustrated, so, in turn, they may act out this same behavior when they become angry and
frustrated. For example, because you spank Brenda when you are angry with her for her misbehavior, she
might start hitting her friends when they won’t share their toys.
While positive punishment can be effective in some cases, Skinner suggested that the use of punishment
should be weighed against the possible negative effects. Today’s psychologists and parenting experts favor
reinforcement over punishment—they recommend that you catch your child doing something good and reward
them for it.
Shaping
In his operant conditioning experiments, Skinner often used an approach called shaping. Instead of rewarding
only the target behavior, in shaping, we reward successive approximations of a target behavior. Why is shaping
needed? Remember that in order for reinforcement to work, the organism must first display the behavior.
Shaping is needed because it is extremely unlikely that an organism will display anything but the simplest of
behaviors spontaneously. In shaping, behaviors are broken down into many small, achievable steps. The
specific steps used in the process are the following:
1. Reinforce any response that resembles the desired behavior.
2. Then reinforce the response that more closely resembles the desired behavior. You will no longer reinforce
the previously reinforced response.
3. Next, begin to reinforce the response that even more closely resembles the desired behavior.
4. Continue to reinforce closer and closer approximations of the desired behavior.
5. Finally, only reinforce the desired behavior.
Shaping is often used in teaching a complex behavior or chain of behaviors. Skinner used shaping to teach
pigeons not only such relatively simple behaviors as pecking a disk in a Skinner box, but also many unusual
and entertaining behaviors, such as turning in circles, walking in figure eights, and even playing ping pong; the

been a prosocial model in your life?
The antisocial effects of observational learning are also worth mentioning. As you saw from the example of
Claire at the beginning of this section, her daughter viewed Claire’s aggressive behavior and copied it.
Research suggests that this may help to explain why victims of abuse often grow up to be abusers themselves
(Murrell, Christoff, & Henning, 2007). In fact, about 30% of child abuse victims become abusive parents (U.S.
Department of Health & Human Services, 2013). We tend to do what we know. Children who grow up
witnessing their parents deal with anger and frustration through violent and aggressive acts often learn to
behave in that manner themselves.
Some studies suggest that violent television shows, movies, and video games may also have antisocial effects
(Figure 6.18) although further research needs to be done to understand the correlational and causational
aspects of media violence and behavior. Some studies have found a link between viewing violence and
aggression seen in children (Anderson & Gentile, 2008; Kirsch, 2010; Miller, Grabell, Thomas, Bermann, &
Graham-Bermann, 2012). These findings may not be surprising, given that a child graduating from high school
has been exposed to around 200,000 violent acts including murder, robbery, torture, bombings, beatings, and
rape through various forms of media (Huston et al., 1992). Not only might viewing media violence affect
aggressive behavior by teaching people to act that way in real life situations, but it has also been suggested that
repeated exposure to violent acts also desensitizes people to it. Psychologists are working to understand this
dynamic.

Violent Media and Aggression
Does watching violent media or playing violent video games cause aggression? Albert Bandura's early studies
suggested television violence increased aggression in children, and more recent studies support these findings.
For example, research by Craig Anderson and colleagues (Anderson, Bushman, Donnerstein, Hummer, &
Warburton, 2015; Anderson et al., 2010; Bushman et al., 2016) found extensive evidence to suggest a causal
link between hours of exposure to violent media and aggressive thoughts and behaviors. However, studies by
Christopher Ferguson and others suggests that while there may be a link between violent media exposure and
aggression, research to date has not accounted for other risk factors for aggression including mental health and
family life (Ferguson, 2011; Gentile, 2016). What do think?

Summary
6.1 What Is Learning?
Instincts and reflexes are innate behaviors—they occur naturally and do not involve learning. In contrast,
learning is a change in behavior or knowledge that results from experience. There are three main types of
learning: classical conditioning, operant conditioning, and observational learning. Both classical and operant
conditioning are forms of associative learning where associations are made between events that occur
together. Observational learning is just as it sounds: learning by observing others.
6.2 Classical Conditioning
Pavlov’s pioneering work with dogs contributed greatly to what we know about learning. His experiments
explored the type of associative learning we now call classical conditioning. In classical conditioning,
organisms learn to associate events that repeatedly happen together, and researchers study how a reflexive
response to a stimulus can be mapped to a different stimulus—by training an association between the two
stimuli. Pavlov’s experiments show how stimulus-response bonds are formed. Watson, the founder of
behaviorism, was greatly influenced by Pavlov’s work. He tested humans by conditioning fear in an infant
known as Little Albert. His findings suggest that classical conditioning can explain how some fears develop.
6.3 Operant Conditioning
Operant conditioning is based on the work of B. F. Skinner. Operant conditioning is a form of learning in which
the motivation for a behavior happens after the behavior is demonstrated. An animal or a human receives a
consequence after performing a specific behavior. The consequence is either a reinforcer or a punisher. All
reinforcement (positive or negative) increases the likelihood of a behavioral response. All punishment
(positive or negative) decreases the likelihood of a behavioral response. Several types of reinforcement
schedules are used to reward behavior depending on either a set or variable period of time.
6.4 Observational Learning (Modeling)
According to Bandura, learning can occur by watching others and then modeling what they do or say. This is
known as observational learning. There are specific steps in the process of modeling that must be followed if
learning is to be successful. These steps include attention, retention, reproduction, and motivation. Through
modeling, Bandura has shown that children learn many things both good and bad simply by watching their
parents, siblings, and others.

7.6 The Source of Intelligence
What is the best way to solve a problem? How does a person who has never seen or touched
snow in real life develop an understanding of the concept of snow? How do young children acquire the ability
to learn language with no formal instruction? Psychologists who study thinking explore questions like these
and are called cognitive psychologists.
Cognitive psychologists also study intelligence. What is intelligence, and how does it vary from person to
person? Are “street smarts” a kind of intelligence, and if so, how do they relate to other types of intelligence?
What does an IQ test really measure? These questions and more will be explored in this chapter as you study
thinking and intelligence.
In other chapters, we discussed the cognitive processes of perception, learning, and memory. In this chapter,
we will focus on high-level cognitive processes. As a part of this discussion, we will consider thinking and
briefly explore the development and use of language. We will also discuss problem solving and creativity
before ending with a discussion of how intelligence is measured and how our biology and environments
interact to affect intelligence. After finishing this chapter, you will have a greater appreciation of the higher-
level cognitive processes that contribute to our distinctiveness as a species.

","Answer VERY concisely from the provided context only. Your answer length: less or equal 150 tokens. Plain text, no Markdown. Answer only, no other questions. Context: FIGURE 6.8 John B. Watson used the principles of classical conditioning in the study of human emotion. Watson’s ideas were influenced by Pavlov’s work. According to Watson, human behavior, just like animal behavior, is primarily the result of conditioned responses. Whereas Pavlov’s work with dogs involved the conditioning of reflexes, Watson believed the same principles could be extended to the conditioning of human emotions (Watson, 1919). In 1920, while chair of the psychology department at Johns Hopkins University, Watson and his graduate student, Rosalie Rayner, conducted research on a baby nicknamed Little Albert. Rayner and Watson’s experiments with Little Albert demonstrated how fears can be conditioned using classical conditioning. Through these experiments, Little Albert was exposed to and conditioned to fear certain things. Initially he was presented with various neutral stimuli, including a rabbit, a dog, a monkey, masks, cotton wool, and a white rat. He was not afraid of any of these things. Then Watson, with the help of Rayner, conditioned Little Albert to associate these stimuli with an emotion—fear. For example, Watson handed Little Albert the white rat, and Little Albert enjoyed playing with it. Then Watson made a loud sound, by striking a hammer against a metal bar hanging behind Little Albert’s head, each time Little Albert touched the rat. Little Albert was frightened by the sound—demonstrating a reflexive fear of sudden loud noises—and began to cry. Watson repeatedly paired the loud sound with the white rat. Soon Little Albert became frightened by the white rat alone. In this case, what are the UCS, CS, UCR, and CR? Days later, Little Albert demonstrated stimulus generalization—he became afraid of other furry things: a rabbit, a furry coat, and even a Santa Claus mask (Figure 6.9). Watson had succeeded in conditioning a fear response in Little Albert, thus demonstrating that emotions could become conditioned responses. It had been Watson’s intention to produce a phobia—a persistent, excessive fear of a specific object or situation— through conditioning alone, thus countering Freud’s view that phobias are caused by deep, hidden conflicts in the unconscious mind. However, his experiments showed that fear could also be caused by a conditioned response to a neutral stimulus, such as a sound or a mask. This was the first experiment to show that conditioning could produce fear responses in humans. (For more information, see Chapter 7, “Classical Conditioning,” and Chapter 8, ""Conditioned Reflexes.”) Answer: The UCS is the conditioned stimulus (CS), and the CS is a stimulus that elicits a response (UCR). The CR is the response that is elicited (CR). In other words, UCS = CS = CR. Question: What did Watson use to study human emotions? Answer: Classical conditioning Question: How did he conduct the experiments? What were the results of his research? (Hint: Use the text to answer this question.) Answer: Watsons experiments were conducted using the principle of conditioning, which is based on the idea that certain stimuli can become associated with certain emotions or behaviors. The experiments involved exposing Little Albert to various stimuli and conditioning him to associate them with a specific emotion. Specifically, he was presented with different types of stimuli (e.g., rabbits, dogs, monkeys, etc.) and was then conditioned to associate each stimulus with fear. Over time, the association between the stimulus and fear became stronger and more pronounced, demonstrating the effectiveness of this conditioning technique in producing fear responses. As a result, it was Watson's intention that humans could learn to respond to certain stimuli with fear, thereby counteracting the influence of Freud's psychoanalytic theory that suggested deep unconscious conflicts were at the root of many psychological disorders.

5,"LINK T O LEARNING
Watch this video about how babies lose the ability to discriminate among all possible human phonemes as they
age (http://openstax.org/l/language) to learn more.
After the first few months of life, babies enter what is known as the babbling stage, during which time they tend
to produce single syllables that are repeated over and over. As time passes, more variations appear in the
syllables that they produce. During this time, it is unlikely that the babies are trying to communicate; they are
just as likely to babble when they are alone as when they are with their caregivers (Fernández & Cairns, 2011).
Interestingly, babies who are raised in environments in which sign language is used will also begin to show
babbling in the gestures of their hands during this stage (Petitto, Holowka, Sergio, Levy, & Ostry, 2004).
Generally, a child’s first word is uttered sometime between the ages of 1 year to 18 months, and for the next few
months, the child will remain in the “one word” stage of language development. During this time, children
know a number of words, but they only produce one-word utterances. The child’s early vocabulary is limited to
familiar objects or events, often nouns. Although children in this stage only make one-word utterances, these
words often carry larger meaning (Fernández & Cairns, 2011). So, for example, a child saying “cookie” could be
identifying a cookie or asking for a cookie.
As a child’s lexicon grows, they begin to utter simple sentences and to acquire new vocabulary at a very rapid
pace. In addition, children begin to demonstrate a clear understanding of the specific rules that apply to their
language(s). Even the mistakes that children sometimes make provide evidence of just how much they
understand about those rules. This is sometimes seen in the form of overgeneralization. In this context,
overgeneralization refers to an extension of a language rule to an exception to the rule. For example, in
English, it is usually the case that an “s” is added to the end of a word to indicate plurality. For example, we
speak of one dog versus two dogs. Young children will overgeneralize this rule to cases that are exceptions to
the “add an s to the end of the word” rule and say things like “those two gooses” or “three mouses.” Clearly, the
rules of the language are understood, even if the exceptions to the rules are still being learned (Moskowitz,
1978).
Language and Thought
When we speak one language, we agree that words are representations of ideas, people, places, and events. The
given language that children learn is connected to their culture and surroundings. But can words themselves
shape the way we think about things? Psychologists have long investigated the question of whether language
shapes thoughts and actions, or whether our thoughts and beliefs shape our language. Two researchers,
Edward Sapir and Benjamin Lee Whorf, began this investigation in the 1940s. They wanted to understand how
the language habits of a community encourage members of that community to interpret language in a
particular manner (Sapir, 1941/1964). Sapir and Whorf proposed that language determines thought. For
example, in some languages there are many different words for love. However, in English we use the word love
for all types of love. Does this affect how we think about love depending on the language that we speak (Whorf,
1956)? Researchers have since identified this view as too absolute, pointing out a lack of empiricism behind
what Sapir and Whorf proposed (Abler, 2013; Boroditsky, 2011; van Troyer, 1994). Today, psychologists
continue to study and debate the relationship between language and thought.
The Meaning of Language
Think about what you know of other languages; perhaps you even speak multiple languages. Imagine for a
moment that your closest friend fluently speaks more than one language. Do you think that friend thinks
differently, depending on which language is being spoken? You may know a few words that are not translatable

from their original language into English. For example, the Portuguese word saudade originated during the 15th
century, when Portuguese sailors left home to explore the seas and travel to Africa or Asia. Those left behind
described the emptiness and fondness they felt as saudade (Figure 7.6). The word came to express many
meanings, including loss, nostalgia, yearning, warm memories, and hope. There is no single word in English that
includes all of those emotions in a single description. Do words such as saudade indicate that different languages
produce different patterns of thought in people? What do you think??
FIGURE 7.6 These two works of art depict saudade. (a) Saudade de Nápoles, which is translated into “missing
Naples,” was painted by Bertha Worms in 1895. (b) Almeida Júnior painted Saudade in 1899.
Language may indeed influence the way that we think, an idea known as linguistic determinism. One recent
demonstration of this phenomenon involved differences in the way that English and Mandarin Chinese
speakers talk and think about time. English speakers tend to talk about time using terms that describe
changes along a horizontal dimension, for example, saying something like “I’m running behind schedule” or
“Don’t get ahead of yourself.” While Mandarin Chinese speakers also describe time in horizontal terms, it is not
uncommon to also use terms associated with a vertical arrangement. For example, the past might be described
as being “up” and the future as being “down.” It turns out that these differences in language translate into
differences in performance on cognitive tests designed to measure how quickly an individual can recognize
temporal relationships. Specifically, when given a series of tasks with vertical priming, Mandarin Chinese
speakers were faster at recognizing temporal relationships between months. Indeed, Boroditsky (2001) sees
these results as suggesting that “habits in language encourage habits in thought” (p. 12).
One group of researchers who wanted to investigate how language influences thought compared how English
speakers and the Dani people of Papua New Guinea think and speak about color. The Dani have two words for
color: one word for light and one word for dark. In contrast, the English language has 11 color words.
Researchers hypothesized that the number of color terms could limit the ways that the Dani people
conceptualized color. However, the Dani were able to distinguish colors with the same ability as English
speakers, despite having fewer words at their disposal (Berlin & Kay, 1969). A recent review of research aimed
at determining how language might affect something like color perception suggests that language can
influence perceptual phenomena, especially in the left hemisphere of the brain. You may recall from earlier
chapters that the left hemisphere is associated with language for most people. However, the right (less
7.2 • Language 221
linguistic hemisphere) of the brain is less affected by linguistic influences on perception (Regier & Kay, 2009)
7.3 Problem Solving
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe problem solving strategies
• Define algorithm and heuristic
• Explain some common roadblocks to effective problem solving and decision making
People face problems every day—usually, multiple problems throughout the day. Sometimes these problems
are straightforward: To double a recipe for pizza dough, for example, all that is required is that each ingredient
in the recipe be doubled. Sometimes, however, the problems we encounter are more complex. For example,
say you have a work deadline, and you must mail a printed copy of a report to your supervisor by the end of the
business day. The report is time-sensitive and must be sent overnight. You finished the report last night, but
your printer will not work today. What should you do? First, you need to identify the problem and then apply a
strategy for solving the problem.
Problem-Solving Strategies
When you are presented with a problem—whether it is a complex mathematical problem or a broken printer,
how do you solve it? Before finding a solution to the problem, the problem must first be clearly identified. After
that, one of many problem solving strategies can be applied, hopefully resulting in a solution.
A problem-solving strategy is a plan of action used to find a solution. Different strategies have different action
plans associated with them (Table 7.2). For example, a well-known strategy is trial and error. The old adage,
“If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again” describes trial and error. In terms of your broken printer, you could
try checking the ink levels, and if that doesn’t work, you could check to make sure the paper tray isn’t jammed.
Or maybe the printer isn’t actually connected to your laptop. When using trial and error, you would continue to
try different solutions until you solved your problem. Although trial and error is not typically one of the most
time-efficient strategies, it is a commonly used one.

Heuristic General problem-solving

TABLE 7.2
Another type of strategy is an algorithm. An algorithm is a problem-solving formula that provides you with
step-by-step instructions used to achieve a desired outcome (Kahneman, 2011). You can think of an algorithm
as a recipe with highly detailed instructions that produce the same result every time they are performed.
Algorithms are used frequently in our everyday lives, especially in computer science. When you run a search
on the Internet, search engines like Google use algorithms to decide which entries will appear first in your list
of results. Facebook also uses algorithms to decide which posts to display on your newsfeed. Can you identify
other situations in which algorithms are used?
222 7 • Thinking and Intelligence

A heuristic is another type of problem solving strategy. While an algorithm must be followed exactly to produce
a correct result, a heuristic is a general problem-solving framework (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). You can
think of these as mental shortcuts that are used to solve problems. A “rule of thumb” is an example of a
heuristic. Such a rule saves the person time and energy when making a decision, but despite its time-saving
characteristics, it is not always the best method for making a rational decision. Different types of heuristics are
used in different types of situations, but the impulse to use a heuristic occurs when one of five conditions is
met (Pratkanis, 1989):
• When one is faced with too much information
• When the time to make a decision is limited
• When the decision to be made is unimportant
• When there is access to very little information to use in making the decision
• When an appropriate heuristic happens to come to mind in the same moment
Working backwards is a useful heuristic in which you begin solving the problem by focusing on the end
result. Consider this example: You live in Washington, D.C. and have been invited to a wedding at 4 PM on
Saturday in Philadelphia. Knowing that Interstate 95 tends to back up any day of the week, you need to plan
your route and time your departure accordingly. If you want to be at the wedding service by 3:30 PM, and it
takes 2.5 hours to get to Philadelphia without traffic, what time should you leave your house? You use the
working backwards heuristic to plan the events of your day on a regular basis, probably without even thinking
about it.
Another useful heuristic is the practice of accomplishing a large goal or task by breaking it into a series of
smaller steps. Students often use this common method to complete a large research project or long essay for
school. For example, students typically brainstorm, develop a thesis or main topic, research the chosen topic,
organize their information into an outline, write a rough draft, revise and edit the rough draft, develop a final
draft, organize the references list, and proofread their work before turning in the project. The large task
becomes less overwhelming when it is broken down into a series of small steps.
Solving Puzzles
Problem-solving abilities can improve with practice. Many people challenge themselves every day with puzzles
and other mental exercises to sharpen their problem-solving skills. Sudoku puzzles appear daily in most
newspapers. Typically, a sudoku puzzle is a 9×9 grid. The simple sudoku below (Figure 7.7) is a 4×4 grid. To solve
the puzzle, fill in the empty boxes with a single digit: 1, 2, 3, or 4. Here are the rules: The numbers must total 10
in each bolded box, each row, and each column; however, each digit can only appear once in a bolded box, row,
and column. Time yourself as you solve this puzzle and compare your time with a classmate.

Pitfalls to Problem Solving
Not all problems are successfully solved, however. What challenges stop us from successfully solving a
problem? Imagine a person in a room that has four doorways. One doorway that has always been open in the
past is now locked. The person, accustomed to exiting the room by that particular doorway, keeps trying to get
out through the same doorway even though the other three doorways are open. The person is stuck—but they
just need to go to another doorway, instead of trying to get out through the locked doorway. A mental set is
where you persist in approaching a problem in a way that has worked in the past but is clearly not working
now.
Functional fixedness is a type of mental set where you cannot perceive an object being used for something
other than what it was designed for. Duncker (1945) conducted foundational research on functional fixedness.
He created an experiment in which participants were given a candle, a book of matches, and a box of
thumbtacks. They were instructed to use those items to attach the candle to the wall so that it did not drip wax
onto the table below. Participants had to use functional fixedness to overcome the problem (Figure 7.10).
During the Apollo 13 mission to the moon, NASA engineers at Mission Control had to overcome functional
fixedness to save the lives of the astronauts aboard the spacecraft. An explosion in a module of the spacecraft
damaged multiple systems. The astronauts were in danger of being poisoned by rising levels of carbon dioxide
because of problems with the carbon dioxide filters. The engineers found a way for the astronauts to use spare
plastic bags, tape, and air hoses to create a makeshift air filter, which saved the lives of the astronauts.

intelligence are at the core of his conclusions.
In a related story, parents of African American students filed a case against the State of California in 1979,
because they believed that the testing method used to identify students with learning disabilities was
culturally unfair as the tests were normed and standardized using White children (Larry P. v. Riles). The testing
method used by the state disproportionately identified African American children as “mentally retarded,""
which resulted in many students being incorrectly classified. According to a summary of the case, Larry P. v.
Riles:
In violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Education
for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, defendants have utilized standardized intelligence tests
that are racially and culturally biased, have a discriminatory impact against Black children, and have
not been validated for the purpose of essentially permanent placements of Black children into
educationally dead-end, isolated, and stigmatizing classes for the so-called educable mentally
retarded. Further, these federal laws have been violated by defendants' general use of placement
mechanisms that, taken together, have not been validated and result in a large over-representation of
Black children in the special E.M.R. classes. (Larry P. v. Riles, par. 6)
Once again, the limitations of intelligence testing were revealed.
What are Learning Disabilities?
Learning disabilities are cognitive disorders that affect different areas of cognition, particularly language or
reading. It should be pointed out that learning disabilities are not the same thing as intellectual disabilities.
Learning disabilities are considered specific neurological impairments rather than global intellectual or
developmental disabilities. A person with a language disability has difficulty understanding or using spoken
language, whereas someone with a reading disability, such as dyslexia, has difficulty processing what they are
reading.
Often, learning disabilities are not recognized until a child reaches school age. One confounding aspect of
learning disabilities is that they most often affect children with average to above-average intelligence. In other
words, the disability is specific to a particular area and not a measure of overall intellectual ability. At the same
time, learning disabilities tend to exhibit comorbidity with other disorders, like attention-deficit hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD). Anywhere between 30–70% of individuals with diagnosed cases of ADHD also have some sort
of learning disability (Riccio, Gonzales, & Hynd, 1994). Let’s take a look at three examples of common learning
disabilities: dysgraphia, dyslexia, and dyscalculia.
Dysgraphia
Children with dysgraphia have a learning disability that results in a struggle to write legibly. The physical task
of writing with a pen and paper is extremely challenging for the person. These children often have extreme
difficulty putting their thoughts down on paper (Smits-Engelsman & Van Galen, 1997). This difficulty is
inconsistent with a person’s IQ. That is, based on the child’s IQ and/or abilities in other areas, a child with
dysgraphia should be able to write, but can’t. Children with dysgraphia may also have problems with spatial
abilities.
Students with dysgraphia need academic accommodations to help them succeed in school. These
accommodations can provide students with alternative assessment opportunities to demonstrate what they
know (Barton, 2003). For example, a student with dysgraphia might be permitted to take an oral exam rather
than a traditional paper-and-pencil test. Treatment is usually provided by an occupational therapist, although
there is some question as to how effective such treatment is (Zwicker, 2005).
Dyslexia
Dyslexia is the most common learning disability in children. An individual with dyslexia exhibits an inability
to correctly process letters. The neurological mechanism for sound processing does not work properly in
7.6 • The Source of Intelligence 239
someone with dyslexia. As a result, dyslexic children may not understand sound-letter correspondence. A
child with dyslexia may mix up letters within words and sentences—letter reversals, such as those shown in
Figure 7.17, are a hallmark of this learning disability—or skip whole words while reading. A dyslexic child may
have difficulty spelling words correctly while writing. Because of the disordered way that the brain processes
letters and sound, learning to read is a frustrating experience. Some dyslexic individuals cope by memorizing
the shapes of most words, but they never actually learn to read (Berninger, 2008).
FIGURE 7.17 These written words show variations of the word “teapot” as written by individuals with dyslexia.
Dyscalculia
Dyscalculia is difficulty in learning or comprehending arithmetic. This learning disability is often first evident
when children exhibit difficulty discerning how many objects are in a small group without counting them.
Other symptoms may include struggling to memorize math facts, organize numbers, or fully differentiate
between numerals, math symbols, and written numbers (such as “3” and “three”).

Summary
7.1 What Is Cognition?
In this section, you were introduced to cognitive psychology, which is the study of cognition, or the brain’s
ability to think, perceive, plan, analyze, and remember. Concepts and their corresponding prototypes help us
quickly organize our thinking by creating categories into which we can sort new information. We also develop
schemata, which are clusters of related concepts. Some schemata involve routines of thought and behavior,
and these help us function properly in various situations without having to “think twice” about them.
Schemata show up in social situations and routines of daily behavior.
7.2 Language
Language is a communication system that has both a lexicon and a system of grammar. Language acquisition
occurs naturally and effortlessly during the early stages of life, and this acquisition occurs in a predictable
sequence for individuals around the world. Language has a strong influence on thought, and the concept of
how language may influence cognition remains an area of study and debate in psychology.
7.3 Problem Solving
Many different strategies exist for solving problems. Typical strategies include trial and error, applying
algorithms, and using heuristics. To solve a large, complicated problem, it often helps to break the problem
into smaller steps that can be accomplished individually, leading to an overall solution. Roadblocks to problem
solving include a mental set, functional fixedness, and various biases that can cloud decision making skills.
7.4 What Are Intelligence and Creativity?
Intelligence is a complex characteristic of cognition. Many theories have been developed to explain what
intelligence is and how it works. Sternberg generated his triarchic theory of intelligence, whereas Gardner
posits that intelligence is comprised of many factors. Still others focus on the importance of emotional
intelligence. Finally, creativity seems to be a facet of intelligence, but it is extremely difficult to measure
objectively.
7.5 Measures of Intelligence
In this section, we learned about the history of intelligence testing and some of the challenges regarding
intelligence testing. Intelligence tests began in earnest with Binet; Wechsler later developed intelligence tests
that are still in use today: the WAIS-IV and WISC-V. The Bell curve shows the range of scores that encompass

7.6 The Source of Intelligence
Genetics and environment affect intelligence and the challenges of certain learning disabilities. The
intelligence levels of all individuals seem to benefit from rich stimulation in their early environments. Highly
intelligent individuals, however, may have a built-in resiliency that allows them to overcome difficult obstacles
in their upbringing. Learning disabilities can cause major challenges for children who are learning to read and
write. Unlike developmental disabilities, learning disabilities are strictly neurological in nature and are not
related to intelligence levels. Students with dyslexia, for example, may have extreme difficulty learning to read,
but their intelligence levels are typically average or above average.

Context: LINK T O LEARNING Watch this video about how babies lose the ability to discriminate among all possible human phonemes as they age (http://openstax.org/l/language) to learn more. After the first few months of life, babies enter what is known as the babbling stage, during which time they tend to produce single syllables that are repeated over and over. As time passes, more variations appear in the syllables that they produce. During this time, it is unlikely that the babies are trying to communicate; they are just as likely to babble when they are alone as when they are with their caregivers (Fernández & Cairns, 2011). Interestingly, babies who are raised in environments in which sign language is used will also begin to show babbling in the gestures of their hands during this stage (Petitto, Holowka, Sergio, Levy, & Ostry, 2004). Generally, a child’s first word is uttered sometime between the ages of 1 year to 18 months, and for the next few months, the child will remain in the “one word” stage of language development. During this time, children know a number of words, but they only produce one-word utterances. The child’s early vocabulary is limited to familiar objects or events, often nouns. Although children in this stage only make one-word utterances, these words often carry larger meaning (Fernández & Cairns, 2011). So, for example, a child saying “cookie” could be identifying a cookie or asking for a cookie. As a child’s lexicon grows, they begin to utter simple sentences and to acquire new vocabulary at a very rapid pace. In addition, children begin to demonstrate a clear understanding of the specific rules that apply to their language(s). Even the mistakes that children sometimes make provide evidence of just how much they understand about those rules. This is sometimes seen in the form of overgeneralization. In this context, overgeneralization refers to an extension of a language rule to an exception to the rule. For example, in English, it is usually the case that an “s” is added to the end of a word to indicate plurality. However, if a child is given the word “apple” and is asked to say “apples,” he or she will probably respond with “pears” or “peach” instead of “aples.” In fact, this is a common mistake that many children make. It is important to note, however, that this type of error is not necessarily a sign of lack of understanding. Rather, what it indicates is that the children have not yet learned the rules governing the use of plural and singular forms. In addition to learning new words and using new forms of speech, young children are also learning how to use their spoken language in a variety of contexts. They are learning to respond to questions, to answer questions, and to express their own thoughts and feelings. These are all important skills that will serve them well throughout their lives. Children who have a strong grasp of these skills will be better able to understand and communicate with others, as well as be more successful in school and in their personal relationships with other people. At the age of three or four years of age, most children will have mastered the basic rules of grammar and will be ready to begin speaking in sentences. By the time children reach the fourth grade, many of them have learned to speak in complete sentences that include a subject and a predicate. At this point, their vocabulary will have grown to a point where they can use a wide range of adjectives and adverbs to describe the things they see, hear, or experience. Most importantly, however, at this age they have begun to develop an understanding of how language works and how it can be used to convey meaning and express ideas.

6,"between 73 and 79 years old (Singh & Siahpush, 2006), we can expect to spend approximately 25 years of our
lives sleeping. Some animals never sleep (e.g., some fish and amphibian species); other animals sleep very
little without apparent negative consequences (e.g., giraffes); yet some animals (e.g., rats) die after two weeks
of sleep deprivation (Siegel, 2008). Why do we devote so much time to sleeping? Is it absolutely essential that
we sleep? This section will consider these questions and explore various explanations for why we sleep.
What is Sleep?
You have read that sleep is distinguished by low levels of physical activity and reduced sensory awareness. As
discussed by Siegel (2008), a definition of sleep must also include mention of the interplay of the circadian and
homeostatic mechanisms that regulate sleep. Homeostatic regulation of sleep is evidenced by sleep rebound
following sleep deprivation. Sleep rebound refers to the fact that a sleep-deprived individual will fall asleep
more quickly during subsequent opportunities for sleep. Sleep is characterized by certain patterns of activity
of the brain that can be visualized using electroencephalography (EEG), and different phases of sleep can be
differentiated using EEG as well.
Sleep-wake cycles seem to be controlled by multiple brain areas acting in conjunction with one another. Some
of these areas include the thalamus, the hypothalamus, and the pons. As already mentioned, the
hypothalamus contains the SCN—the biological clock of the body—in addition to other nuclei that, in
conjunction with the thalamus, regulate slow-wave sleep. The pons is important for regulating rapid eye
movement (REM) sleep (National Institutes of Health, n.d.).
Sleep is also associated with the secretion and regulation of a number of hormones from several endocrine
glands including: melatonin, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and growth
hormone (National Institutes of Health, n.d.). You have read that the pineal gland releases melatonin during
sleep (Figure 4.6). Melatonin is thought to be involved in the regulation of various biological rhythms and the
immune system (Hardeland et al., 2006). During sleep, the pituitary gland secretes both FSH and LH which are
important in regulating the reproductive system (Christensen et al., 2012; Sofikitis et al., 2008). The pituitary
gland also secretes growth hormone, during sleep, which plays a role in physical growth and maturation as
well as other metabolic processes (Bartke, Sun, & Longo, 2013).
FIGURE 4.6 The pineal and pituitary glands secrete a number of hormones during sleep.
Why Do We Sleep?
Given the central role that sleep plays in our lives and the number of adverse consequences that have been
associated with sleep deprivation, one would think that we would have a clear understanding of why it is that
we sleep. Unfortunately, this is not the case; however, several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the
function of sleep.
4.2 • Sleep and Why We Sleep 115
Adaptive Function of Sleep
One popular hypothesis of sleep incorporates the perspective of evolutionary psychology. Evolutionary
psychology is a discipline that studies how universal patterns of behavior and cognitive processes have
evolved over time as a result of natural selection. Variations and adaptations in cognition and behavior make
individuals more or less successful in reproducing and passing their genes to their offspring. One hypothesis
from this perspective might argue that sleep is essential to restore resources that are expended during the day.
Just as bears hibernate in the winter when resources are scarce, perhaps people sleep at night to reduce their
energy expenditures. While this is an intuitive explanation of sleep, there is little research that supports this
explanation. In fact, it has been suggested that there is no reason to think that energetic demands could not be
addressed with periods of rest and inactivity (Frank, 2006; Rial et al., 2007), and some research has actually
found a negative correlation between energetic demands and the amount of time spent sleeping (Capellini,
Barton, McNamara, Preston, & Nunn, 2008).
Another evolutionary hypothesis of sleep holds that our sleep patterns evolved as an adaptive response to
predatory risks, which increase in darkness. Thus we sleep in safe areas to reduce the chance of harm. Again,
this is an intuitive and appealing explanation for why we sleep. Perhaps our ancestors spent extended periods
of time asleep to reduce attention to themselves from potential predators. Comparative research indicates,
however, that the relationship that exists between predatory risk and sleep is very complex and equivocal.
Some research suggests that species that face higher predatory risks sleep fewer hours than other species
(Capellini et al., 2008), while other researchers suggest there is no relationship between the amount of time a
given species spends in deep sleep and its predation risk (Lesku, Roth, Amlaner, & Lima, 2006).
It is quite possible that sleep serves no single universally adaptive function, and different species have evolved
different patterns of sleep in response to their unique evolutionary pressures. While we have discussed the
negative outcomes associated with sleep deprivation, it should be pointed out that there are many benefits that
are associated with adequate amounts of sleep. A few such benefits listed by the National Sleep Foundation
(n.d.) include maintaining healthy weight, lowering stress levels, improving mood, and increasing motor
coordination, as well as a number of benefits related to cognition and memory formation.
Cognitive Function of Sleep
Another theory regarding why we sleep involves sleep’s importance for cognitive function and memory
formation (Rattenborg, Lesku, Martinez-Gonzalez, & Lima, 2007). Indeed, we know sleep deprivation results in
disruptions in cognition and memory deficits (Brown, 2012), leading to impairments in our abilities to
maintain attention, make decisions, and recall long-term memories. Moreover, these impairments become
more severe as the amount of sleep deprivation increases (Alhola & Polo-Kantola, 2007). Furthermore, slow-
wave sleep after learning a new task can improve resultant performance on that task (Huber, Ghilardi,
Massimini, & Tononi, 2004) and seems essential for effective memory formation (Stickgold, 2005).
Understanding the impact of sleep on cognitive function should help you understand that cramming all night
for a test may be not effective and can even prove counterproductive.

Getting the optimal amount of sleep has also been associated with other cognitive benefits. Research indicates
that included among these possible benefits are increased capacities for creative thinking (Cai, Mednick,
Harrison, Kanady, & Mednick, 2009; Wagner, Gais, Haider, Verleger, & Born, 2004), language learning (Fenn,
Nusbaum, & Margoliash, 2003; Gómez, Bootzin, & Nadel, 2006), and inferential judgments (Ellenbogen, Hu,
Payne, Titone, & Walker, 2007). It is possible that even the processing of emotional information is influenced by
certain aspects of sleep (Walker, 2009).

4.3 Stages of Sleep
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Differentiate between REM and non-REM sleep
• Describe the differences between the three stages of non-REM sleep
• Understand the role that REM and non-REM sleep play in learning and memory
Sleep is not a uniform state of being. Instead, sleep is composed of several different stages that can be
differentiated from one another by the patterns of brain wave activity that occur during each stage. While
awake, our brain wave activity is dominated by beta waves. As compared to the brain wave patterns while
asleep, beta waves have the highest frequency (13–30 Hz) and lowest amplitude, and they tend to show more
variability. As we begin to fall asleep, our brain wave activity changes. These changes can be visualized using
an EEG and are distinguished from one another by both the frequency and amplitude of the brain wave. The
frequency of a brain wave is how many brain waves occur in a second, and frequency is measured in Hertz
(Hz). Amplitude is the height of the brain wave (Figure 4.7). Sleep can be divided into two different general
phases: REM sleep and non-REM (NREM) sleep. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is characterized by darting
movements of the eyes under closed eyelids. Brain waves during REM sleep appear very similar to brain waves
during wakefulness. In contrast, non-REM (NREM) sleep is subdivided into three stages distinguished from
each other and from wakefulness by characteristic patterns of brain waves. The first three stages of sleep are
NREM sleep, typically followed by REM sleep. In this section, we will discuss each of these stages of sleep and
their associated patterns of brain wave activity.
FIGURE 4.7 Brainwave activity changes dramatically across the different stages of sleep. (credit ""sleeping"":
modification of work by Ryan Vaarsi)
NREM Stages of Sleep
As we begin to fall asleep, we enter NREM sleep, and brain wave patterns decrease in frequency and increase
in amplitude. The first stage of NREM sleep is known as stage 1 sleep. Stage 1 sleep is a transitional phase that
occurs between wakefulness and sleep, the period during which we drift off to sleep. During this time, there is
a slowdown in both the rates of respiration and heartbeat. In addition, stage 1 sleep involves a marked
4.3 • Stages of Sleep 117
decrease in both overall muscle tension and core body temperature.
In terms of brain wave activity, stage 1 sleep is associated with both alpha and theta waves. The early portion of
stage 1 sleep produces alpha waves. These patterns of electrical activity (waves) resemble that of someone
who is very relaxed, yet awake, but they have less variability (are more synchronized) and are relatively lower
in frequency (8–12 Hz) and higher in amplitude than beta waves (Figure 4.8). As an individual continues
through stage 1 sleep, there is an increase in theta wave activity. Theta waves are even lower frequency (4–7
Hz), and higher in amplitude, than the alpha wave patterns. It is relatively easy to wake someone from stage 1
sleep; in fact, people often report that they have not been asleep if they are awoken during stage 1 sleep.
FIGURE 4.8 Brainwave activity changes dramatically across the different stages of sleep.
As we move into stage 2 sleep, the body goes into a state of deep relaxation. Theta waves still dominate the
activity of the brain, but they are interrupted by brief bursts of activity known as sleep spindles (Figure 4.9). A
sleep spindle is a rapid burst of higher frequency brain waves that may be important for learning and memory
(Fogel & Smith, 2011; Poe, Walsh, & Bjorness, 2010). In addition, the appearance of K-complexes is often
associated with stage 2 sleep. A K-complex is a very high amplitude pattern of brain activity that may in some
cases occur in response to environmental stimuli. Thus, K-complexes might serve as a bridge to higher levels
of arousal in response to what is going on in our environments (Halász, 1993; Steriade & Amzica, 1998).
FIGURE 4.9 Stage 2 sleep is characterized by the appearance of both sleep spindles and K-complexes.
NREM stage 3 sleep is often referred to as deep sleep or slow-wave sleep because this stage is characterized by
low frequency (less than 3 Hz), high amplitude delta waves (Figure 4.10). These delta waves have the lowest
frequency and highest amplitude of our sleeping brain wave patterns. During this time, an individual’s heart
rate and respiration slow dramatically, and it is much more difficult to awaken someone from sleep during

stage 3 than during earlier stages. Interestingly, individuals who have increased levels of alpha brain wave
activity (more often associated with wakefulness and transition into stage 1 sleep) during stage 3 often report
that they do not feel refreshed upon waking, regardless of how long they slept (Stone, Taylor, McCrae, Kalsekar,
& Lichstein, 2008).
FIGURE 4.10 (a) Delta waves, which are low frequency and high amplitude, characterize (b) slow-wave stage 3 and
REM sleep.
REM Sleep
As mentioned earlier, REM sleep is marked by rapid movements of the eyes. The brain waves associated with
this stage of sleep are very similar to those observed when a person is awake, as shown in Figure 4.11, and this
is the period of sleep in which dreaming occurs. It is also associated with paralysis of muscle systems in the
body with the exception of those that make circulation and respiration possible. Therefore, no movement of
voluntary muscles occurs during REM sleep in a normal individual; REM sleep is often referred to as
paradoxical sleep because of this combination of high brain activity and lack of muscle tone. Like NREM sleep,
REM has been implicated in various aspects of learning and memory (Wagner, Gais, & Born, 2001; Siegel,
2001).
FIGURE 4.11 (a) A period of rapid eye movement is marked by the short red line segment. The brain waves
associated with REM sleep, outlined in the red box in (a), look very similar to those seen (b) during wakefulness.
If people are deprived of REM sleep and then allowed to sleep without disturbance, they will spend more time
in REM sleep in what would appear to be an effort to recoup the lost time in REM. This is known as the REM
rebound, and it suggests that REM sleep is also homeostatically regulated. Aside from the role that REM sleep
may play in processes related to learning and memory, REM sleep may also be involved in emotional

We may be top-notch learners, but if we don’t have a way to store what we’ve learned, what
good is the knowledge we’ve gained?
Take a few minutes to imagine what your day might be like if you could not remember anything you had
learned. You would have to figure out how to get dressed. What clothing should you wear, and how do buttons
and zippers work? You would need someone to teach you how to brush your teeth and tie your shoes. Who
would you ask for help with these tasks, since you wouldn’t recognize the faces of these people in your house?
Wait . . . is this even your house? Uh oh, your stomach begins to rumble and you feel hungry. You’d like
something to eat, but you don’t know where the food is kept or even how to prepare it. Oh dear, this is getting
confusing. Maybe it would be best just go back to bed. A bed . . . what is a bed?
We have an amazing capacity for memory, but how, exactly, do we process and store information? Are there
different kinds of memory, and if so, what characterizes the different types? How, exactly, do we retrieve our
memories? And why do we forget? This chapter will explore these questions as we learn about memory.

8.1 How Memory Functions
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Discuss the three basic functions of memory
• Describe the three stages of memory storage
• Describe and distinguish between procedural and declarative memory and semantic and episodic memory
Memory is an information processing system; therefore, we often compare it to a computer. Memory is the set
of processes used to encode, store, and retrieve information over different periods of time (Figure 8.2).
FIGURE 8.2 Encoding involves the input of information into the memory system. Storage is the retention of the
encoded information. Retrieval, or getting the information out of memory and back into awareness, is the third
function.
LINK T O LEARNING
Watch this video about the neuroscience of memory (http://openstax.org/l/unexpectfact) to learn more.
Encoding
We get information into our brains through a process called encoding, which is the input of information into
the memory system. Once we receive sensory information from the environment, our brains label or code it.
We organize the information with other similar information and connect new concepts to existing concepts.
Encoding information occurs through automatic processing and effortful processing.
If someone asks you what you ate for lunch today, more than likely you could recall this information quite
easily. This is known as automatic processing, or the encoding of details like time, space, frequency, and the
meaning of words. Automatic processing is usually done without any conscious awareness. Recalling the last
time you studied for a test is another example of automatic processing. But what about the actual test material
you studied? It probably required a lot of work and attention on your part in order to encode that information.
This is known as effortful processing (Figure 8.3).
FIGURE 8.3 When you first learn new skills such as driving a car, you have to put forth effort and attention to
encode information about how to start a car, how to brake, how to handle a turn, and so on. Once you know how to
drive, you can encode additional information about this skill automatically. (credit: Robert Couse-Baker)
What are the most effective ways to ensure that important memories are well encoded? Even a simple
sentence is easier to recall when it is meaningful (Anderson, 1984). Read the following sentences (Bransford &
248 8 • Memory

McCarrell, 1974), then look away and count backwards from 30 by threes to zero, and then try to write down
the sentences (no peeking back at this page!).
1. The notes were sour because the seams split.
2. The voyage wasn't delayed because the bottle shattered.
3. The haystack was important because the cloth ripped.
How well did you do? By themselves, the statements that you wrote down were most likely confusing and
difficult for you to recall. Now, try writing them again, using the following prompts: bagpipe, ship christening,
and parachutist. Next count backwards from 40 by fours, then check yourself to see how well you recalled the
sentences this time. You can see that the sentences are now much more memorable because each of the
sentences was placed in context. Material is far better encoded when you make it meaningful.
There are three types of encoding. The encoding of words and their meaning is known as semantic encoding.
It was first demonstrated by William Bousfield (1935) in an experiment in which he asked people to memorize
words. The 60 words were actually divided into 4 categories of meaning, although the participants did not
know this because the words were randomly presented. When they were asked to remember the words, they
tended to recall them in categories, showing that they paid attention to the meanings of the words as they
learned them.
Visual encoding is the encoding of images, and acoustic encoding is the encoding of sounds, words in
particular. To see how visual encoding works, read over this list of words: car, level, dog, truth, book, value. If
you were asked later to recall the words from this list, which ones do you think you’d most likely remember?
You would probably have an easier time recalling the words car, dog, and book, and a more difficult time
recalling the words level, truth, and value. Why is this? Because you can recall images (mental pictures) more
easily than words alone. When you read the words car, dog, and book you created images of these things in
your mind. These are concrete, high-imagery words. On the other hand, abstract words like level, truth, and
value are low-imagery words. High-imagery words are encoded both visually and semantically (Paivio, 1986),
thus building a stronger memory.
Now let’s turn our attention to acoustic encoding. You are driving in your car and a song comes on the radio
that you haven’t heard in at least 10 years, but you sing along, recalling every word. In the United States,
children often learn the alphabet through song, and they learn the number of days in each month through
rhyme: “Thirty days hath September, / April, June, and November; / All the rest have thirty-one, / Save
February, with twenty-eight days clear, / And twenty-nine each leap year.” These lessons are easy to remember
because of acoustic encoding. We encode the sounds the words make. This is one of the reasons why much of
what we teach young children is done through song, rhyme, and rhythm.
Which of the three types of encoding do you think would give you the best memory of verbal information?
Some years ago, psychologists Fergus Craik and Endel Tulving (1975) conducted a series of experiments to
find out. Participants were given words along with questions about them. The questions required the
participants to process the words at one of the three levels. The visual processing questions included such
things as asking the participants about the font of the letters. The acoustic processing questions asked the
participants about the sound or rhyming of the words, and the semantic processing questions asked the
participants about the meaning of the words. After participants were presented with the words and questions,
they were given an unexpected recall or recognition task.
Words that had been encoded semantically were better remembered than those encoded visually or
acoustically. Semantic encoding involves a deeper level of processing than the shallower visual or acoustic
encoding. Craik and Tulving concluded that we process verbal information best through semantic encoding,
especially if we apply what is called the self-reference effect. The self-reference effect is the tendency for an
individual to have better memory for information that relates to oneself in comparison to material that has less
personal relevance (Rogers, Kuiper, & Kirker, 1977). Could semantic encoding be beneficial to you as you

attempt to memorize the concepts in this chapter?
Storage
Once the information has been encoded, we have to somehow retain it. Our brains take the encoded
information and place it in storage. Storage is the creation of a permanent record of information.
In order for a memory to go into storage (i.e., long-term memory), it has to pass through three distinct stages:
Sensory Memory, Short-Term Memory, and finally Long-Term Memory. These stages were first proposed by
Richard Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin (1968). Their model of human memory (Figure 8.4), called Atkinson
and Shiffrin's model, is based on the belief that we process memories in the same way that a computer
processes information.
FIGURE 8.4 According to the Atkinson-Shiffrin model of memory, information passes through three distinct stages
in order for it to be stored in long-term memory.
Atkinson and Shiffrin's model is not the only model of memory. Baddeley and Hitch (1974) proposed a working
memory model in which short-term memory has different forms. In their model, storing memories in short-
term memory is like opening different files on a computer and adding information. The working memory files
hold a limited amount of information. The type of short-term memory (or computer file) depends on the type
of information received. There are memories in visual-spatial form, as well as memories of spoken or written
material, and they are stored in three short-term systems: a visuospatial sketchpad, an episodic buffer
(Baddeley, 2000), and a phonological loop. According to Baddeley and Hitch, a central executive part of
memory supervises or controls the flow of information to and from the three short-term systems, and the
central executive is responsible for moving information into long-term memory.
Sensory Memory
In the Atkinson-Shiffrin model, stimuli from the environment are processed first in sensory memory: storage
of brief sensory events, such as sights, sounds, and tastes. It is very brief storage—up to a couple of seconds. We
are constantly bombarded with sensory information. We cannot absorb all of it, or even most of it. And most of
it has no impact on our lives. For example, what was your professor wearing the last class period? As long as
the professor was dressed appropriately, it does not really matter what she was wearing. Sensory information
about sights, sounds, smells, and even textures, which we do not view as valuable information, we discard. If
we view something as valuable, the information will move into our short-term memory system.
Short-Term Memory
Short-term memory (STM) is a temporary storage system that processes incoming sensory memory. The
terms short-term and working memory are sometimes used interchangeably, but they are not exactly the
same. Short-term memory is more accurately described as a component of working memory. Short-term
memory takes information from sensory memory and sometimes connects that memory to something already

in long-term memory. Short-term memory storage lasts 15 to 30 seconds. Think of it as the information you
have displayed on your computer screen, such as a document, spreadsheet, or website. Then, information in
STM goes to long-term memory (you save it to your hard drive), or it is discarded (you delete a document or
close a web browser).
Rehearsal moves information from short-term memory to long-term memory. Active rehearsal is a way of
attending to information to move it from short-term to long-term memory. During active rehearsal, you repeat
(practice) the information to be remembered. If you repeat it enough, it may be moved into long-term memory.
For example, this type of active rehearsal is the way many children learn their ABCs by singing the alphabet
song. Alternatively, elaborative rehearsal is the act of linking new information you are trying to learn to
existing information that you already know. For example, if you meet someone at a party and your phone is
dead but you want to remember his phone number, which starts with area code 203, you might remember that
your uncle Abdul lives in Connecticut and has a 203 area code. This way, when you try to remember the phone
number of your new prospective friend, you will easily remember the area code. Craik and Lockhart (1972)
proposed the levels of processing hypothesis that states the deeper you think about something, the better you
remember it.
You may find yourself asking, “How much information can our memory handle at once?” To explore the
capacity and duration of your short-term memory, have a partner read the strings of random numbers (Figure
8.5) out loud to you, beginning each string by saying, “Ready?” and ending each by saying, “Recall,” at which
point you should try to write down the string of numbers from memory.
FIGURE 8.5 Work through this series of numbers using the recall exercise explained above to determine the longest
string of digits that you can store.
Note the longest string at which you got the series correct. For most people, the capacity will probably be close
to 7 plus or minus 2. In 1956, George Miller reviewed most of the research on the capacity of short-term
memory and found that people can retain between 5 and 9 items, so he reported the capacity of short-term
memory was the ""magic number"" 7 plus or minus 2. However, more contemporary research has found
working memory capacity is 4 plus or minus 1 (Cowan, 2010). Generally, recall is somewhat better for random
numbers than for random letters (Jacobs, 1887) and also often slightly better for information we hear (acoustic
encoding) rather than information we see (visual encoding) (Anderson, 1969).
Memory trace decay and interference are two factors that affect short-term memory retention. Peterson and
Peterson (1959) investigated short-term memory using the three letter sequences called trigrams (e.g., CLS)
that had to be recalled after various time intervals between 3 and 18 seconds. Participants remembered about
80% of the trigrams after a 3-second delay, but only 10% after a delay of 18 seconds, which caused them to
conclude that short-term memory decayed in 18 seconds. During decay, the memory trace becomes less
activated over time, and the information is forgotten. However, Keppel and Underwood (1962) examined only
the first trials of the trigram task and found that proactive interference also affected short-term memory
retention. During proactive interference, previously learned information interferes with the ability to learn
new information. Both memory trace decay and proactive interference affect short-term memory. Once the
information reaches long-term memory, it has to be consolidated at both the synaptic level, which takes a few
hours, and into the memory system, which can take weeks or longer.
Long-term Memory
Long-term memory (LTM) is the continuous storage of information. Unlike short-term memory, long-term
memory storage capacity is believed to be unlimited. It encompasses all the things you can remember that
happened more than just a few minutes ago. One cannot really consider long-term memory without thinking
about the way it is organized. Really quickly, what is the first word that comes to mind when you hear “peanut

butter”? Did you think of jelly? If you did, you probably have associated peanut butter and jelly in your mind. It
is generally accepted that memories are organized in semantic (or associative) networks (Collins & Loftus,
1975). A semantic network consists of concepts, and as you may recall from what you’ve learned about
memory, concepts are categories or groupings of linguistic information, images, ideas, or memories, such as
life experiences. Although individual experiences and expertise can affect concept arrangement, concepts are
believed to be arranged hierarchically in the mind (Anderson & Reder, 1999; Johnson & Mervis, 1997, 1998;
Palmer, Jones, Hennessy, Unze, & Pick, 1989; Rosch, Mervis, Gray, Johnson, & Boyes-Braem, 1976; Tanaka &
Taylor, 1991). Related concepts are linked, and the strength of the link depends on how often two concepts
have been associated.
Semantic networks differ depending on personal experiences. Importantly for memory, activating any part of a
semantic network also activates the concepts linked to that part to a lesser degree. The process is known as
spreading activation (Collins & Loftus, 1975). If one part of a network is activated, it is easier to access the
associated concepts because they are already partially activated. When you remember or recall something,
you activate a concept, and the related concepts are more easily remembered because they are partially
activated. However, the activations do not spread in just one direction. When you remember something, you
usually have several routes to get the information you are trying to access, and the more links you have to a
concept, the better your chances of remembering.
There are two types of long-term memory: explicit and implicit (Figure 8.6). Understanding the difference
between explicit memory and implicit memory is important because aging, particular types of brain trauma,
and certain disorders can impact explicit and implicit memory in different ways. Explicit memories are those
we consciously try to remember, recall, and report. For example, if you are studying for your chemistry exam,
the material you are learning will be part of your explicit memory. In keeping with the computer analogy, some
information in your long-term memory would be like the information you have saved on the hard drive. It is
not there on your desktop (your short-term memory), but most of the time you can pull up this information
when you want it. Not all long-term memories are strong memories, and some memories can only be recalled
using prompts. For example, you might easily recall a fact, such as the capital of the United States, but you
might struggle to recall the name of the restaurant at which you had dinner when you visited a nearby city last
summer. A prompt, such as that the restaurant was named after its owner, might help you recall the name of
the restaurant. Explicit memory is sometimes referred to as declarative memory, because it can be put into
words. Explicit memory is divided into episodic memory and semantic memory.

about how memories are stored and retrieved.
Episodic memory is information about events we have personally experienced (i.e., an episode). For instance,
the memory of your last birthday is an episodic memory. Usually, episodic memory is reported as a story. The
concept of episodic memory was first proposed about in the 1970s (Tulving, 1972). Since then, Tulving and
others have reformulated the theory, and currently scientists believe that episodic memory is memory about
happenings in particular places at particular times—the what, where, and when of an event (Tulving, 2002). It
involves recollection of visual imagery as well as the feeling of familiarity (Hassabis & Maguire, 2007).
Semantic memory is knowledge about words, concepts, and language-based knowledge and facts. Semantic
memory is typically reported as facts. Semantic means having to do with language and knowledge about
language. For example, answers to the following questions like “what is the definition of psychology” and “who
was the first African American president of the United States” are stored in your semantic memory.
Implicit memories are long-term memories that are not part of our consciousness. Although implicit
memories are learned outside of our awareness and cannot be consciously recalled, implicit memory is
demonstrated in the performance of some task (Roediger, 1990; Schacter, 1987). Implicit memory has been

Context: between 73 and 79 years old (Singh & Siahpush, 2006), we can expect to spend approximately 25 years of our lives sleeping. Some animals never sleep (e.g., some fish and amphibian species); other animals sleep very little without apparent negative consequences (e.g., giraffes); yet some animals (e.g., rats) die after two weeks of sleep deprivation (Siegel, 2008). Why do we devote so much time to sleeping? Is it absolutely essential that we sleep? This section will consider these questions and explore various explanations for why we sleep. What is Sleep? You have read that sleep is distinguished by low levels of physical activity and reduced sensory awareness. As discussed by Siegel (2008), a definition of sleep must also include mention of the interplay of the circadian and homeostatic mechanisms that regulate sleep. Homeostatic regulation of sleep is evidenced by sleep rebound following sleep deprivation. Sleep rebound refers to the fact that a sleep-deprived individual will fall asleep more quickly during subsequent opportunities for sleep. Sleep is characterized by certain patterns of activity of the brain that can be visualized using electroencephalography (EEG), and different phases of sleep can be differentiated using EEG as well. Sleep-wake cycles seem to be controlled by multiple brain areas acting in conjunction with one another. Some of these areas include the thalamus, the hypothalamus, and the pons. As already mentioned, the hypothalamus contains the SCN—the biological clock of the body—in addition to other nuclei that, in conjunction with the thalamus, regulate slow-wave sleep. The pons is important for regulating rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (National Institutes of Health, n.d.). Sleep is also associated with the secretion and regulation of a number of hormones from several endocrine glands including: melatonin, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and growth hormone (National Institutes of Health, n.d.). You have read that the pineal gland releases melatonin during sleep (Figure 4.6). Melatonin is thought to be involved in regulating the sleep/wake cycle. In addition, melatonin also plays an important role in maintaining the homeostasis of body temperature, blood pressure, and blood glucose levels. It has also been shown to have a positive effect on the immune system, which is important in the fight against viral infections. The sleep cycle is divided into four stages: NREM (non-rapid eye movement) and REM (rapid-eye-movement) sleep. During the first stage (NREM sleep), the heart rate and breathing rate slow down. This is followed by a period of light sleep, during which the eyes move rapidly from side to side and there is no sense of time. During the second stage, known as the deep sleep phase, brain waves become slower and more regular. At this point, a person may feel drowsy, but is still able to respond to external stimuli. Finally, at the third stage, known as REM sleep or wakefulness, there are rapid changes in brain wave activity, including increased brain waves and increased muscle activity. REM is the stage in which dreaming occurs. After the fourth stage (NREM stage 3) is reached, sleep begins to wane and consciousness returns to normal. There are many factors that influence the duration and quality of each sleep stage. These factors include age, sex, body mass index (BMI), sleep environment (temperature, lighting, etc.), and environmental stimuli (such as noise, light, music, or television). Sleep deprivation can also be caused by a variety of explanations. For example, some people may have difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep due to psychological factors such as anxiety or depression. Others may suffer from sleep apnea or other sleep disorders that prevent them from getting a full night's rest. There are also many medical conditions that can cause sleep disturbances. A few examples of these conditions include narcolepsy, restless legs syndrome, parasomnias (including sleepwalking and night terrors), hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid gland), polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBD). These conditions can affect the quality and duration of one's sleep and can lead to daytime sleepiness, fatigue, irritability, mood disturbances, or other negative effects on daily functioning.

7,"exclusively same-sex sexual behavior are socially prescribed as a part of normal development and maturation.
For example, in parts of New Guinea, young boys are expected to engage in sexual behavior with other boys for
a given period of time because it is believed that doing so is necessary for these boys to become men (Baldwin
& Baldwin, 1989).
There has historically been a two-gendered culture in the United States. We have tended to classify an
individual as either male or female according to the sex they were assigned at birth, leading the United States
to be considered a cisnormative society. However, in some cultures there are additional gender variants
resulting in more than two gender categories. For example, in Thailand, you can be male, female, or kathoey. A
kathoey is an individual who would be described as intersex or transgender in the United States
(Tangmunkongvorakul, Banwell, Carmichael, Utomo, & Sleigh, 2010).
The Case of David Reimer
In August of 1965, Janet and Ronald Reimer of Winnipeg, Canada, welcomed the birth of their twin sons, Bruce
and Brian. Within a few months, the twins were experiencing urinary problems; doctors recommended the
problems could be alleviated by having the boys circumcised. A malfunction of the medical equipment used to
perform the circumcision resulted in Bruce’s penis being irreparably damaged. Distraught, Janet and Ronald
looked to expert advice on what to do with their baby boy. By happenstance, the couple became aware of Dr.
John Money at Johns Hopkins University and his theory of psychosexual neutrality (Colapinto, 2000).
Dr. Money had spent a considerable amount of time researching transgender individuals and individuals born
with ambiguous genitalia. As a result of this work, he developed a theory of psychosexual neutrality. His theory
asserted that we are essentially neutral at birth with regard to our gender identity and that we don’t assume a
concrete gender identity until we begin to master language. Furthermore, Dr. Money believed that the way in
which we are socialized in early life is ultimately much more important than our biology in determining our
gender identity (Money, 1962).
Dr. Money encouraged Janet and Ronald to bring the twins to Johns Hopkins University, and he convinced them
that they should raise Bruce as a girl. Left with few other options at the time, Janet and Ronald agreed to have
Bruce’s testicles removed and to raise him as a girl. When they returned home to Canada, they brought with them
Brian and his “sister,” Brenda, along with specific instructions to never reveal to Brenda that she had been born a
boy (Colapinto, 2000).
Early on, Dr. Money shared with the scientific community the great success of this natural experiment that
seemed to fully support his theory of psychosexual neutrality (Money, 1975). Indeed, in early interviews with the
children it appeared that Brenda was a typical little girl who liked to play with “girly” toys and do “girly” things.
However, Dr. Money was less than forthcoming with information that seemed to argue against the success of the
case. In reality, Brenda’s parents were constantly concerned that their little girl wasn’t really behaving as most
girls did, and by the time Brenda was nearing adolescence, it was painfully obvious to the family that she was
really having a hard time identifying as a female. In addition, Brenda was becoming increasingly reluctant to
continue her visits with Dr. Money to the point that she threatened suicide if her parents made her go back to see
him again.
At that point, Janet and Ronald disclosed the true nature of Brenda’s early childhood to their daughter. While
initially shocked, Brenda reported that things made sense to her now, and ultimately, by the time she was an
adolescent, Brenda had decided to identify as a male. Thus, she became David Reimer.
David was quite comfortable in his masculine role. He made new friends and began to think about his future.
Although his castration had left him infertile, he still wanted to be a father. In 1990, David married a single

mother and loved his new role as a husband and father. In 1997, David was made aware that Dr. Money was
continuing to publicize his case as a success supporting his theory of psychosexual neutrality. This prompted
David and his brother to go public with their experiences in attempt to discredit the doctor’s publications. While
this revelation created a firestorm in the scientific community for Dr. Money, it also triggered a series of
unfortunate events that ultimately led to David dying by suicide in 2004 (O’Connell, 2004).
This sad story speaks to the complexities involved in gender identity. While the Reimer case had earlier been
paraded as a hallmark of how socialization trumped biology in terms of gender identity, the truth of the story
made the scientific and medical communities more cautious in dealing with cases that involve intersex children
and how to deal with their unique circumstances. In fact, stories like this one have prompted measures to
prevent unnecessary harm and suffering to children who might have issues with gender identity. For example, in
2013, a law took effect in Germany allowing parents of intersex children to classify their children as
indeterminate so that children can self-assign the appropriate gender once they have fully developed their own
gender identities (Paramaguru, 2013).

10.4 Emotion
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Explain the major theories of emotion
• Describe the role that limbic structures play in emotional processing
• Understand the ubiquitous nature of producing and recognizing emotional expression
As we move through our daily lives, we experience a variety of emotions. An emotion is a subjective state of
being that we often describe as our feelings. Emotions result from the combination of subjective experience,
expression, cognitive appraisal, and physiological responses (Levenson, Carstensen, Friesen, & Ekman, 1991).
However, as discussed later in the chapter, the exact order in which the components occur is not clear, and
some parts may happen at the same time. An emotion often begins with a subjective (individual) experience,
which is a stimulus. Often the stimulus is external, but it does not have to be from the outside world. For
example, it might be that one thinks about war and becomes sad, even though they never experienced war.
Emotional expression refers to the way one displays an emotion and includes nonverbal and verbal behaviors
(Gross, 1999). One also performs a cognitive appraisal in which a person tries to determine the way they will be
impacted by a situation (Roseman & Smith, 2001). In addition, emotions include physiological responses, such
as possible changes in heart rate, sweating, etc. (Soussignan, 2002).
The words emotion and mood are sometimes used interchangeably, but psychologists use these words to refer
to two different things. Typically, the word emotion indicates a subjective, affective state that is relatively
intense and that occurs in response to something we experience (Figure 10.20). Emotions are often thought to
be consciously experienced and intentional. Mood, on the other hand, refers to a prolonged, less intense,
affective state that does not occur in response to something we experience. Mood states may not be
consciously recognized and do not carry the intentionality that is associated with emotion (Beedie, Terry, Lane,
& Devonport, 2011). Here we will focus on emotion, and you will learn more about mood in the chapter that
covers psychological disorders.

We can be at the heights of joy or in the depths of despair. We might feel angry when we are betrayed, fear
when we are threatened, and surprised when something unexpected happens. This section will outline some
of the most well-known theories explaining our emotional experience and provide insight into the biological
bases of emotion. This section closes with a discussion of the ubiquitous nature of facial expressions of
emotion and our abilities to recognize those expressions in others.
Theories of Emotion
Our emotional states are combinations of physiological arousal, psychological appraisal, and subjective
experiences. Together, these are the components of emotion, and our experiences, backgrounds, and cultures
inform our emotions. Therefore, different people may have different emotional experiences even when faced
with similar circumstances. Over time, several different theories of emotion, shown in Figure 10.21, have been
proposed to explain how the various components of emotion interact with one another.
10.4 • Emotion 343
FIGURE 10.21 This figure illustrates the major assertions of the James-Lange, Cannon-Bard, and Schachter-Singer
two-factor theories of emotion. (credit ""snake"": modification of work by ""tableatny""/Flickr; credit ""face"":

The James-Lange theory of emotion asserts that emotions arise from physiological arousal. Recall what you
have learned about the sympathetic nervous system and our fight or flight response when threatened. If you
were to encounter some threat in your environment, like a venomous snake in your backyard, your
sympathetic nervous system would initiate significant physiological arousal, which would make your heart
race and increase your respiration rate. According to the James-Lange theory of emotion, you would only
experience a feeling of fear after this physiological arousal had taken place. Furthermore, different arousal
patterns would be associated with different feelings.
Other theorists, however, doubted that the physiological arousal that occurs with different types of emotions is
344 10 • Emotion and Motivation
Access for free at openstax.org
distinct enough to result in the wide variety of emotions that we experience. Thus, the Cannon-Bard theory of
emotion was developed. According to this view, physiological arousal and emotional experience occur
simultaneously, yet independently (Lang, 1994). So, when you see the venomous snake, you feel fear at exactly
the same time that your body mounts its fight or flight response. This emotional reaction would be separate
and independent of the physiological arousal, even though they co-occur.
Does smiling make you happy? Alternatively, does being happy make you smile? The facial feedback
hypothesis proposes that your facial expression can actually affect your emotional experience (Adelman &
Zajonc, 1989; Boiger & Mesquita, 2012; Buck, 1980; Capella, 1993; Soussignan, 2001). Research investigating
the facial feedback hypothesis suggested that suppression of facial expression of emotion lowered the
intensity of some emotions experienced by participants (Davis, Senghas, & Ochsner, 2009). Havas, Glenberg,
Gutowski, Lucarelli, and Davidson (2010) used Botox injections to paralyze facial muscles and limit facial
expressions, including frowning, and they found that depressed people reported less depression after their
frowning muscles were paralyzed. Other research found that the intensities of facial expressions affected the
emotional reactions (Soussignan, 2002). In other words, if something insignificant occurs and you smile as if
you just won lottery, you will actually be happier about the little thing than you would be if you only had a tiny
smile. Conversely, if you walk around frowning all the time, it might cause you to have less positive emotions
than you would if you had smiled. Interestingly, Soussignan (2002) also reported physiological arousal
differences associated with the intensities of one type of smile.
G. Marañon Posadillo was a Spanish physician who studied the psychological effects of adrenaline to create a
model for the experience of emotion. Marañon's model preceded Schachter's two-factor or arousal-cognition
theory of emotion (Cornelius, 1991). The Schachter-Singer two-factor theory of emotion is another variation
on theories of emotions that takes into account both physiological arousal and the emotional experience.
According to this theory, emotions are composed of two factors: physiological and cognitive. In other words,
physiological arousal is interpreted in context to produce the emotional experience. In revisiting our example
involving the venomous snake in your backyard, the two-factor theory maintains that the snake elicits
sympathetic nervous system activation that is labeled as fear given the context, and our experience is that of
fear. If you had labeled your sympathetic nervous system activation as joy, you would have experienced joy.
The Schachter-Singer two-factor theory depends on labeling the physiological experience, which is a type of
cognitive appraisal.
Magda Arnold was the first theorist to offer an exploration of the meaning of appraisal, and to present an
outline of what the appraisal process might be and how it relates to emotion (Roseman & Smith, 2001). The key
idea of appraisal theory is that you have thoughts (a cognitive appraisal) before you experience an emotion,
and the emotion you experience depends on the thoughts you had (Frijda, 1988; Lazarus, 1991). If you think
something is positive, you will have more positive emotions about it than if your appraisal was negative, and
the opposite is true. Appraisal theory explains the way two people can have two completely different emotions
regarding the same event. For example, suppose your psychology instructor selected you to lecture on
emotion; you might see that as positive, because it represents an opportunity to be the center of attention, and
you would experience happiness. However, if you dislike speaking in public, you could have a negative
appraisal and experience discomfort.
Schachter and Singer believed that physiological arousal is very similar across the different types of emotions
that we experience, and therefore, the cognitive appraisal of the situation is critical to the actual emotion
experienced. In fact, it might be possible to misattribute arousal to an emotional experience if the
circumstances were right (Schachter & Singer, 1962). They performed a clever experiment to test their idea. A
group of men participating in the experiment were randomly assigned to one of several groups. Some of the
participants received injections of epinephrine that caused bodily changes that mimicked the fight-or-flight
response of the sympathetic nervous system; however, only some of these men were told to expect these
reactions as side effects of the injection. The other men that received injections of epinephrine were told either
that the injection would have no side effects or that it would result in a side effect unrelated to a sympathetic
10.4 • Emotion 345
FIGURE 10.24 The seven universal facial expressions of emotion are shown. (credit: modification of work by Cory
Zanker)
Of course, emotion is not only displayed through facial expression. We also use the tone of our voices, various
behaviors, and body language to communicate information about our emotional states. Body language is the
expression of emotion in terms of body position or movement. Research suggests that we are quite sensitive to
the emotional information communicated through body language, even if we’re not consciously aware of it (de
Gelder, 2006; Tamietto et al., 2009).

Emotional Expression and Emotion Regulation
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a set of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by repetitive behaviors and
communication and social problems. Children who have autism spectrum disorders have difficulty recognizing the
emotional states of others, and research has shown that this may stem from an inability to distinguish various
nonverbal expressions of emotion (i.e., facial expressions) from one another (Hobson, 1986). In addition, there is
evidence to suggest that autistic individuals also have difficulty expressing emotion through tone of voice and by
producing facial expressions (Macdonald et al., 1989). Difficulties with emotional recognition and expression may
contribute to the behaviors that characterize autism; therefore, various therapeutic approaches have been explored
to address these difficulties. Various educational curricula, cognitive-behavioral therapies, and pharmacological
therapies have shown some promise in helping autistic individuals process emotionally relevant information
(Bauminger, 2002; Golan & Baron-Cohen, 2006; Guastella et al., 2010).
Emotion regulation describes how people respond to situations and experiences by modifying their emotional

experiences and expressions. Covert emotion regulation strategies are those that occur within the individual, while
overt strategies involve others or actions (such as seeking advice or consuming alcohol). Aldao and Dixon (2014)
studied the relationship between overt emotional regulation strategies and psychopathology. They researched how
218 undergraduate students reported their use of covert and overt strategies and their reported symptoms
associated with selected mental disorders, and found that overt emotional regulation strategies were better
predictors of psychopathology than covert strategies. Another study examined the relationship between pregaming
(the act of drinking heavily before a social event) and two emotion regulation strategies to understand how these
might contribute to alcohol-related problems; results suggested a relationship but a complicated one (Pederson,
2016). Further research is needed in these areas to better understand patterns of adaptive and maladaptive
emotion regulation (Aldao & Dixon-Gordon, 2014).

Summary
10.1 Motivation
Motivation to engage in a given behavior can come from internal and/or external factors. Multiple theories
have been put forward regarding motivation. More biologically oriented theories deal with the ways that
instincts and the need to maintain bodily homeostasis motivate behavior. Bandura postulated that our sense of
self-efficacy motivates behaviors, and there are a number of theories that focus on a variety of social motives.
Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of needs is a model that shows the relationship among multiple motives that
range from lower-level physiological needs to the very high level of self-actualization.
10.2 Hunger and Eating
Hunger and satiety are highly regulated processes that result in a person maintaining a fairly stable weight
that is resistant to change. When more calories are consumed than expended, a person will store excess
energy as fat. Being significantly overweight adds substantially to a person’s health risks and problems,
including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, and other medical issues. Sociocultural
factors that emphasize thinness as a beauty ideal and a genetic predisposition contribute to the development
of eating disorders in many young females, though eating disorders span ages and genders.
10.3 Sexual Behavior
The hypothalamus and structures of the limbic system are important in sexual behavior and motivation. There
is evidence to suggest that our motivation to engage in sexual behavior and our ability to do so are related, but
separate, processes. Alfred Kinsey conducted large-scale survey research that demonstrated the incredible
diversity of human sexuality. William Masters and Virginia Johnson observed individuals engaging in sexual
behavior in developing their concept of the sexual response cycle. While often interchanged, sexual orientation
and gender identity are related, but distinct, concepts.
10.4 Emotion
Emotions are subjective experiences that consist of physiological arousal and cognitive appraisal. Various
theories have been put forward to explain our emotional experiences. The James-Lange theory asserts that
emotions arise as a function of physiological arousal. The Cannon-Bard theory maintains that emotional
experience occurs simultaneous to and independent of physiological arousal. The Schachter-Singer two-factor
theory suggests that physiological arousal receives cognitive labels as a function of the relevant context and
that these two factors together result in an emotional experience.
The limbic system is the brain’s emotional circuit, which includes the amygdala and the hippocampus. Both of
these structures are implicated in playing a role in normal emotional processing as well as in psychological
mood and anxiety disorders. Increased amygdala activity is associated with learning to fear, and it is seen in
individuals who are at risk for or suffering from mood disorders. The volume of the hippocampus has been

shown to be reduced in individuals suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder.
The ability to produce and recognize facial expressions of emotions seems to be universal regardless of
cultural background. However, there are cultural display rules which influence how often and under what
circumstances various emotions can be expressed. Tone of voice and body language also serve as a means by
which we communicate information about our emotional states.

FIGURE 12.26 The events of 9/11 unleashed an enormous show of altruism and heroism on the parts of first
responders and many ordinary people. (credit: Don Halasy)
Some researchers suggest that altruism operates on empathy. Empathy is the capacity to understand another
person’s perspective, to feel what they feel. An empathetic person makes an emotional connection with others
and feels compelled to help (Batson, 1991). Other researchers argue that altruism is a form of selfless helping
that is not motivated by benefits or feeling good about oneself. Certainly, after helping, people feel good about
themselves, but some researchers argue that this is a consequence of altruism, not a cause. Other researchers
argue that helping is always self-serving because our egos are involved, and we receive benefits from helping
(Cialdini, Brown, Lewis, Luce, & Neuberg 1997). It is challenging to determine experimentally the true
motivation for helping, whether it is largely self-serving (egoism) or selfless (altruism). Thus, a debate on
whether pure altruism exists continues.

Forming Relationships
What do you think is the single most influential factor in determining with whom you become friends and
whom you form romantic relationships? You might be surprised to learn that the answer is simple: the people
with whom you have the most contact. This most important factor is proximity. You are more likely to be
friends with people you have regular contact with. For example, there are decades of research that shows that
you are more likely to become friends with people who live in your dorm, your apartment building, or your
immediate neighborhood than with people who live farther away (Festinger, Schachler, & Back, 1950). It is
simply easier to form relationships with people you see often because you have the opportunity to get to know
them.
Similarity is another factor that influences who we form relationships with. We are more likely to become
friends or lovers with someone who is similar to us in background, attitudes, and lifestyle. In fact, there is no
evidence that opposites attract. Rather, we are attracted to people who are most like us (Figure 12.27)
(McPherson, Smith-Lovin, & Cook, 2001). Why do you think we are attracted to people who are similar to us?
Sharing things in common will certainly make it easy to get along with others and form connections. When you
and another person share similar music taste, hobbies, food preferences, and so on, deciding what to do with
your time together might be easy. Homophily is the tendency for people to form social networks, including
friendships, marriage, business relationships, and many other types of relationships, with others who are
12.7 • Prosocial Behavior 433
similar (McPherson et al., 2001).
FIGURE 12.27 People tend to be attracted to similar people. Many couples share a cultural background. This can be
quite obvious in a ceremony such as a wedding, and more subtle (but no less significant) in the day-to-day workings
of a relationship. (credit: modification of work by Shiraz Chanawala)
But, homophily limits our exposure to diversity (McPherson et al., 2001). By forming relationships only with
people who are similar to us, we will have homogenous groups and will not be exposed to different points of
view. In other words, because we are likely to spend time with those who are most like ourselves, we will have
limited exposure to those who are different than ourselves, including people of different races, ethnicities,
social-economic status, and life situations.
Once we form relationships with people, we desire reciprocity. Reciprocity is the give and take in
relationships. We contribute to relationships, but we expect to receive benefits as well. That is, we want our
relationships to be a two way street. We are more likely to like and engage with people who like us back. Self-
disclosure is part of the two way street. Self-disclosure is the sharing of personal information (Laurenceau,
Barrett, & Pietromonaco, 1998). We form more intimate connections with people with whom we disclose
important information about ourselves. Indeed, self-disclosure is a characteristic of healthy intimate
relationships, as long as the information disclosed is consistent with our own views (Cozby, 1973).
Attraction
We have discussed how proximity and similarity lead to the formation of relationships, and that reciprocity
and self-disclosure are important for relationship maintenance. But, what features of a person do we find
attractive? We don’t form relationships with everyone that lives or works near us, so how is it that we decide
which specific individuals we will select as friends and lovers?
Researchers have documented several characteristics that humans find attractive. First we look for friends and
lovers who are physically attractive. People differ in what they consider attractive, and attractiveness is
culturally influenced. Research, however, suggests that some universally attractive features in women include
large eyes, high cheekbones, a narrow jaw line, a slender build (Buss, 1989), and a lower waist-to-hip ratio
(Singh, 1993). For men, attractive traits include being tall, having broad shoulders, and a narrow waist (Buss,
1989). Both men and women with high levels of facial and body symmetry are generally considered more
attractive than asymmetric individuals (Fink, Neave, Manning, & Grammer, 2006; Penton-Voak et al., 2001;
Rikowski & Grammer, 1999). Social traits that people find attractive in potential female mates include warmth,
affection, and social skills; in males, the attractive traits include achievement, leadership qualities, and job
skills (Regan & Berscheid, 1997). Although humans want mates who are physically attractive, this does not
mean that we look for the most attractive person possible. In fact, this observation has led some to propose
what is known as the matching hypothesis which asserts that people tend to pick someone they view as their
equal in physical attractiveness and social desirability (Taylor, Fiore, Mendelsohn, & Cheshire, 2011). For
example, you and most people you know likely would say that a very attractive movie star is out of your league.

So, even if you had proximity to that person, you likely would not ask them out on a date because you believe
you likely would be rejected. People weigh a potential partner’s attractiveness against the likelihood of success
with that person. If you think you are particularly unattractive (even if you are not), you likely will seek
partners that are fairly unattractive (that is, unattractive in physical appearance or in behavior).
Sternberg’s Triangular Theory of Love
We typically love the people with whom we form relationships, but the type of love we have for our family,
friends, and lovers differs. Robert Sternberg (1986) proposed that there are three components of love:
intimacy, passion, and commitment. These three components form a triangle that defines multiple types of
love: this is known as Sternberg’s triangular theory of love (Figure 12.28). Intimacy is the sharing of details
and intimate thoughts and emotions. Passion is the physical attraction—the flame in the fire. Commitment is
standing by the person—the “in sickness and health” part of the relationship.
FIGURE 12.28 According to Sternberg’s triangular theory of love, seven types of love can be described from
combinations of three components: intimacy, passion, and commitment. (credit: modification of work by
“Lnesa”/Wikimedia Commons)
Sternberg (1986) states that a healthy relationship will have all three components of love—intimacy, passion,
and commitment—which is described as consummate love (Figure 12.29). However, different aspects of love
might be more prevalent at different life stages. Other forms of love include liking, which is defined as having
intimacy but no passion or commitment. Infatuation is the presence of passion without intimacy or
commitment. Empty love is having commitment without intimacy or passion. Companionate love, which is
characteristic of close friendships and family relationships, consists of intimacy and commitment but no
passion. Romantic love is defined by having passion and intimacy, but no commitment. Finally, fatuous love is
defined by having passion and commitment, but no intimacy, such as a long term sexual love affair. Can you
describe other examples of relationships that fit these different types of love?

FIGURE 12.29 According to Sternberg, consummate love describes a healthy relationship containing intimacy,

Social Exchange Theory
We have discussed why we form relationships, what attracts us to others, and different types of love. But what
determines whether we are satisfied with and stay in a relationship? One theory that provides an explanation
is social exchange theory. According to social exchange theory, we act as naïve economists in keeping a tally
of the ratio of costs and benefits of forming and maintaining a relationship with others (Figure 12.30) (Rusbult
& Van Lange, 2003).
FIGURE 12.30 Acting like naïve economists, people may keep track of the costs and benefits of maintaining a
relationship. Typically, only those relationships in which the benefits outweigh the costs will be maintained.
People are motivated to maximize the benefits of social exchanges, or relationships, and minimize the costs.
People prefer to have more benefits than costs, or to have nearly equal costs and benefits, but most people are
dissatisfied if their social exchanges create more costs than benefits. Let’s discuss an example. If you have ever
decided to commit to a romantic relationship, you probably considered the advantages and disadvantages of
your decision. What are the benefits of being in a committed romantic relationship? You may have considered
having companionship, intimacy, and passion, but also being comfortable with a person you know well. What
are the costs of being in a committed romantic relationship? You may think that over time boredom from being
with only one person may set in; moreover, it may be expensive to share activities such as attending movies
and going to dinner. However, the benefits of dating your romantic partner presumably outweigh the costs, or
you wouldn’t continue the relationship.

Context: exclusively same-sex sexual behavior are socially prescribed as a part of normal development and maturation. For example, in parts of New Guinea, young boys are expected to engage in sexual behavior with other boys for a given period of time because it is believed that doing so is necessary for these boys to become men (Baldwin & Baldwin, 1989). There has historically been a two-gendered culture in the United States. We have tended to classify an individual as either male or female according to the sex they were assigned at birth, leading the United States to be considered a cisnormative society. However, in some cultures there are additional gender variants resulting in more than two gender categories. For example, in Thailand, you can be male, female, or kathoey. A kathoey is an individual who would be described as intersex or transgender in the United States (Tangmunkongvorakul, Banwell, Carmichael, Utomo, & Sleigh, 2010). The Case of David Reimer In August of 1965, Janet and Ronald Reimer of Winnipeg, Canada, welcomed the birth of their twin sons, Bruce and Brian. Within a few months, the twins were experiencing urinary problems; doctors recommended the problems could be alleviated by having the boys circumcised. A malfunction of the medical equipment used to perform the circumcision resulted in Bruce’s penis being irreparably damaged. Distraught, Janet and Ronald looked to expert advice on what to do with their baby boy. By happenstance, the couple became aware of Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University and his theory of psychosexual neutrality (Colapinto, 2000). Dr. Money had spent a considerable amount of time researching transgender individuals and individuals born with ambiguous genitalia. As a result of this work, he developed a theory of psychosexual neutrality. His theory asserted that we are essentially neutral at birth with regard to our gender identity and that we don’t assume a concrete gender identity until we begin to master language. Furthermore, Dr. Money believed that the way in which we are socialized in early life is ultimately much more important than our biology in determining our gender identity. In other words, we do not have to be born with a specific gender in order to have a gender identity. Rather, gender is a social construct that is determined by our interactions with the world around us. In the case of Bruce and Brian, their parents were unaware that their sons were transgender. Instead, they believed that Bruce was a normal boy who just needed to grow up and become a man. The Reimers did not know that they had a son who was transgender, but they did know that he was born male. They were not aware that their son’s gender was ambiguous, and so they assumed that his gender would remain ambiguous until he became an adult. This assumption was based on the fact that, at the time, there was no way to determine Bruce’s true gender. It was not until later in life, when Bruce began to learn more about his own gender, that he came to realize that it was important for him to identify as male. As a transgender person, I have had the privilege of being able to express my gender as I see fit. I have the freedom to live my life in a way that I believe is best for me, regardless of what others may think of me or how I am perceived by others. My gender does not define me; rather, it allows me to fully express myself in ways that are meaningful to me. When I was first diagnosed with gender dysphoria, my diagnosis was met with skepticism and disbelief. Many people thought that transgender people were mentally ill or mentally unstable. Some even accused me of having a mental illness because I had been diagnosed as transgender at such a young age. Despite these negative comments, many people have been supportive of me and have supported me in my quest for self-acceptance and self-love. I have come to understand that there is nothing inherently wrong with being transgender or gender nonconforming. It is important to remember that gender expression is not a reflection of a person’s biological sex. Gender expressions are a product of our socialization and our experiences with our world. While it may be difficult for some people to accept the idea of gender fluidity or the possibility of transitioning from one sex to another, this is only because we have not yet fully understood the complexities of human sexuality. Transgender people are just as valid as cisgendered people and deserve the same rights and opportunities as everyone else.

personality traits dominate your personality.
Psychologists Hans and Sybil Eysenck were personality theorists (Figure 11.12) who focused on temperament,
the inborn, genetically based personality differences that you studied earlier in the chapter. They believed
personality is largely governed by biology. The Eysencks (Eysenck, 1990, 1992; Eysenck & Eysenck, 1963)
viewed people as having two specific personality dimensions: extroversion/introversion and neuroticism/
stability.

According to their theory, people high on the trait of extroversion are sociable and outgoing, and readily
connect with others, whereas people high on the trait of introversion have a higher need to be alone, engage in
solitary behaviors, and limit their interactions with others. In the neuroticism/stability dimension, people high
on neuroticism tend to be anxious; they tend to have an overactive sympathetic nervous system and, even with
low stress, their bodies and emotional state tend to go into a flight-or-fight reaction. In contrast, people high on
stability tend to need more stimulation to activate their flight-or-fight reaction and are considered more
emotionally stable. Based on these two dimensions, the Eysencks’ theory divides people into four quadrants.
These quadrants are sometimes compared with the four temperaments described by the Greeks: melancholic,
choleric, phlegmatic, and sanguine (Figure 11.13).
11.7 • Trait Theorists 381
FIGURE 11.13 The Eysencks described two factors to account for variations in our personalities: extroversion/
introversion and emotional stability/instability.
Later, the Eysencks added a third dimension: psychoticism versus superego control (Eysenck, Eysenck &
Barrett, 1985). In this dimension, people who are high on psychoticism tend to be independent thinkers, cold,
nonconformists, impulsive, antisocial, and hostile, whereas people who are high on superego control tend to
have high impulse control—they are more altruistic, empathetic, cooperative, and conventional (Eysenck,
Eysenck & Barrett, 1985).
While Cattell’s 16 factors may be too broad, the Eysenck’s two-factor system has been criticized for being too
narrow. Another personality theory, called the Five Factor Model, effectively hits a middle ground, with its five
factors referred to as the Big Five personality factors. It is the most popular theory in personality psychology
today and the most accurate approximation of the basic personality dimensions (Funder, 2001). The five
factors are openness to experience, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism (Figure
11.14). A helpful way to remember the factors is by using the mnemonic OCEAN.
In the Five Factor Model, each person has each factor, but they occur along a spectrum. Openness to
experience is characterized by imagination, feelings, actions, and ideas. People who score high on this factor
tend to be curious and have a wide range of interests. Conscientiousness is characterized by competence, self-
discipline, thoughtfulness, and achievement-striving (goal-directed behavior). People who score high on this
factor are hardworking and dependable. Numerous studies have found a positive correlation between
conscientiousness and academic success (Akomolafe, 2013; Chamorro-Premuzic & Furnham, 2008; Conrad &
Patry, 2012; Noftle & Robins, 2007; Wagerman & Funder, 2007). Extroversion is characterized by sociability,
assertiveness, excitement-seeking, and emotional expression. People who score high on this factor are usually
described as outgoing and warm. Not surprisingly, people who score high on both extroversion and openness
are more likely to participate in adventure and risky sports due to their curious and excitement-seeking nature
(Tok, 2011). The fourth factor is agreeableness, which is the tendency to be pleasant, cooperative, trustworthy,
and good-natured. People who score low on agreeableness tend to be described as rude and uncooperative, yet
one recent study reported that men who scored low on this factor actually earned more money than men who
were considered more agreeable (Judge, Livingston, & Hurst, 2012). The last of the Big Five factors is
382 11 • Personality
Access for free at openstax.org
neuroticism, which is the tendency to experience negative emotions. People high on neuroticism tend to
experience emotional instability and are characterized as angry, impulsive, and hostile. Watson and Clark
(1984) found that people reporting high levels of neuroticism also tend to report feeling anxious and unhappy.
In contrast, people who score low in neuroticism tend to be calm and even-tempered.
FIGURE 11.14 In the Five Factor Model, each person has five factors, each scored on a continuum from high to low.
In the center column, notice that the first letter of each factor spells the mnemonic OCEAN.
The Big Five personality factors each represent a range between two extremes. In reality, most of us tend to lie
somewhere midway along the continuum of each factor, rather than at polar ends. It’s important to note that
the Big Five factors are relatively stable over our lifespan, with some tendency for the factors to increase or
decrease slightly. Researchers have found that conscientiousness increases through young adulthood into
middle age, as we become better able to manage our personal relationships and careers (Donnellan & Lucas,
2008). Agreeableness also increases with age, peaking between 50 to 70 years (Terracciano, McCrae, Brant, &
Costa, 2005). Neuroticism and extroversion tend to decline slightly with age (Donnellan & Lucas; Terracciano
et al.). Additionally, The Big Five factors have been shown to exist across ethnicities, cultures, and ages, and
may have substantial biological and genetic components (Jang, Livesley, & Vernon, 1996; Jang et al., 2006;
McCrae & Costa, 1997; Schmitt et al., 2007).
Another model of personality traits is the HEXACO model. HEXACO is an acronym for six broad traits: honesty-
humility, emotionality, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience (Anglim &
O’Connor, 2018). Table 11.6 provides a brief overview of each trait.

11.8 Cultural Understandings of Personality
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section you should be able to:
• Discuss personality differences of people from collectivist and individualist cultures
• Discuss the three approaches to studying personality in a cultural context
As you have learned in this chapter, personality is shaped by both genetic and environmental factors. The
culture in which you live is one of the most important environmental factors that shapes your personality
(Triandis & Suh, 2002). The term culture refers to all of the beliefs, customs, art, and traditions of a particular
society. Culture is transmitted to people through language as well as through the modeling of culturally
acceptable and nonacceptable behaviors that are either rewarded or punished (Triandis & Suh, 2002). With
these ideas in mind, personality psychologists have become interested in the role of culture in understanding
personality. They ask whether personality traits are the same across cultures or if there are variations. It
appears that there are both universal and culture-specific aspects that account for variation in people’s
personalities.
Why might it be important to consider cultural influences on personality? Western ideas about personality
may not be applicable to other cultures (Benet-Martinez & Oishi, 2008). In fact, there is evidence that the
strength of personality traits varies across cultures. Let’s take a look at some of the Big Five factors
(conscientiousness, neuroticism, openness, and extroversion) across cultures. As you will learn when you
study social psychology, Asian cultures are more collectivist, and people in these cultures tend to be less
extroverted. People in Central and South American cultures tend to score higher on openness to experience,
whereas Europeans score higher on neuroticism (Benet-Martinez & Karakitapoglu-Aygun, 2003).
According to a study by Rentfrow and colleagues, there also seem to be regional personality differences within
the United States (Figure 11.15). Researchers analyzed responses from over 1.5 million individuals in the
United States and found that there are three distinct regional personality clusters: Cluster 1, which is in the
Upper Midwest and Deep South, is dominated by people who fall into the “friendly and conventional”
personality; Cluster 2, which includes the West, is dominated by people who are more relaxed, emotionally
384 11 • Personality
Access for free at openstax.org
stable, calm, and creative; and Cluster 3, which includes the Northeast, has more people who are stressed,
irritable, and depressed. People who live in Clusters 2 and 3 are also generally more open (Rentfrow et al.,
2013).
FIGURE 11.15 Researchers found three distinct regional personality clusters in the United States. People tend to be
friendly and conventional in the Upper Midwest and Deep South; relaxed, emotionally stable, and creative in the
West; and stressed, irritable, and depressed in the Northeast (Rentfrow et al., 2013).
One explanation for the regional differences is selective migration (Rentfrow et al., 2013). Selective migration
is the concept that people choose to move to places that are compatible with their personalities and needs. For
example, a person high on the agreeable scale would likely want to live near family and friends, and would
choose to settle or remain in such an area. In contrast, someone high on openness would prefer to settle in a
place that is recognized as diverse and innovative (such as California). Further, Rentfrow, Jost, Gosling, & Potter
(2009) noted an overlap between geographical regions and personality characteristics that goes beyond the
often-used explanations of religion, racial diversity, and education. Their research suggests that the
psychological profile of a region is closely related to that of its residents. They found that levels of openness
and conscientiousness in a state may predict voting patterns, indicating that there are correlations between
geographic regions and personality differences between liberals and conservatives relating to political views,
levels of economic vitality, and entrepreneurial rates.
Personality in Individualist and Collectivist Cultures
Individualist cultures and collectivist cultures place emphasis on different basic values. People who live in
individualist cultures tend to believe that independence, competition, and personal achievement are
important. Individuals in Western nations such as the United States, England, and Australia score high on
11.8 • Cultural Understandings of Personality 385
individualism (Oyserman, Coon, & Kemmelmier, 2002). People who live in collectivist cultures value social
harmony, respectfulness, and group needs over individual needs. Individuals who live in countries in Asia,
Africa, and South America score high on collectivism (Hofstede, 2001; Triandis, 1995). These values influence
personality. For example, Yang (2006) found that people in individualist cultures displayed more personally
oriented personality traits, whereas people in collectivist cultures displayed more socially oriented personality
traits. Frewer and Bleus (1991) conducted a study of the Eysenk Personality Inventory in a collectivist culture
using Papua New Guinean university students. They found that the results of the personality inventory were
only relevant when analyzed within the context of a collectivist society. Similarly, Dana (1986) suggested that
personality assessment services for Native Americans are often provided without a proper recognition of
culture-specific responses and a tribe-specific frame of reference. Assessors need to have more than a general
knowledge of history, tribal differences, contemporary culture on reservations, and levels of acculturation in
order to interpret psychological test responses with a minimal bias.
Approaches to Studying Personality in a Cultural Context
There are three approaches that can be used to study personality in a cultural context, the cultural-
comparative approach; the indigenous approach; and the combined approach, which incorporates elements of
both views. Since ideas about personality have a Western basis, the cultural-comparative approach seeks to
test Western ideas about personality in other cultures to determine whether they can be generalized and if
they have cultural validity (Cheung van de Vijver, & Leong, 2011). For example, recall from the previous section
on the trait perspective that researchers used the cultural-comparative approach to test the universality of
McCrae and Costa’s Five Factor Model. They found applicability in numerous cultures around the world, with
the Big Five factors being stable in many cultures (McCrae & Costa, 1997; McCrae et al., 2005). The indigenous
approach came about in reaction to the dominance of Western approaches to the study of personality in non-
Western settings (Cheung et al., 2011). Because Western-based personality assessments cannot fully capture
the personality constructs of other cultures, the indigenous model has led to the development of personality
assessment instruments that are based on constructs relevant to the culture being studied (Cheung et al.,
2011). The third approach to cross-cultural studies of personality is the combined approach, which serves as a
bridge between Western and indigenous psychology as a way of understanding both universal and cultural
variations in personality (Cheung et al., 2011).

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Discuss the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory
• Recognize and describe common projective tests used in personality assessment
Roberto, Mikhail, and Nat are college friends and all want to be police officers. Roberto is quiet and shy, lacks
self-confidence, and usually follows others. He is a kind person, but lacks motivation. Mikhail is loud and
boisterous, a leader. He works hard, but is impulsive and drinks too much on the weekends. Nat is thoughtful
and well liked. They are trustworthy, but are very methodical and therefore have difficulty making quick
decisions. Of these three, who would make the best police officer? What qualities and personality factors make
someone a good police officer? What makes someone a bad or dangerous police officer?
A police officer’s job is very high in stress, and law enforcement agencies want to make sure they hire the right
people. Personality testing is often used for this purpose—to screen applicants for employment and job
training. Personality tests are also used in criminal cases and custody battles, and to assess psychological
disorders. This section explores the best known among the many different types of personality tests.
Self-Report Inventories
Self-report inventories are a kind of objective test used to assess personality. They typically use multiple-
choice items or numbered scales, which represent a range from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).

Psychologists Hans and Sybil Eysenck were personality theorists (Figure 11.12) who focused on temperament, the inborn, genetically based personality differences that you studied earlier in the chapter. They believed personality is largely governed by biology. The Eysencks (Eysenck, 1990, 1992; Eysenck & Eysenck, 1963) viewed people as having two specific personality dimensions: extroversion/introversion and neuroticism/ stability. 380 11 • Personality Access for free at openstax.org FIGURE 11.12 Hans and Sybil Eysenck believed that our personality traits are influenced by our genetic inheritance. (credit: ""Sirswindon""/Wikimedia Commons) According to their theory, people high on the trait of extroversion are sociable and outgoing, and readily connect with others, whereas people high on the trait of introversion have a higher need to be alone, engage in solitary behaviors, and limit their interactions with others. In the neuroticism/stability dimension, people high on neuroticism tend to be anxious; they tend to have an overactive sympathetic nervous system and, even with low stress, their bodies and emotional state tend to go into a flight-or-fight reaction. In contrast, stable people tend to be less anxious and more relaxed. People with a high level of extraversion and low levels of anxiety are called extroverts, while people with high levels anxiety and a low need for social interaction are classified as introverts. Extroverted and introverted people differ from each other in a number of ways. For example, they differ in their attitudes toward stress. Introverts are more sensitive to stress and are less able to cope with stressful situations. They are also more likely to withdraw from social situations. On the other hand, extraverts are generally more tolerant of stress because they are not as easily overwhelmed by it. Extraverted individuals may be more prone to feeling stressed out, but they can also be better at coping with stress. In addition to these personality characteristics, there are several other traits that can be used to classify people into different personality types. Some of these traits include openness to experience, conscientiousness, agreeableness, and emotional stability. These traits can help you determine which personality type you are and how you can use your strengths and weaknesses to become a better person.

There are many different types of tests available, including personality inventories, personality questionnaires, self-report measures, behavioral measurements, etc. Each type of test has its own advantages and disadvantages, so it is important to choose a test that is appropriate for the job you want to apply for or the relationship you wish to establish. The most widely used personality test is the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). The MBTI was developed by Carl R. Jung, a Swiss psychiatrist, who was also the founder of the Jungian school of psychology. It was introduced to the United States by Carl Jung and his wife, Isabel Briggs Myers, as a way to help people understand themselves better.

12.7 Prosocial Behavior
On the night of February 26, 2012, Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old African American high
school student, was shot by a neighborhood watch volunteer, George Zimmerman, in a predominantly White
neighborhood. Zimmerman observed the boy dressed in a hoodie and pursued Martin. Zimmerman called the
police to report a person acting suspiciously, which he had done on other occasions. According to the 911 call
transcript, Zimmerman said on the call, ""[expletive] punks. These [expletive], they always get away."" The 911
operator told Zimmerman not to follow the teen, as was also stated in the police neighborhood watch
guidelines that had been provided to Zimmerman. A physical altercation ended with Zimmerman fatally
shooting Martin. Zimmerman claimed that he acted in self-defense. Martin was unarmed, and after his death,
there was a nationwide outcry. A Florida jury found Zimmerman not guilty of second degree murder nor of
manslaughter.
There have also been tragic situations with deadly consequences in which police officers have shot innocent
civilians. In 2019, Atatiana Jefferson's neighbor used a non-emergency line to call the police because
Jefferson's front door was open in the late hours of the night. The police arrived and an officer went to the back
of the yard. Jefferson, not knowing that the police had been called, reached into her purse and got out her
legally owned gun. The officer perceived a threat and fired upon Jefferson, killing her. Her 8-year-old nephew

witnessed the incident, as he was playing video games with his aunt. Why did each of these nights end so
tragically for those involved? What dynamics contributed to the outcomes? How can these deaths be
prevented?
Social psychologists examine how the presence of others impacts how a person behaves and reacts, whether
that person is an athlete playing a game, a police officer on the job, or a worshiper attending a religious service.
Social psychologists believe that a person's behavior is influenced by who else is present in a given situation
and the composition of social groups.
12.1 What Is Social Psychology?
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Define social psychology
• Describe situational versus dispositional influences on behavior
• Describe the fundamental attribution error
• Explain actor-observer bias
• Describe self-serving bias
• Explain the just-world hypothesis
Social psychology examines how people affect one another, and it looks at the power of the situation.
According to the American Psychological Association (n.d.), social psychologists ""are interested in all aspects
of personality and social interaction, exploring the influence of interpersonal and group relationships on
human behavior."" Throughout this chapter, we will examine how the presence of other individuals and groups
of people impacts a person's behaviors, thoughts, and feelings. Essentially, people will change their behavior to
align with the social situation at hand. If we are in a new situation or are unsure how to behave, we will take our
cues from other individuals.
The field of social psychology studies topics at both the intra- and interpersonal levels. Intrapersonal topics
(those that pertain to the individual) include emotions and attitudes, the self, and social cognition (the ways in
which we think about ourselves and others). Interpersonal topics (those that pertain to dyads and groups)
include helping behavior (Figure 12.2), aggression, prejudice and discrimination, attraction and close
relationships, and group processes and intergroup relationships.
FIGURE 12.2 Social psychology deals with all kinds of interactions between people, spanning a wide range of how
we connect: from moments of confrontation to moments of working together and helping others, as shown here.
(credit: Sgt. Derec Pierson, U.S. Army)
Social psychologists focus on how people conceptualize and interpret situations and how these interpretations
influence their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors (Ross & Nisbett, 1991). Thus, social psychology studies
individuals in a social context and how situational variables interact to influence behavior. In this chapter, we
discuss the intrapersonal processes of self-presentation, cognitive dissonance and attitude change, and the
400 12 • Social Psychology
Access for free at openstax.org
interpersonal processes of conformity and obedience, aggression and altruism, and, finally, love and
attraction.
Situational and Dispositional Influences on Behavior
Behavior is a product of both the situation (e.g., cultural influences, social roles, and the presence of
bystanders) and of the person (e.g., personality characteristics). Subfields of psychology tend to focus on one
influence or behavior over others. Situationism is the view that our behavior and actions are determined by
our immediate environment and surroundings. In contrast, dispositionism holds that our behavior is
determined by internal factors (Heider, 1958). An internal factor is an attribute of a person and includes
personality traits and temperament. Social psychologists have tended to take the situationist perspective,
whereas personality psychologists have promoted the dispositionist perspective. Modern approaches to social
psychology, however, take both the situation and the individual into account when studying human behavior
(Fiske, Gilbert, & Lindzey, 2010). In fact, the field of social-personality psychology has emerged to study the
complex interaction of internal and situational factors that affect human behavior (Mischel, 1977; Richard,
Bond, & Stokes-Zoota, 2003).
Fundamental Attribution Error
In the United States, the predominant culture tends to favor a dispositional approach in explaining human
behavior. Why do you think this is? We tend to think that people are in control of their own behaviors, and,
therefore, any behavior change must be due to something internal, such as their personality, habits, or
temperament. According to some social psychologists, people tend to overemphasize internal factors as
explanations—or attributions—for the behavior of other people. They tend to assume that the behavior of
another person is a trait of that person, and to underestimate the power of the situation on the behavior of
others. They tend to fail to recognize when the behavior of another is due to situational variables, and thus to
the person’s state. This erroneous assumption is called the fundamental attribution error (Ross, 1977; Riggio
& Garcia, 2009). To better understand, imagine this scenario: Jamie returns home from work, and opens the
front door to a happy greeting from spouse Morgan who inquires how the day has been. Instead of returning
the spouse’s kind greeting, Jamie yells, “Leave me alone!” Why did Jamie yell? How would someone
committing the fundamental attribution error explain Jamie’s behavior? The most common response is that
Jamie is a mean, angry, or unfriendly person (traits). This is an internal or dispositional explanation. However,
imagine that Jamie was just laid off from work due to company downsizing. Would your explanation for Jamie’s
behavior change? Your revised explanation might be that Jamie was frustrated and disappointed about being
laid off and was therefore in a bad mood (state). This is now an external or situational explanation for Jamie’s
behavior.
The fundamental attribution error is so powerful that people often overlook obvious situational influences on
behavior. A classic example was demonstrated in a series of experiments known as the quizmaster study (Ross,
Amabile, & Steinmetz, 1977). Student participants were randomly assigned to play the role of a questioner (the
quizmaster) or a contestant in a quiz game. Questioners developed difficult questions to which they knew the
answers, and they presented these questions to the contestants. The contestants answered the questions
correctly only 4 out of 10 times (Figure 12.3). After the task, the questioners and contestants were asked to rate
their own general knowledge compared to the average student. Questioners did not rate their general
knowledge higher than the contestants, but the contestants rated the questioners’ intelligence higher than
their own. In a second study, observers of the interaction also rated the questioner as having more general
knowledge than the contestant. The obvious influence on performance is the situation. The questioners wrote
the questions, so of course they had an advantage. Both the contestants and observers made an internal
attribution for the performance. They concluded that the questioners must be more intelligent than the
contestants.
12.1 • What Is Social Psychology? 401
FIGURE 12.3 In the quizmaster study, people tended to disregard the influence of the situation and wrongly
concluded that a questioner’s knowledge was greater than their own. (credit: Steve Jurvetson)
The halo effect refers to the tendency to let the overall impression of an individual color the way in which we
feel about their character. For instance, we might assume that people who are physically attractive are more
likely to be good people than less attractive individuals. Another example of how the halo effect might manifest
would involve assuming that someone whom we perceive to be outgoing or friendly has a better moral
character than someone who is not.
As demonstrated in the examples above, the fundamental attribution error is considered a powerful influence
in how we explain the behaviors of others. However, it should be noted that some researchers have suggested
that the fundamental attribution error may not be as powerful as it is often portrayed. In fact, a recent review
of more than 173 published studies suggests that several factors (e.g., high levels of idiosyncrasy of the
character and how well hypothetical events are explained) play a role in determining just how influential the
fundamental attribution error is (Malle, 2006).
Is the Fundamental Attribution Error a Universal Phenomenon?
You may be able to think of examples of the fundamental attribution error in your life. Do people in all cultures
commit the fundamental attribution error? Research suggests that they do not. People from an individualistic
culture, that is, a culture that focuses on individual achievement and autonomy, have the greatest tendency to
commit the fundamental attribution error. Individualistic cultures, which tend to be found in western
countries such as the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, promote a focus on the individual.
Therefore, a person’s disposition is thought to be the primary explanation for her behavior. In contrast, people
from a collectivistic culture, that is, a culture that focuses on communal relationships with others, such as
family, friends, and community (Figure 12.4), are less likely to commit the fundamental attribution error
(Markus & Kitayama, 1991; Triandis, 2001).
FIGURE 12.4 People from collectivistic cultures, such as some Asian cultures, are more likely to emphasize
relationships with others than to focus primarily on the individual. Activities such as (a) preparing a meal, (b)
hanging out, and (c) playing a game engage people in a group. (credit a: modification of work by Arian Zwegers;
credit b: modification of work by ""conbon33""/Flickr; credit c: modification of work by Anja Disseldorp)
Why do you think this is the case? Collectivistic cultures, which tend to be found in east Asian countries and in
Latin American and African countries, focus on the group more than on the individual (Nisbett, Peng, Choi, &

Summary
12.1 What Is Social Psychology?
Social psychology is the subfield of psychology that studies the power of the situation to influence individuals’
thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Psychologists categorize the causes of human behavior as those due to
internal factors, such as personality, or those due to external factors, such as cultural and other social
influences. Behavior is better explained, however, by using both approaches. Lay people tend to over-rely on
dispositional explanations for behavior and ignore the power of situational influences, a perspective called the
fundamental attribution error. People from individualistic cultures are more likely to display this bias versus
people from collectivistic cultures. Our explanations for our own and others behaviors can be biased due to not
having enough information about others’ motivations for behaviors and by providing explanations that bolster
our self-esteem.
12.2 Self-presentation
Human behavior is largely influenced by our social roles, norms, and scripts. In order to know how to act in a
given situation, we have shared cultural knowledge of how to behave depending on our role in society. Social
norms dictate the behavior that is appropriate or inappropriate for each role. Each social role has scripts that
help humans learn the sequence of appropriate behaviors in a given setting. The famous Stanford prison
experiment is an example of how the power of the situation can dictate the social roles, norms, and scripts we
follow in a given situation, even if this behavior is contrary to our typical behavior.
12.3 Attitudes and Persuasion
Attitudes are our evaluations or feelings toward a person, idea, or object and typically are positive or negative.
Our attitudes and beliefs are influenced not only by external forces, but also by internal influences that we
control. An internal form of attitude change is cognitive dissonance or the tension we experience when our
thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are in conflict. In order to reduce dissonance, individuals can change their
behavior, attitudes, or cognitions, or add a new cognition. External forces of persuasion include advertising;
the features of advertising that influence our behaviors include the source, message, and audience. There are
two primary routes to persuasion. The central route to persuasion uses facts and information to persuade
potential consumers. The peripheral route uses positive association with cues such as beauty, fame, and
positive emotions.
12.4 Conformity, Compliance, and Obedience
The power of the situation can lead people to conform, or go along with the group, even in the face of
inaccurate information. Conformity to group norms is driven by two motivations, the desire to fit in and be
liked and the desire to be accurate and gain information from the group. Authority figures also have influence
over our behaviors, and many people become obedient and follow orders even if the orders are contrary to
their personal values. Conformity to group pressures can also result in groupthink, or the faulty decision-
making process that results from cohesive group members trying to maintain group harmony. Group
situations can improve human behavior through facilitating performance on easy tasks, but inhibiting
performance on difficult tasks. The presence of others can also lead to social loafing when individual efforts
cannot be evaluated.
12.5 Prejudice and Discrimination
As diverse individuals, humans can experience conflict when interacting with people who are different from
each other. Prejudice, or negative feelings and evaluations, is common when people are from a different social
group (i.e., out-group). Negative attitudes toward out-groups can lead to discrimination. Prejudice and
discrimination against others can be based on gender, race, ethnicity, social class, sexual orientation, or a
variety of other social identities. In-group’s who feel threatened may blame the out-groups for their plight, thus
using the out-group as a scapegoat for their frustration.
12 • Summary 439
12.6 Aggression
Aggression is seeking to cause another person harm or pain. Hostile aggression is motivated by feelings of
anger with intent to cause pain, and instrumental aggression is motivated by achieving a goal and does not
necessarily involve intent to cause pain Bullying is an international public health concern that largely affects
the adolescent population. Bullying is repeated behaviors that are intended to inflict harm on the victim and
can take the form of physical, psychological, emotional, or social abuse. Bullying has negative mental health
consequences for youth including suicide. Cyberbullying is a newer form of bullying that takes place in an
online environment where bullies can remain anonymous and victims are helpless to address the harassment.
Despite the social norm of helping others in need, when there are many bystanders witnessing an emergency,
diffusion of responsibility will lead to a lower likelihood of any one person helping.
12.7 Prosocial Behavior
Altruism is a pure form of helping others out of empathy, which can be contrasted with egoistic motivations for
helping. Forming relationships with others is a necessity for social beings. We typically form relationships with
people who are close to us in proximity and people with whom we share similarities. We expect reciprocity and
self-disclosure in our relationships. We also want to form relationships with people who are physically
attractive, though standards for attractiveness vary by culture and gender. There are many types of love that
are determined by various combinations of intimacy, passion, and commitment; consummate love, which is
the ideal form of love, contains all three components. When determining satisfaction and whether to maintain
a relationship, individuals often use a social exchange approach and weigh the costs and benefits of forming
and maintaining a relationship.

Social Psychology
Social psychology focuses on how we interact with and relate to others. Social psychologists conduct research
on a wide variety of topics that include differences in how we explain our own behavior versus how we explain
the behaviors of others, prejudice, and attraction, and how we resolve interpersonal conflicts. Social
psychologists have also sought to determine how being among other people changes our own behavior and
patterns of thinking.
There are many interesting examples of social psychological research, and you will read about many of these
in a later chapter of this textbook. Until then, you will be introduced to one of the most controversial
psychological studies ever conducted. Stanley Milgram was an American social psychologist who is most
famous for research that he conducted on obedience. After the holocaust, in 1961, a Nazi war criminal, Adolf
Eichmann, who was accused of committing mass atrocities, was put on trial. Many people wondered how
German soldiers were capable of torturing prisoners in concentration camps, and they were unsatisfied with
the excuses given by soldiers that they were simply following orders. At the time, most psychologists agreed
that few people would be willing to inflict such extraordinary pain and suffering, simply because they were
obeying orders. Milgram decided to conduct research to determine whether or not this was true (Figure 1.14).
As you will read later in the text, Milgram found that nearly two-thirds of his participants were willing to
deliver what they believed to be lethal shocks to another person, simply because they were instructed to do so
by an authority figure (in this case, a man dressed in a lab coat). This was in spite of the fact that participants
1.3 • Contemporary Psychology 23
received payment for simply showing up for the research study and could have chosen not to inflict pain or
more serious consequences on another person by withdrawing from the study. No one was actually hurt or
harmed in any way, Milgram’s experiment was a clever ruse that took advantage of research confederates,
those who pretend to be participants in a research study who are actually working for the researcher and have
clear, specific directions on how to behave during the research study (Hock, 2009). Milgram’s and others’
studies that involved deception and potential emotional harm to study participants catalyzed the development
of ethical guidelines for conducting psychological research that discourage the use of deception of research
subjects, unless it can be argued not to cause harm and, in general, requiring informed consent of
participants.
FIGURE 1.14 Stanley Milgram’s research demonstrated just how far people will go in obeying orders from an
authority figure. This advertisement was used to recruit subjects for his research.
Industrial-Organizational Psychology
Industrial-Organizational psychology (I-O psychology) is a subfield of psychology that applies psychological
theories, principles, and research findings in industrial and organizational settings. I-O psychologists are often
involved in issues related to personnel management, organizational structure, and workplace environment.
Businesses often seek the aid of I-O psychologists to make the best hiring decisions as well as to create an
environment that results in high levels of employee productivity and efficiency. In addition to its applied
nature, I-O psychology also involves conducting scientific research on behavior within I-O settings (Riggio,
2013).

Health Psychology
Health psychology focuses on how health is affected by the interaction of biological, psychological, and
sociocultural factors. This particular approach is known as the biopsychosocial model (Figure 1.15). Health
psychologists are interested in helping individuals achieve better health through public policy, education,
intervention, and research. Health psychologists might conduct research that explores the relationship
between one’s genetic makeup, patterns of behavior, relationships, psychological stress, and health. They may
research effective ways to motivate people to address patterns of behavior that contribute to poorer health
(MacDonald, 2013).
FIGURE 1.15 The biopsychosocial model suggests that health/illness is determined by an interaction of these three
factors.
Sport and Exercise Psychology
Researchers in sport and exercise psychology study the psychological aspects of sport performance,
including motivation and performance anxiety, and the effects of sport on mental and emotional wellbeing.
Research is also conducted on similar topics as they relate to physical exercise in general. The discipline also
includes topics that are broader than sport and exercise but that are related to interactions between mental
and physical performance under demanding conditions, such as fire fighting, military operations, artistic
performance, and surgery.
Clinical Psychology
Clinical psychology is the area of psychology that focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of psychological
disorders and other problematic patterns of behavior. As such, it is generally considered to be a more applied
area within psychology; however, some clinicians are also actively engaged in scientific research. Counseling
psychology is a similar discipline that focuses on emotional, social, vocational, and health-related outcomes in
individuals who are considered psychologically healthy.
As mentioned earlier, both Freud and Rogers provided perspectives that have been influential in shaping how
clinicians interact with people seeking psychotherapy. While aspects of the psychoanalytic theory are still
found among some of today’s therapists who are trained from a psychodynamic perspective, Roger’s ideas
about client-centered therapy have been especially influential in shaping how many clinicians operate.
Furthermore, both behaviorism and the cognitive revolution have shaped clinical practice in the forms of
behavioral therapy, cognitive therapy, and cognitive-behavioral therapy (Figure 1.16). Issues related to the
diagnosis and treatment of psychological disorders and problematic patterns of behavior will be discussed in
1.3 • Contemporary Psychology 25
detail in later chapters of this textbook.
FIGURE 1.16 Cognitive-behavioral therapists take cognitive processes and behaviors into account when providing
psychotherapy. This is one of several strategies that may be used by practicing clinical psychologists.
By far, this is the area of psychology that receives the most attention in popular media, and many people
mistakenly assume that all psychology is clinical psychology.
Forensic Psychology
Forensic psychology is a branch of psychology that deals questions of psychology as they arise in the context
of the justice system. For example, forensic psychologists (and forensic psychiatrists) will assess a person’s
competency to stand trial, assess the state of mind of a defendant, act as consultants on child custody cases,
consult on sentencing and treatment recommendations, and advise on issues such as eyewitness testimony
and children’s testimony (American Board of Forensic Psychology, 2014). In these capacities, they will typically
act as expert witnesses, called by either side in a court case to provide their research- or experience-based
opinions. As expert witnesses, forensic psychologists must have a good understanding of the law and provide
information in the context of the legal system rather than just within the realm of psychology. Forensic
psychologists are also used in the jury selection process and witness preparation. They may also be involved in
providing psychological treatment within the criminal justice system. Criminal profilers are a relatively small
proportion of psychologists that act as consultants to law enforcement.
1.4 Careers in Psychology
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Understand educational requirements for careers in academic settings
• Understand the demands of a career in an academic setting
• Understand career options outside of academic settings
Psychologists can work in many different places doing many different things. In general, anyone wishing to
continue a career in psychology at a 4-year institution of higher education will have to earn a doctoral degree
in psychology for some specialties and at least a master’s degree for others. In most areas of psychology, this
means earning a PhD in a relevant area of psychology. Literally, PhD refers to a doctor of philosophy degree,
but here, philosophy does not refer to the field of philosophy per se. Rather, philosophy in this context refers to
many different disciplinary perspectives that would be housed in a traditional college of liberal arts and
sciences.
The requirements to earn a PhD vary from country to country and even from school to school, but usually,
individuals earning this degree must complete a dissertation. A dissertation is essentially a long research
paper or bundled published articles describing research that was conducted as a part of the candidate’s
doctoral training. In the United States, a dissertation generally has to be defended before a committee of expert

reviewers before the degree is conferred (Figure 1.17).
FIGURE 1.17 Doctoral degrees are generally conferred in formal ceremonies involving special attire and rites.
(credit: Public Affairs Office Fort Wainwright)
Once someone earns a PhD, they may seek a faculty appointment at a college or university. Being on the faculty
of a college or university often involves dividing time between teaching, research, and service to the institution
and profession. The amount of time spent on each of these primary responsibilities varies dramatically from
school to school, and it is not uncommon for faculty to move from place to place in search of the best personal
fit among various academic environments. The previous section detailed some of the major areas that are
commonly represented in psychology departments around the country; thus, depending on the training
received, an individual could be anything from a biological psychologist to a clinical psychologist in an
academic setting (Figure 1.18).

16.5 The Sociocultural Model and Therapy Utilization
What comes to mind when you think about therapy for mental health issues? You might
picture someone lying on a couch talking about his childhood while the therapist sits and takes notes, à la
Sigmund Freud. But can you envision a therapy session in which someone is wearing virtual reality headgear
to conquer a fear of snakes?
In this chapter, you will see that approaches to therapy include both psychological and biological interventions,
all with the goal of alleviating distress. Because psychological problems can originate from various
sources—biology, genetics, childhood experiences, conditioning, and sociocultural influences—psychologists
have developed many different therapeutic techniques and approaches. The Ocean Therapy program shown in
Figure 16.1 uses multiple approaches to support the mental health of veterans in the group.
There are many misconceptions and assumptions about therapy and treatment. In the same way that mental
16Therapy and Treatment
health and psychological disorders are often misunderstood and may be discounted, seeking help for
problems can be a difficult and scary time for people. There is no one method that works for everyone, and
those seeking help are displaying strength and courage in their decision to address a highly stigmatized and
challenging issue. The goal of treatment is not to change whom a person is, but to address symptoms and/or
underlying conditions.
16.1 Mental Health Treatment: Past and Present
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Explain how people with psychological disorders have been treated throughout the ages
• Discuss deinstitutionalization
• Discuss the ways in which mental health services are delivered today
• Distinguish between voluntary and involuntary treatment
Before we explore the various approaches to therapy used today, let’s begin our study of therapy by looking at
how many people experience mental illness and how many receive treatment. According to the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services (2017), 18.9% of U.S. adults experienced mental illness in 2017.
For teens (ages 13–18), the rate is similar to that of adults, and for children ages 8–15, current estimates
suggest that approximately 13% experience mental illness in a given year (National Institute of Mental Health
[NIMH], 2017).
With many different treatment options available, approximately how many people receive mental health
treatment per year? According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA),
in 2017, 14.8% of adults received treatment for a mental health issue (NIMH, 2017). These percentages, shown
in Figure 16.2, reflect the number of adults who received care in inpatient and outpatient settings and/or used
prescription medication for psychological disorders.
FIGURE 16.2 The percentage of adults who received mental health treatment in 2004–2008 is shown. Adults
seeking treatment increased slightly from 2004 to 2008.
Children and adolescents also receive mental health services. The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) found that approximately half
(50.6%) of children with mental disorders had received treatment for their disorder within the past year
(NIMH, n.d.). However, there were some differences between treatment rates by category of disorder (Figure
16.3). For example, children with anxiety disorders were least likely to have received treatment in the past
year, while children with ADHD or a conduct disorder were more likely to receive treatment. Can you think of
some possible reasons for these differences in receiving treatment?

FIGURE 16.3 About one-third to one-half of U.S. adolescents (ages 8–15) with mental disorders receive treatment,
with behavior-related disorders more likely to be treated.
Considering the many forms of treatment for mental health disorders available today, how did these forms of
treatment emerge? Let’s take a look at the history of mental health treatment from the past (with some
questionable approaches in light of modern understanding of mental illness) to where we are today.
Treatment in the Past
For much of history, people with mental illness have been treated very poorly. It was believed that mental
illness was caused by demonic possession, witchcraft, or an angry god (Szasz, 1960). For example, in medieval
times, abnormal behaviors were viewed as a sign that a person was possessed by demons. If someone was
considered to be possessed, there were several forms of treatment to release spirits from the individual. The
most common treatment was exorcism, often conducted by priests or other religious figures: Incantations and
prayers were said over the person’s body, and they may have been given some medicinal drinks. Another form
of treatment for extreme cases of mental illness was trephining: A small hole was made in the afflicted
individual’s skull to release spirits from the body. Most people treated in this manner died. In addition to
exorcism and trephining, other practices involved execution or imprisonment of people with psychological
disorders. Still others were left to be homeless beggars. Generally speaking, most people who exhibited strange
behaviors were greatly misunderstood and treated cruelly. The prevailing theory of psychopathology in earlier
history was the idea that mental illness was the result of demonic possession by either an evil spirit or an evil
god because early beliefs incorrectly attributed all unexplainable phenomena to deities deemed either good or
evil.
From the late 1400s to the late 1600s, a common belief perpetuated by some religious organizations was that
some people made pacts with the devil and committed horrible acts, such as eating babies (Blumberg, 2007).
These people were considered to be witches and were tried and condemned by courts—they were often burned
at the stake. Worldwide, it is estimated that tens of thousands of mentally ill people were killed after being
accused of being witches or under the influence of witchcraft (Hemphill, 1966)
By the 18th century, people who were considered odd and unusual were placed in asylums (Figure 16.4).
Asylums were the first institutions created for the specific purpose of housing people with psychological
disorders, but the focus was ostracizing them from society rather than treating their disorders. Often these
people were kept in windowless dungeons, beaten, chained to their beds, and had little to no contact with
caregivers.

Stanley Milgram was an American social psychologist who is most famous for research that he conducted on obedience. After the holocaust, in 1961, a Nazi war criminal, Adolf Eichmann, who was accused of committing mass atrocities, was put on trial. Many people wondered how German soldiers were capable of torturing prisoners in concentration camps, and they were unsatisfied with the excuses given by soldiers that they were simply following orders. At the time, most psychologists agreed that few people would be willing to inflict such extraordinary pain and suffering, simply because they were obeying orders. Milgram decided to conduct research to determine whether or not this was true (Figure 1.14). As you will read later in the text, Milgram found that nearly two-thirds of his participants were willing to deliver what they believed to be lethal shocks to another person, simply because they were instructed to do so by an authority figure (in this case, a man dressed in a lab coat). This was in spite of the fact that participants 1.3 • Contemporary Psychology 23 received payment for simply showing up for the research study and could have chosen not to inflict pain or more serious consequences on another person by withdrawing from the study. No one was actually hurt or harmed in any way, Milgram’s experiment was a clever ruse that took advantage of people’s natural tendency to obey authority figures, even when it is not in their own best interest. This is a classic example of what is known as the social facilitation effect, which occurs when people are more likely to follow the instructions of another person when they believe they are being instructed by someone they trust. In other words, people are more inclined to conform to the behavior of a person they know and trust than they would if they believed that the person was telling them something they did not want to hear. In this chapter, we will learn more about how social psychology can help us understand and explain the behaviors of individuals and groups. We will also learn how to use this knowledge to make better decisions in our personal and professional lives. 2.2 • Social Psychology in Everyday Life You may have heard the term “social psychology” before, but do you know what it means? Social psychology is a branch of psychology that studies how people behave in social situations, such as how they interact with each other and with their environment. It is an interdisciplinary field that draws on many different fields of study, including psychology, sociology, anthropology, history, economics, political science, education, and even business and marketing. The word “psychology” comes from two Greek words: “psyche,” which means “mind,” and “logos,” meaning “study.” Psychologists study the mind and behavior in order to better understand human behavior. They use a wide range of methods and techniques to collect and analyze data, as well as to design and conduct experiments to test their hypotheses. These methods include observation, questionnaires, surveys, interviews, descriptive statistics, correlational studies, experiments, psychometrics, neuropsychology, cognitive neuroscience, neuroimaging, brain imaging, behavioral genetics, genetic engineering, computer modeling, artificial intelligence, artificial neural networks, machine learning, robotics, virtual reality, augmented reality, human-computer interaction, natural language processing, computational linguistics, social network analysis, big data analytics, data mining, information retrieval, knowledge discovery, pattern recognition, expert systems, fuzzy logic, neural network theory, evolutionary biology, molecular biology, genomics, epigenetics, bioinformatics, genomics informatics, protein structure prediction, structural biomolecular modeling, biomolecular simulation, biophysics, nanotechnology, quantum mechanics, quantum computing, condensed matter physics, solid state physics, 24 Chapter","{""sections"": [""Unknown"", ""Therapy and Treatment/Types of Treatment"", ""Psychological Research/Why Is Research Important?""], ""pages"": [""635"", ""611"", ""37""]}"

1.4 Careers in Psychology
Clive Wearing is an accomplished musician who lost his ability to form new memories when
he became sick at the age of 46. While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember
what he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is
associated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend’s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John
Nash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would
tell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended
for him. He also began to hear voices and became suspicious of the people around him. Soon thereafter, Nash
was diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a state-run mental institution (O’Connor & Robertson,
1Introduction to Psychology
2002). Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these
experiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain’s internal
processes and people’s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of
psychology has explored these questions.
1.1 What Is Psychology?
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Define psychology
• Understand the merits of an education in psychology
What is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology
explores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists
use the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question
about how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the
phenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or
group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over
time. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes
observations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then
published or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.
Scientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because
it is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We
must ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However,
we can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus,
psychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.
In general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot
arrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the
mind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific
method is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on
observation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or
previous authorities.
It was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this
time, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is,
at its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological
organism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore,
psychology is also a social science.
WHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?
Often, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to
learn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course
because it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as
nursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare
psychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses
across the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology
majors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook’s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality
and political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About
6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S.
Department of Education, 2016).

An education in psychology is valuable for a number of reasons. Psychology students hone critical thinking
skills and are trained in the use of the scientific method. Critical thinking is the active application of a set of
skills to information for the understanding and evaluation of that information. The evaluation of
information—assessing its reliability and usefulness— is an important skill in a world full of competing “facts,”
many of which are designed to be misleading. For example, critical thinking involves maintaining an attitude
of skepticism, recognizing internal biases, making use of logical thinking, asking appropriate questions, and
making observations. Psychology students also can develop better communication skills during the course of
their undergraduate coursework (American Psychological Association, 2011). Together, these factors increase
students’ scientific literacy and prepare students to critically evaluate the various sources of information they
encounter.
In addition to these broad-based skills, psychology students come to understand the complex factors that
shape one’s behavior. They appreciate the interaction of our biology, our environment, and our experiences in
determining who we are and how we will behave. They learn about basic principles that guide how we think
and behave, and they come to recognize the tremendous diversity that exists across individuals and across
cultural boundaries (American Psychological Association, 2011).

1.2 History of Psychology
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Understand the importance of Wundt and James in the development of psychology
• Appreciate Freud’s influence on psychology
• Understand the basic tenets of Gestalt psychology
• Appreciate the important role that behaviorism played in psychology’s history
• Understand basic tenets of humanism
• Understand how the cognitive revolution shifted psychology’s focus back to the mind
Psychology is a relatively young science with its experimental roots in the 19th century, compared, for
example, to human physiology, which dates much earlier. As mentioned, anyone interested in exploring issues
related to the mind generally did so in a philosophical context prior to the 19th century. Two 19th century
scholars, Wilhelm Wundt and William James, are generally credited as being the founders of psychology as a
science and academic discipline that was distinct from philosophy. This section will provide an overview of the
shifts in paradigms that have influenced psychology from Wundt and James through today.
Wundt and Structuralism
Wilhelm Wundt (1832–1920) was a German scientist who was the first person to be referred to as a
psychologist. His famous book entitled Principles of Physiological Psychology was published in 1873. Wundt
viewed psychology as a scientific study of conscious experience, and he believed that the goal of psychology
was to identify components of consciousness and how those components combined to result in our conscious
experience. Wundt used introspection (he called it “internal perception”), a process by which someone
examines their own conscious experience as objectively as possible, making the human mind like any other
aspect of nature that a scientist observed. He believed in the notion of voluntarism—that people have free will
and should know the intentions of a psychological experiment if they were participating (Danziger, 1980).
Wundt considered his version experimental introspection; he used instruments such as those that measured
reaction time. He also wrote Volkerpsychologie in 1904 in which he suggested that psychology should include
the study of culture, as it involves the study of people. Edward Titchener, one of his students, went on to
1.2 • History of Psychology 9
develop structuralism. Its focus was on the contents of mental processes rather than their function (Pickren &
Rutherford, 2010). Wundt established his psychology laboratory at the University at Leipzig in 1879 (Figure
1.2). In this laboratory, Wundt and his students conducted experiments on, for example, reaction times. A
subject, sometimes in a room isolated from the scientist, would receive a stimulus such as a light, image, or
sound. The subject’s reaction to the stimulus would be to push a button, and an apparatus would record the
time to reaction. Wundt could measure reaction time to one-thousandth of a second (Nicolas & Ferrand, 1999).
FIGURE 1.2 (a) Wilhelm Wundt is credited as one of the founders of psychology. He created the first laboratory for
psychological research. (b) This photo shows him seated and surrounded by fellow researchers and equipment in
his laboratory in Germany.
However, despite his efforts to train individuals in the process of introspection, this process remained highly
subjective, and there was very little agreement between individuals.
Functionalism
William James, John Dewey, and Charles Sanders Peirce helped establish functional psychology (Figure 1.3).
They accepted Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection and viewed this theory as an explanation of an
organism’s characteristics. Key to that theory is the idea that natural selection leads to organisms that are
adapted to their environment, including their behavior. Adaptation means that a trait of an organism has a
function for the survival and reproduction of the individual, because it has been naturally selected. As James
saw it, psychology’s purpose was to study the function of behavior in the world, and as such, his perspective
was known as functionalism. Functionalism focused on how mental activities helped an organism fit into its
environment. Functionalism has a second, more subtle meaning in that functionalists were more interested in
the operation of the whole mind rather than of its individual parts, which were the focus of structuralism. Like
Wundt, James believed that introspection could serve as one means by which someone might study mental
activities, but James also relied on more objective measures, including the use of various recording devices,
and examinations of concrete products of mental activities and of anatomy and physiology (Gordon, 1995).

An education in psychology is valuable for a number of reasons. Psychology students hone critical thinking
skills and are trained in the use of the scientific method. Critical thinking is the active application of a set of
skills to information for the understanding and evaluation of that information. The evaluation of
information—assessing its reliability and usefulness— is an important skill in a world full of competing “facts,”
many of which are designed to be misleading. For example, critical thinking involves maintaining an attitude
of skepticism, recognizing internal biases, making use of logical thinking, asking appropriate questions, and
making observations. Psychology students also can develop better communication skills during the course of
their undergraduate coursework (American Psychological Association, 2011). Together, these factors increase
students’ scientific literacy and prepare students to critically evaluate the various sources of information they
encounter.
In addition to these broad-based skills, psychology students come to understand the complex factors that
shape one’s behavior. They appreciate the interaction of our biology, our environment, and our experiences in
determining who we are and how we will behave. They learn about basic principles that guide how we think
and behave, and they come to recognize the tremendous diversity that exists across individuals and across
cultural boundaries (American Psychological Association, 2011).

1.2 History of Psychology
LEARNING OBJECTIVES

• Understand the importance of Wundt and James in the development of psychology
• Appreciate Freud’s influence on psychology
• Understand the basic tenets of Gestalt psychology
• Appreciate the important role that behaviorism played in psychology’s history
• Understand basic tenets of humanism
• Understand how the cognitive revolution shifted psychology’s focus back to the mind
Psychology is a relatively young science with its experimental roots in the 19th century, compared, for
example, to human physiology, which dates much earlier. As mentioned, anyone interested in exploring issues
related to the mind generally did so in a philosophical context prior to the 19th century. Two 19th century
scholars, Wilhelm Wundt and William James, are generally credited as being the founders of psychology as a
science and academic discipline that was distinct from philosophy. This section will provide an overview of the
shifts in paradigms that have influenced psychology from Wundt and James through today.
Wundt and Structuralism
Wilhelm Wundt (1832–1920) was a German scientist who was the first person to be referred to as a
psychologist. His famous book entitled Principles of Physiological Psychology was published in 1873. Wundt
viewed psychology as a scientific study of conscious experience, and he believed that the goal of psychology
was to identify components of consciousness and how those components combined to result in our conscious
experience. Wundt used introspection (he called it “internal perception”), a process by which someone
examines their own conscious experience as objectively as possible, making the human mind like any other
aspect of nature that a scientist observed. He believed in the notion of voluntarism—that people have free will
and should know the intentions of a psychological experiment if they were participating (Danziger, 1980).
Wundt considered his version experimental introspection; he used instruments such as those that measured
reaction time. He also wrote Volkerpsychologie in 1904 in which he suggested that psychology should include
the study of culture, as it involves the study of people. Edward Titchener, one of his students, went on to
1.2 • History of Psychology 9
develop structuralism. Its focus was on the contents of mental processes rather than their function (Pickren &
Rutherford, 2010). Wundt established his psychology laboratory at the University at Leipzig in 1879 (Figure
1.2). In this laboratory, Wundt and his students conducted experiments on, for example, reaction times. A
subject, sometimes in a room isolated from the scientist, would receive a stimulus such as a light, image, or
sound. The subject’s reaction to the stimulus would be to push a button, and an apparatus would record the
time to reaction. Wundt could measure reaction time to one-thousandth of a second (Nicolas & Ferrand, 1999).
FIGURE 1.2 (a) Wilhelm Wundt is credited as one of the founders of psychology. He created the first laboratory for
psychological research. (b) This photo shows him seated and surrounded by fellow researchers and equipment in
his laboratory in Germany.
However, despite his efforts to train individuals in the process of introspection, this process remained highly
subjective, and there was very little agreement between individuals.
Functionalism
William James, John Dewey, and Charles Sanders Peirce helped establish functional psychology (Figure 1.3).
They accepted Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection and viewed this theory as an explanation of an
organism’s characteristics. Key to that theory is the idea that natural selection leads to organisms that are
adapted to their environment, including their behavior. Adaptation means that a trait of an organism has a
function for the survival and reproduction of the individual, because it has been naturally selected. As James
saw it, psychology’s purpose was to study the function of behavior in the world, and as such, his perspective
was known as functionalism. Functionalism focused on how mental activities helped an organism fit into its
environment. Functionalism has a second, more subtle meaning in that functionalists were more interested in
the operation of the whole mind rather than of its individual parts, which were the focus of structuralism. Like
Wundt, James believed that introspection could serve as one means by which someone might study mental
activities, but James also relied on more objective measures, including the use of various recording devices,
and examinations of concrete products of mental activities and of anatomy and physiology (Gordon, 1995).

FIGURE 1.3 William James, shown here in a self-portrait, was the first American psychologist.
Freud and Psychoanalytic Theory
Perhaps one of the most influential and well-known figures in psychology’s history was Sigmund Freud (Figure
1.4). Freud (1856–1939) was an Austrian neurologist who was fascinated by patients suffering from “hysteria”
and neurosis. Hysteria was an ancient diagnosis for disorders, primarily of women with a wide variety of
symptoms, including physical symptoms and emotional disturbances, none of which had an apparent physical
cause. Freud theorized that many of his patients’ problems arose from the unconscious mind. In Freud’s view,
the unconscious mind was a repository of feelings and urges of which we have no awareness. Gaining access to
the unconscious, then, was crucial to the successful resolution of the patient’s problems. According to Freud,
the unconscious mind could be accessed through dream analysis, by examinations of the first words that came
to people’s minds, and through seemingly innocent slips of the tongue. Psychoanalytic theory focuses on the
role of a person’s unconscious, as well as early childhood experiences, and this particular perspective
dominated clinical psychology for several decades (Thorne & Henley, 2005).
FIGURE 1.4 (a) Sigmund Freud was a highly influential figure in the history of psychology. (b) One of his many
books, A General Introduction to Psychoanalysis, shared his ideas about psychoanalytical therapy; it was published
in 1922.
Freud’s ideas were influential, and you will learn more about them when you study lifespan development,
personality, and therapy. For instance, many therapists believe strongly in the unconscious and the impact of
1.2 • History of Psychology 11
early childhood experiences on the rest of a person’s life. The method of psychoanalysis, which involves the
patient talking about their experiences and selves, while not invented by Freud, was certainly popularized by
him and is still used today. Many of Freud’s other ideas, however, are controversial. Drew Westen (1998) argues
that many of the criticisms of Freud’s ideas are misplaced, in that they attack his older ideas without taking
into account later writings. Westen also argues that critics fail to consider the success of the broad ideas that
Freud introduced or developed, such as the importance of childhood experiences in adult motivations, the role
of unconscious versus conscious motivations in driving our behavior, the fact that motivations can cause
conflicts that affect behavior, the effects of mental representations of ourselves and others in guiding our
interactions, and the development of personality over time. Westen identifies subsequent research support for
all of these ideas.
More modern iterations of Freud’s clinical approach have been empirically demonstrated to be effective (Knekt
et al., 2008; Shedler, 2010). Some current practices in psychotherapy involve examining unconscious aspects
of the self and relationships, often through the relationship between the therapist and the client. Freud’s
historical significance and contributions to clinical practice merit his inclusion in a discussion of the historical
movements within psychology.
Wertheimer, Koffka, Köhler, and Gestalt Psychology
Max Wertheimer (1880–1943), Kurt Koffka (1886–1941), and Wolfgang Köhler (1887–1967) were three
German psychologists who immigrated to the United States in the early 20th century to escape Nazi Germany.
These scholars are credited with introducing psychologists in the United States to various Gestalt principles.
The word Gestalt roughly translates to “whole;” a major emphasis of Gestalt psychology deals with the fact that
although a sensory experience can be broken down into individual parts, how those parts relate to each other
as a whole is often what the individual responds to in perception. For example, a song may be made up of
individual notes played by different instruments, but the real nature of the song is perceived in the
combinations of these notes as they form the melody, rhythm, and harmony. In many ways, this particular
perspective would have directly contradicted Wundt’s ideas of structuralism (Thorne & Henley, 2005).
Unfortunately, in moving to the United States, these scientists were forced to abandon much of their work and
were unable to continue to conduct research on a large scale. These factors along with the rise of behaviorism
(described next) in the United States prevented principles of Gestalt psychology from being as influential in
the United States as they had been in their native Germany (Thorne & Henley, 2005). Despite these issues,
several Gestalt principles are still very influential today. Considering the human individual as a whole rather
than as a sum of individually measured parts became an important foundation in humanistic theory late in the
century. The ideas of Gestalt have continued to influence research on sensation and perception.
Structuralism, Freud, and the Gestalt psychologists were all concerned in one way or another with describing
and understanding inner experience. But other researchers had concerns that inner experience could be a
legitimate subject of scientific inquiry and chose instead to exclusively study behavior, the objectively
observable outcome of mental processes.
Pavlov, Watson, Skinner, and Behaviorism
Early work in the field of behavior was conducted by the Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov (1849–1936). Pavlov
studied a form of learning behavior called a conditioned reflex, in which an animal or human produced a
reflex (unconscious) response to a stimulus and, over time, was conditioned to produce the response to a
different stimulus that the experimenter associated with the original stimulus. The reflex Pavlov worked with
was salivation in response to the presence of food. The salivation reflex could be elicited using a second
stimulus, such as a specific sound, that was presented in association with the initial food stimulus several
times. Once the response to the second stimulus was “learned,” the food stimulus could be omitted. Pavlov’s
“classical conditioning” is only one form of learning behavior studied by behaviorists.
John B. Watson (1878–1958) was an influential American psychologist whose most famous work occurred

11.1 What Is Personality?
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Define personality
• Describe early theories about personality development
Personality refers to the long-standing traits and patterns that propel individuals to consistently think, feel,
and behave in specific ways. Our personality is what makes us unique individuals. Each person has an
idiosyncratic pattern of enduring, long-term characteristics and a manner in which they interact with other
individuals and the world around them. Our personalities are thought to be long term, stable, and not easily
changed. The word personality comes from the Latin word persona. In the ancient world, a persona was a
mask worn by an actor. While we tend to think of a mask as being worn to conceal one’s identity, the theatrical
mask was originally used to either represent or project a specific personality trait of a character (Figure 11.2).
FIGURE 11.2 Happy, sad, impatient, shy, fearful, curious, helpful. What characteristics describe your personality?
Historical Perspectives
The concept of personality has been studied for at least 2,000 years, beginning with Hippocrates in 370 BCE
(Fazeli, 2012). Hippocrates theorized that personality traits and human behaviors are based on four separate
temperaments associated with four fluids (“humors”) of the body: choleric temperament (yellow bile from the
liver), melancholic temperament (black bile from the kidneys), sanguine temperament (red blood from the
heart), and phlegmatic temperament (white phlegm from the lungs) (Clark & Watson, 2008; Eysenck &
Eysenck, 1985; Lecci & Magnavita, 2013; Noga, 2007). Centuries later, the influential Greek physician and
philosopher Galen built on Hippocrates’s theory, suggesting that both diseases and personality differences
could be explained by imbalances in the humors and that each person exhibits one of the four temperaments.
For example, the choleric person is passionate, ambitious, and bold; the melancholic person is reserved,
anxious, and unhappy; the sanguine person is joyful, eager, and optimistic; and the phlegmatic person is calm,
reliable, and thoughtful (Clark & Watson, 2008; Stelmack & Stalikas, 1991). Galen’s theory was prevalent for
over 1,000 years and continued to be popular through the Middle Ages.
In 1780, Franz Gall, a German physician, proposed that the distances between bumps on the skull reveal a
person’s personality traits, character, and mental abilities (Figure 11.3). According to Gall, measuring these
distances revealed the sizes of the brain areas underneath, providing information that could be used to
determine whether a person was friendly, prideful, murderous, kind, good with languages, and so on. Initially,
phrenology was very popular; however, it was soon discredited for lack of empirical support and has long been
relegated to the status of pseudoscience (Fancher, 1979).

characteristics (Hothersall, 1995). (b) An 1825 lithograph depicts Gall examining the skull of a young woman. (credit

In the centuries after Galen, other researchers contributed to the development of his four primary
temperament types, most prominently Immanuel Kant (in the 18th century) and psychologist Wilhelm Wundt
(in the 19th century) (Eysenck, 2009; Stelmack & Stalikas, 1991; Wundt, 1874/1886) (Figure 11.4). Kant agreed
with Galen that everyone could be sorted into one of the four temperaments and that there was no overlap
between the four categories (Eysenck, 2009). He developed a list of traits that could be used to describe the
personality of a person from each of the four temperaments. However, Wundt suggested that a better
description of personality could be achieved using two major axes: emotional/nonemotional and changeable/
unchangeable. The first axis separated strong from weak emotions (the melancholic and choleric
temperaments from the phlegmatic and sanguine). The second axis divided the changeable temperaments
(choleric and sanguine) from the unchangeable ones (melancholic and phlegmatic) (Eysenck, 2009).
11.1 • What Is Personality? 361
FIGURE 11.4 Developed from Galen’s theory of the four temperaments, Kant proposed trait words to describe each
temperament. Wundt later suggested the arrangement of the traits on two major axes.
Sigmund Freud’s psychodynamic perspective of personality was the first comprehensive theory of personality,
explaining a wide variety of both normal and abnormal behaviors. According to Freud, unconscious drives
influenced by sex and aggression, along with childhood sexuality, are the forces that influence our personality.
Freud attracted many followers who modified his ideas to create new theories about personality. These
theorists, referred to as neo-Freudians, generally agreed with Freud that childhood experiences matter, but
they reduced the emphasis on sex and focused more on the social environment and effects of culture on
personality. The perspective of personality proposed by Freud and his followers was the dominant theory of
personality for the first half of the 20th century.
Other major theories then emerged, including the learning, humanistic, biological, evolutionary, trait, and
cultural perspectives. In this chapter, we will explore these various perspectives on personality in depth.

us understand some of the controversy over his theories today. However, Freud was the first to systematically
study and theorize the workings of the unconscious mind in the manner that we associate with modern
psychology.
In the early years of his career, Freud worked with Josef Breuer, a Viennese physician. During this time, Freud
became intrigued by the story of one of Breuer’s patients, Bertha Pappenheim, who was referred to by the
pseudonym Anna O. (Launer, 2005). Anna O. had been caring for her dying father when she began to
experience symptoms such as partial paralysis, headaches, blurred vision, amnesia, and hallucinations
(Launer, 2005). In Freud’s day, these symptoms were commonly referred to as hysteria. Anna O. turned to
Breuer for help. He spent 2 years (1880–1882) treating Anna O. and discovered that allowing her to talk about
her experiences seemed to bring some relief of her symptoms. Anna O. called his treatment the “talking cure”
(Launer, 2005). Despite the fact that Freud never met Anna O., her story served as the basis for the 1895 book,
Studies on Hysteria, which he co-authored with Breuer. Based on Breuer’s description of Anna O.’s treatment,
Freud concluded that hysteria was the result of sexual abuse in childhood and that these traumatic
experiences had been hidden from consciousness. Breuer disagreed with Freud, which soon ended their work
together. However, Freud continued to work to refine talk therapy and build his theory on personality.
Levels of Consciousness
To explain the concept of conscious versus unconscious experience, Freud compared the mind to an iceberg
(Figure 11.5). He said that only about one-tenth of our mind is conscious, and the rest of our mind is
unconscious. Our unconscious refers to that mental activity of which we are unaware and are unable to access
(Freud, 1923). According to Freud, unacceptable urges and desires are kept in our unconscious through a
process called repression. For example, we sometimes say things that we don’t intend to say by unintentionally
substituting another word for the one we meant. You’ve probably heard of a Freudian slip, the term used to
describe this. Freud suggested that slips of the tongue are actually sexual or aggressive urges, accidentally
slipping out of our unconscious. Speech errors such as this are quite common. Seeing them as a reflection of
unconscious desires, linguists today have found that slips of the tongue tend to occur when we are tired,
nervous, or not at our optimal level of cognitive functioning (Motley, 2002).

James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is associated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend’s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John Nash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would tell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended for him. He also began to hear voices and became suspicious of the people around him. Soon thereafter, Nash was diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a state-run mental institution (O’Connor & Robertson, 1Introduction to Psychology 2002). Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these experiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain’s internal processes and people’s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of psychology has explored these questions. 1.1 What Is Psychology? LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you should be able to: • Define psychology • Describe the history of psychology and its current state of development The word psychology comes from two Greek words that mean “to think” and “mind.” The word is derived from the Greek word “psyche,” which means the mind or the soul, and the suffix “-logia,” meaning “study.” Psychology, then, refers to the science that studies the mental processes and behaviors of humans and other animals. In other words, psychologists study how people think, feel, learn, remember, think about themselves, think about the world around them, make decisions, solve problems, interact with others, etc. Psychologists also study mental disorders, such as depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and eating disorders. Psychologists use a variety of methods to study human behavior, including interviews, questionnaires, brain imaging, laboratory experiments, case studies, surveys, observation, self-report measures, clinical interviews, and more. These methods can be used in conjunction with one another to gather information about human behaviors. For example, a psychologist might use an interview to collect data about a person’s thoughts and feelings, but then use brain imaging to see how those thoughts are stored in the part of their brain called the hippocampus, which is involved in memory and decision-making. The psychologist can then compare the two types of data to determine whether or not the person has a mental disorder. There are many different subfields within psychology, each of which focuses on a particular type of behavior or mental process. Some of these sub-fields include the following: (1) developmental psychology; (2) neuropsychology; (3) psychopathology; and (4) social psychology. Developmental psychology is concerned with how children develop and change over time. This subfield focuses on the ways in which children learn and grow, as well as the factors that influence their development. Neuropsychologists are interested in how the nervous system works and how it is affected by disease or injury. They also study the relationship between brain structure and function. Finally, social psychologists focus on how human behavior is influenced by social and cultural factors. Social psychology studies how individuals and groups interact with each other and with their environment. It also looks at how these interactions affect individuals’ thoughts, feelings, beliefs, values, attitudes, behaviors, emotions, motivations","{""sections"": [""Introduction to Psychology/Contemporary Psychology"", ""Personality/Learning Approaches""], ""pages"": [""21"", ""22"", ""373""]}"

processes and people’s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of
psychology has explored these questions.
1.1 What Is Psychology?
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Define psychology
• Understand the merits of an education in psychology
What is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology
explores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists
use the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question
about how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the
phenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or
group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over
time. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes
observations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then
published or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.
Scientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because
it is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We
must ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However,
we can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus,
psychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.
In general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot
arrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the
mind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific
method is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on
observation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or
previous authorities.
It was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this
time, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is,
at its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological
organism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore,
psychology is also a social science.
WHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?
Often, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to
learn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course
because it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as
nursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare
psychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses
across the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology
majors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook’s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality
and political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About
6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S.
Department of Education, 2016).

An education in psychology is valuable for a number of reasons. Psychology students hone critical thinking
skills and are trained in the use of the scientific method. Critical thinking is the active application of a set of
skills to information for the understanding and evaluation of that information. The evaluation of
information—assessing its reliability and usefulness— is an important skill in a world full of competing “facts,”
many of which are designed to be misleading. For example, critical thinking involves maintaining an attitude
of skepticism, recognizing internal biases, making use of logical thinking, asking appropriate questions, and
making observations. Psychology students also can develop better communication skills during the course of
their undergraduate coursework (American Psychological Association, 2011). Together, these factors increase
students’ scientific literacy and prepare students to critically evaluate the various sources of information they
encounter.
In addition to these broad-based skills, psychology students come to understand the complex factors that
shape one’s behavior. They appreciate the interaction of our biology, our environment, and our experiences in
determining who we are and how we will behave. They learn about basic principles that guide how we think
and behave, and they come to recognize the tremendous diversity that exists across individuals and across
cultural boundaries (American Psychological Association, 2011).

• Appreciate Freud’s influence on psychology
• Understand the basic tenets of Gestalt psychology
• Appreciate the important role that behaviorism played in psychology’s history
• Understand basic tenets of humanism
• Understand how the cognitive revolution shifted psychology’s focus back to the mind
Psychology is a relatively young science with its experimental roots in the 19th century, compared, for
example, to human physiology, which dates much earlier. As mentioned, anyone interested in exploring issues
related to the mind generally did so in a philosophical context prior to the 19th century. Two 19th century
scholars, Wilhelm Wundt and William James, are generally credited as being the founders of psychology as a
science and academic discipline that was distinct from philosophy. This section will provide an overview of the
shifts in paradigms that have influenced psychology from Wundt and James through today.
Wundt and Structuralism
Wilhelm Wundt (1832–1920) was a German scientist who was the first person to be referred to as a
psychologist. His famous book entitled Principles of Physiological Psychology was published in 1873. Wundt
viewed psychology as a scientific study of conscious experience, and he believed that the goal of psychology
was to identify components of consciousness and how those components combined to result in our conscious
experience. Wundt used introspection (he called it “internal perception”), a process by which someone
examines their own conscious experience as objectively as possible, making the human mind like any other
aspect of nature that a scientist observed. He believed in the notion of voluntarism—that people have free will
and should know the intentions of a psychological experiment if they were participating (Danziger, 1980).
Wundt considered his version experimental introspection; he used instruments such as those that measured
reaction time. He also wrote Volkerpsychologie in 1904 in which he suggested that psychology should include
the study of culture, as it involves the study of people. Edward Titchener, one of his students, went on to
1.2 • History of Psychology 9
develop structuralism. Its focus was on the contents of mental processes rather than their function (Pickren &
Rutherford, 2010). Wundt established his psychology laboratory at the University at Leipzig in 1879 (Figure
1.2). In this laboratory, Wundt and his students conducted experiments on, for example, reaction times. A
subject, sometimes in a room isolated from the scientist, would receive a stimulus such as a light, image, or
sound. The subject’s reaction to the stimulus would be to push a button, and an apparatus would record the
time to reaction. Wundt could measure reaction time to one-thousandth of a second (Nicolas & Ferrand, 1999).
FIGURE 1.2 (a) Wilhelm Wundt is credited as one of the founders of psychology. He created the first laboratory for
psychological research. (b) This photo shows him seated and surrounded by fellow researchers and equipment in
his laboratory in Germany.
However, despite his efforts to train individuals in the process of introspection, this process remained highly
subjective, and there was very little agreement between individuals.
Functionalism
William James, John Dewey, and Charles Sanders Peirce helped establish functional psychology (Figure 1.3).
They accepted Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection and viewed this theory as an explanation of an
organism’s characteristics. Key to that theory is the idea that natural selection leads to organisms that are
adapted to their environment, including their behavior. Adaptation means that a trait of an organism has a
function for the survival and reproduction of the individual, because it has been naturally selected. As James
saw it, psychology’s purpose was to study the function of behavior in the world, and as such, his perspective
was known as functionalism. Functionalism focused on how mental activities helped an organism fit into its
environment. Functionalism has a second, more subtle meaning in that functionalists were more interested in
the operation of the whole mind rather than of its individual parts, which were the focus of structuralism. Like
Wundt, James believed that introspection could serve as one means by which someone might study mental
activities, but James also relied on more objective measures, including the use of various recording devices,
and examinations of concrete products of mental activities and of anatomy and physiology (Gordon, 1995).

Freud and Psychoanalytic Theory
Perhaps one of the most influential and well-known figures in psychology’s history was Sigmund Freud (Figure
1.4). Freud (1856–1939) was an Austrian neurologist who was fascinated by patients suffering from “hysteria”
and neurosis. Hysteria was an ancient diagnosis for disorders, primarily of women with a wide variety of
symptoms, including physical symptoms and emotional disturbances, none of which had an apparent physical
cause. Freud theorized that many of his patients’ problems arose from the unconscious mind. In Freud’s view,
the unconscious mind was a repository of feelings and urges of which we have no awareness. Gaining access to
the unconscious, then, was crucial to the successful resolution of the patient’s problems. According to Freud,
the unconscious mind could be accessed through dream analysis, by examinations of the first words that came
to people’s minds, and through seemingly innocent slips of the tongue. Psychoanalytic theory focuses on the
role of a person’s unconscious, as well as early childhood experiences, and this particular perspective
dominated clinical psychology for several decades (Thorne & Henley, 2005).
FIGURE 1.4 (a) Sigmund Freud was a highly influential figure in the history of psychology. (b) One of his many
books, A General Introduction to Psychoanalysis, shared his ideas about psychoanalytical therapy; it was published
in 1922.
Freud’s ideas were influential, and you will learn more about them when you study lifespan development,
personality, and therapy. For instance, many therapists believe strongly in the unconscious and the impact of
1.2 • History of Psychology 11
early childhood experiences on the rest of a person’s life. The method of psychoanalysis, which involves the
patient talking about their experiences and selves, while not invented by Freud, was certainly popularized by
him and is still used today. Many of Freud’s other ideas, however, are controversial. Drew Westen (1998) argues
that many of the criticisms of Freud’s ideas are misplaced, in that they attack his older ideas without taking
into account later writings. Westen also argues that critics fail to consider the success of the broad ideas that
Freud introduced or developed, such as the importance of childhood experiences in adult motivations, the role
of unconscious versus conscious motivations in driving our behavior, the fact that motivations can cause
conflicts that affect behavior, the effects of mental representations of ourselves and others in guiding our
interactions, and the development of personality over time. Westen identifies subsequent research support for
all of these ideas.
More modern iterations of Freud’s clinical approach have been empirically demonstrated to be effective (Knekt
et al., 2008; Shedler, 2010). Some current practices in psychotherapy involve examining unconscious aspects
of the self and relationships, often through the relationship between the therapist and the client. Freud’s
historical significance and contributions to clinical practice merit his inclusion in a discussion of the historical
movements within psychology.
Wertheimer, Koffka, Köhler, and Gestalt Psychology
Max Wertheimer (1880–1943), Kurt Koffka (1886–1941), and Wolfgang Köhler (1887–1967) were three
German psychologists who immigrated to the United States in the early 20th century to escape Nazi Germany.
These scholars are credited with introducing psychologists in the United States to various Gestalt principles.
The word Gestalt roughly translates to “whole;” a major emphasis of Gestalt psychology deals with the fact that
although a sensory experience can be broken down into individual parts, how those parts relate to each other
as a whole is often what the individual responds to in perception. For example, a song may be made up of
individual notes played by different instruments, but the real nature of the song is perceived in the
combinations of these notes as they form the melody, rhythm, and harmony. In many ways, this particular
perspective would have directly contradicted Wundt’s ideas of structuralism (Thorne & Henley, 2005).
Unfortunately, in moving to the United States, these scientists were forced to abandon much of their work and
were unable to continue to conduct research on a large scale. These factors along with the rise of behaviorism
(described next) in the United States prevented principles of Gestalt psychology from being as influential in
the United States as they had been in their native Germany (Thorne & Henley, 2005). Despite these issues,
several Gestalt principles are still very influential today. Considering the human individual as a whole rather
than as a sum of individually measured parts became an important foundation in humanistic theory late in the
century. The ideas of Gestalt have continued to influence research on sensation and perception.
Structuralism, Freud, and the Gestalt psychologists were all concerned in one way or another with describing
and understanding inner experience. But other researchers had concerns that inner experience could be a
legitimate subject of scientific inquiry and chose instead to exclusively study behavior, the objectively
observable outcome of mental processes.
Pavlov, Watson, Skinner, and Behaviorism
Early work in the field of behavior was conducted by the Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov (1849–1936). Pavlov
studied a form of learning behavior called a conditioned reflex, in which an animal or human produced a
reflex (unconscious) response to a stimulus and, over time, was conditioned to produce the response to a
different stimulus that the experimenter associated with the original stimulus. The reflex Pavlov worked with
was salivation in response to the presence of food. The salivation reflex could be elicited using a second
stimulus, such as a specific sound, that was presented in association with the initial food stimulus several
times. Once the response to the second stimulus was “learned,” the food stimulus could be omitted. Pavlov’s
“classical conditioning” is only one form of learning behavior studied by behaviorists.
John B. Watson (1878–1958) was an influential American psychologist whose most famous work occurred

4-year institutions and use these opportunities to gain experience in teaching. Furthermore, many 2-year
colleges and schools need faculty to teach their courses in psychology. In general, many of the people who
pursue careers at these institutions have master’s degrees in psychology, although some PhDs make careers at
these institutions as well.
Some people earning PhDs may enjoy research in an academic setting. However, they may not be interested in
teaching. These individuals might take on faculty positions that are exclusively devoted to conducting
research. This type of position would be more likely an option at large, research-focused universities.
In some areas in psychology, it is common for individuals who have recently earned their PhD to seek out
positions in postdoctoral training programs that are available before going on to serve as faculty. In most
cases, young scientists will complete one or two postdoctoral programs before applying for a full-time faculty
position. Postdoctoral training programs allow young scientists to further develop their research programs
and broaden their research skills under the supervision of other professionals in the field.
Career Options Outside of Academic Settings
Individuals who wish to become practicing clinical psychologists have another option for earning a doctoral
degree, which is known as a PsyD. A PsyD is a doctor of psychology degree that is increasingly popular among
individuals interested in pursuing careers in clinical psychology. PsyD programs generally place less emphasis
on research-oriented skills and focus more on application of psychological principles in the clinical context
(Norcross & Castle, 2002).
Regardless of whether earning a PhD or PsyD, in most states, an individual wishing to practice as a licensed
clinical or counseling psychologist may complete postdoctoral work under the supervision of a licensed
psychologist. Within the last few years, however, several states have begun to remove this requirement, which
would allow people to get an earlier start in their careers (Munsey, 2009). After an individual has met the state
requirements, their credentials are evaluated to determine whether they can sit for the licensure exam. Only
individuals that pass this exam can call themselves licensed clinical or counseling psychologists (Norcross,
n.d.). Licensed clinical or counseling psychologists can then work in a number of settings, ranging from private
clinical practice to hospital settings. It should be noted that clinical psychologists and psychiatrists do different
things and receive different types of education. While both can conduct therapy and counseling, clinical
psychologists have a PhD or a PsyD, whereas psychiatrists have a doctor of medicine degree (MD). As such,
licensed clinical psychologists can administer and interpret psychological tests, while psychiatrists can
prescribe medications.
Individuals earning a PhD can work in a variety of settings, depending on their areas of specialization. For
example, someone trained as a biopsychologist might work in a pharmaceutical company to help test the
efficacy of a new drug. Someone with a clinical background might become a forensic psychologist and work
within the legal system to make recommendations during criminal trials and parole hearings, or serve as an
expert in a court case.
While earning a doctoral degree in psychology is a lengthy process, usually taking between 5–6 years of
graduate study (DeAngelis, 2010), there are a number of careers that can be attained with a master’s degree in
psychology. People who wish to provide psychotherapy can become licensed to serve as various types of
professional counselors (Hoffman, 2012). Relevant master’s degrees are also sufficient for individuals seeking
careers as school psychologists (National Association of School Psychologists, n.d.), in some capacities related
to sport psychology (American Psychological Association, 2014), or as consultants in various industrial
settings (Landers, 2011, June 14). Undergraduate coursework in psychology may be applicable to other careers
such as psychiatric social work or psychiatric nursing, where assessments and therapy may be a part of the
job.
As mentioned in the opening section of this chapter, an undergraduate education in psychology is associated
with a knowledge base and skill set that many employers find quite attractive. It should come as no surprise,

then, that individuals earning bachelor’s degrees in psychology find themselves in a number of different
careers, as shown in Table 1.1. Examples of a few such careers can involve serving as case managers, working
in sales, working in human resource departments, and teaching in high schools. The rapidly growing realm of
healthcare professions is another field in which an education in psychology is helpful and sometimes required.
For example, the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) exam that people must take to be admitted to medical
school now includes a section on the psychological foundations of behavior.

Summary
1.1 What Is Psychology?
Psychology is defined as the scientific study of mind and behavior. Students of psychology develop critical
thinking skills, become familiar with the scientific method, and recognize the complexity of behavior.
1.2 History of Psychology
Before the time of Wundt and James, questions about the mind were considered by philosophers. However,
both Wundt and James helped create psychology as a distinct scientific discipline. Wundt was a structuralist,
which meant he believed that our cognitive experience was best understood by breaking that experience into
its component parts. He thought this was best accomplished by introspection.
30 1 • Key Terms

William James was the first American psychologist, and he was a proponent of functionalism. This particular
perspective focused on how mental activities served as adaptive responses to an organism’s environment. Like
Wundt, James also relied on introspection; however, his research approach also incorporated more objective
measures as well.
Sigmund Freud believed that understanding the unconscious mind was absolutely critical to understand
conscious behavior. This was especially true for individuals that he saw who suffered from various hysterias
and neuroses. Freud relied on dream analysis, slips of the tongue, and free association as means to access the
unconscious. Psychoanalytic theory remained a dominant force in clinical psychology for several decades.
Gestalt psychology was very influential in Europe. Gestalt psychology takes a holistic view of an individual and
his experiences. As the Nazis came to power in Germany, Wertheimer, Koffka, and Köhler immigrated to the
United States. Although they left their laboratories and their research behind, they did introduce America to
Gestalt ideas. Some of the principles of Gestalt psychology are still very influential in the study of sensation
and perception.
One of the most influential schools of thought within psychology’s history was behaviorism. Behaviorism
focused on making psychology an objective science by studying overt behavior and deemphasizing the
importance of unobservable mental processes. John Watson is often considered the father of behaviorism, and
B. F. Skinner’s contributions to our understanding of principles of operant conditioning cannot be
underestimated.
As behaviorism and psychoanalytic theory took hold of so many aspects of psychology, some began to become
dissatisfied with psychology’s picture of human nature. Thus, a humanistic movement within psychology
began to take hold. Humanism focuses on the potential of all people for good. Both Maslow and Rogers were
influential in shaping humanistic psychology.
During the 1950s, the landscape of psychology began to change. A science of behavior began to shift back to its
roots of focus on mental processes. The emergence of neuroscience and computer science aided this
transition. Ultimately, the cognitive revolution took hold, and people came to realize that cognition was crucial
to a true appreciation and understanding of behavior.
1.3 Contemporary Psychology
Psychology is a diverse discipline that is made up of several major subdivisions with unique perspectives.
Biological psychology involves the study of the biological bases of behavior. Sensation and perception refer to
the area of psychology that is focused on how information from our sensory modalities is received, and how
this information is transformed into our perceptual experiences of the world around us. Cognitive psychology
is concerned with the relationship that exists between thought and behavior, and developmental psychologists
study the physical and cognitive changes that occur throughout one’s lifespan. Personality psychology focuses
on individuals’ unique patterns of behavior, thought, and emotion. Industrial and organizational psychology,
health psychology, sport and exercise psychology, forensic psychology, and clinical psychology are all
considered applied areas of psychology. Industrial and organizational psychologists apply psychological
concepts to I-O settings. Health psychologists look for ways to help people live healthier lives, and clinical
psychology involves the diagnosis and treatment of psychological disorders and other problematic behavioral
patterns. Sport and exercise psychologists study the interactions between thoughts, emotions, and physical
performance in sports, exercise, and other activities. Forensic psychologists carry out activities related to
psychology in association with the justice system.
1.4 Careers in Psychology
Generally, academic careers in psychology require doctoral degrees. However, there are a number of
nonacademic career options for people who have master’s degrees in psychology. While people with bachelor’s
degrees in psychology have more limited psychology-related career options, the skills acquired as a function of

Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these experiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain’s internal processes and people’s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of psychology has explored these questions. 1.1 What Is Psychology? LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Define psychology • Understand the merits of an education in psychology What is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology explores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists use the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question about how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the phenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over time. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes observations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then published or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results. Scientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because it is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We must ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However, we can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus, psychological science is empirical, based on measurable data. In general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot arrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the mind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific method is also limited in that it can only be applied to observable, measurable phenomena. It cannot be used to study unobservable, unmeasurable phenomena, such as the thoughts and feelings of individuals. Psychology is different from other sciences in several ways. First, psychology is an empirical science. Second, it is a social science, because it deals with human behavior and social interactions. Third, psychologists study individuals, not groups of people. Fourth, psychological research is often conducted in a laboratory setting, in which the researcher controls all variables except for the one that he or she is interested in studying. Fifth, the results of psychological studies are often published in scientific journals. Sixth, there are many different fields within psychology, each with its own subfields and subdisciplines. Each of these fields is further divided into sub-fields, sub-sub-fields and so on, until there is no limit to how many levels of sub-divisions there are within a single field. Finally, although psychology has been around for a long time, its methods and approaches have changed dramatically over the past few decades, as new research techniques and theories have been developed and applied. In this textbook, we will focus on psychology as it is practiced today, but we will also look at the history and development of other fields within the discipline. 2.2 Theories of Human Behavior Theories are generalizations about how the world works. They are hypotheses that have been repeatedly tested and found to be true. There are two main types of theories: descriptive and explanatory. Descriptive theories describe how things work. Explanatory theories attempt to predict what will happen in the future. Both types of theories are important in understanding how people think and behave. A descriptive theory describes the behavior of one or more people in terms of what they do and how they do it. Examples of descriptive theories include Freud’s theory of psychosexual development and Piaget’s theory of cognitive development. An explanatory theory attempts to make predictions about future behavior based on what we already know about past behavior. There are a number of different ways in which psychologists can test theories. One way is to observe people in the real world and measure their behavior in order to see if the theory makes sense. Another way of testing theories is through the use of experiments. These are experiments that involve manipulating variables in an attempt to determine whether or not they have an effect on a particular outcome. If a variable is manipulated, it","{""sections"": [""Introduction to Psychology/Contemporary Psychology"", ""Psychological Research/Approaches to Research""], ""pages"": [""22"", ""42"", ""44""]}"
14,"Use of Research Information
Trying to determine which theories are and are not accepted by the scientific community can be difficult,
especially in an area of research as broad as psychology. More than ever before, we have an incredible amount
of information at our fingertips, and a simple internet search on any given research topic might result in a
number of contradictory studies. In these cases, we are witnessing the scientific community going through the
process of reaching a consensus, and it could be quite some time before a consensus emerges. For example,
the explosion in our use of technology has led researchers to question whether this ultimately helps or hinders
us. The use and implementation of technology in educational settings has become widespread over the last few
decades. Researchers are coming to different conclusions regarding the use of technology. To illustrate this
point, a study investigating a smartphone app targeting surgery residents (graduate students in surgery
training) found that the use of this app can increase student engagement and raise test scores (Shaw & Tan,
2015). Conversely, another study found that the use of technology in undergraduate student populations had
negative impacts on sleep, communication, and time management skills (Massimini & Peterson, 2009). Until
sufficient amounts of research have been conducted, there will be no clear consensus on the effects that
technology has on a student's acquisition of knowledge, study skills, and mental health.
In the meantime, we should strive to think critically about the information we encounter by exercising a degree
of healthy skepticism. When someone makes a claim, we should examine the claim from a number of different
perspectives: what is the expertise of the person making the claim, what might they gain if the claim is valid,
does the claim seem justified given the evidence, and what do other researchers think of the claim? This is
especially important when we consider how much information in advertising campaigns and on the internet
claims to be based on “scientific evidence” when in actuality it is a belief or perspective of just a few
individuals trying to sell a product or draw attention to their perspectives.
We should be informed consumers of the information made available to us because decisions based on this
information have significant consequences. One such consequence can be seen in politics and public policy.
Imagine that you have been elected as the governor of your state. One of your responsibilities is to manage the
state budget and determine how to best spend your constituents’ tax dollars. As the new governor, you need to
decide whether to continue funding early intervention programs. These programs are designed to help
children who come from low-income backgrounds, have special needs, or face other disadvantages. These
programs may involve providing a wide variety of services to maximize the children's development and
position them for optimal levels of success in school and later in life (Blann, 2005). While such programs
sound appealing, you would want to be sure that they also proved effective before investing additional money
in these programs. Fortunately, psychologists and other scientists have conducted vast amounts of research on
such programs and, in general, the programs are found to be effective (Neil & Christensen, 2009; Peters-
Scheffer, Didden, Korzilius, & Sturmey, 2011). While not all programs are equally effective, and the short-term
effects of many such programs are more pronounced, there is reason to believe that many of these programs
produce long-term benefits for participants (Barnett, 2011). If you are committed to being a good steward of
taxpayer money, you would want to look at research. Which programs are most effective? What characteristics
of these programs make them effective? Which programs promote the best outcomes? After examining the
research, you would be best equipped to make decisions about which programs to fund.

Ultimately, it is not just politicians who can benefit from using research in guiding their decisions. We all might
look to research from time to time when making decisions in our lives. Imagine you just found out that your
sister Maria's child, Umberto, was recently diagnosed with autism. There are many treatments for autism that
help decrease the negative impact of autism on the individual. Some examples of treatments for autism are

applied behavior analysis (ABA), social communication groups, social skills groups, occupational therapy, and
even medication options. If Maria asked you for advice or guidance, what would you do? You would likely want
to review the research and learn about the efficacy of each treatment so you could best advise your sister.
In the end, research is what makes the difference between facts and opinions. Facts are observable realities,
and opinions are personal judgments, conclusions, or attitudes that may or may not be accurate. In the
scientific community, facts can be established only using evidence collected through empirical research.
NOTABLE RESEARCHERS
Psychological research has a long history involving important figures from diverse backgrounds. While the
introductory chapter discussed several researchers who made significant contributions to the discipline, there
are many more individuals who deserve attention in considering how psychology has advanced as a science
through their work (Figure 2.3). For instance, Margaret Floy Washburn (1871–1939) was the first woman to
earn a PhD in psychology. Her research focused on animal behavior and cognition (Margaret Floy Washburn,
PhD, n.d.). Mary Whiton Calkins (1863–1930) was a preeminent first-generation American psychologist who
opposed the behaviorist movement, conducted significant research into memory, and established one of the
earliest experimental psychology labs in the United States (Mary Whiton Calkins, n.d.).
Francis Sumner (1895–1954) was the first African American to receive a PhD in psychology in 1920. His
dissertation focused on issues related to psychoanalysis. Sumner also had research interests in racial bias and
educational justice. Sumner was one of the founders of Howard University’s department of psychology, and
because of his accomplishments, he is sometimes referred to as the “Father of Black Psychology.” Thirteen
years later, Inez Beverly Prosser (1895–1934) became the first African American woman to receive a PhD in
psychology. Prosser’s research highlighted issues related to education in segregated versus integrated schools,
and ultimately, her work was very influential in the hallmark Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court
ruling that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional (Ethnicity and Health in America Series:
Featured Psychologists, n.d.).
FIGURE 2.3 (a) Margaret Floy Washburn was the first woman to earn a doctorate degree in psychology. (b) The
outcome of Brown v. Board of Education was influenced by the research of psychologist Inez Beverly Prosser, who
was the first African American woman to earn a PhD in psychology.
Although the establishment of psychology’s scientific roots occurred first in Europe and the United States, it
did not take much time until researchers from around the world began to establish their own laboratories and
research programs. For example, some of the first experimental psychology laboratories in South America
were founded by Horatio Piñero (1869–1919) at two institutions in Buenos Aires, Argentina (Godoy & Brussino,
2010). In India, Gunamudian David Boaz (1908–1965) and Narendra Nath Sen Gupta (1889–1944) established
38 2 • Psychological Research

the first independent departments of psychology at the University of Madras and the University of Calcutta,
respectively. These developments provided an opportunity for Indian researchers to make important
contributions to the field (Gunamudian David Boaz, n.d.; Narendra Nath Sen Gupta, n.d.).
When the American Psychological Association (APA) was first founded in 1892, all of the members were White
males (Women and Minorities in Psychology, n.d.). However, by 1905, Mary Whiton Calkins was elected as the
first female president of the APA, and by 1946, nearly one-quarter of American psychologists were female.
Psychology became a popular degree option for students enrolled in the nation’s historically Black higher
education institutions, increasing the number of Black Americans who went on to become psychologists. Given
demographic shifts occurring in the United States and increased access to higher educational opportunities
among historically underrepresented populations, there is reason to hope that the diversity of the field will
increasingly match the larger population, and that the research contributions made by the psychologists of the
future will better serve people of all backgrounds (Women and Minorities in Psychology, n.d.).
The Process of Scientific Research
Scientific knowledge is advanced through a process known as the scientific method. Basically, ideas (in the
form of theories and hypotheses) are tested against the real world (in the form of empirical observations), and
those empirical observations lead to more ideas that are tested against the real world, and so on. In this sense,
the scientific process is circular. The types of reasoning within the circle are called deductive and inductive. In
deductive reasoning, ideas are tested in the real world; in inductive reasoning, real-world observations lead
to new ideas (Figure 2.4). These processes are inseparable, like inhaling and exhaling, but different research
approaches place different emphasis on the deductive and inductive aspects.
FIGURE 2.4 Psychological research relies on both inductive and deductive reasoning.
In the scientific context, deductive reasoning begins with a generalization—one hypothesis—that is then used
to reach logical conclusions about the real world. If the hypothesis is correct, then the logical conclusions
reached through deductive reasoning should also be correct. A deductive reasoning argument might go
something like this: All living things require energy to survive (this would be your hypothesis). Ducks are living
things. Therefore, ducks require energy to survive (logical conclusion). In this example, the hypothesis is
correct; therefore, the conclusion is correct as well. Sometimes, however, an incorrect hypothesis may lead to a
logical but incorrect conclusion. Consider this argument: all ducks are born with the ability to see. Quackers is
a duck. Therefore, Quackers was born with the ability to see. Scientists use deductive reasoning to empirically
test their hypotheses. Returning to the example of the ducks, researchers might design a study to test the
hypothesis that if all living things require energy to survive, then ducks will be found to require energy to
survive.
Deductive reasoning starts with a generalization that is tested against real-world observations; however,
inductive reasoning moves in the opposite direction. Inductive reasoning uses empirical observations to
2.1 • Why Is Research Important? 39
construct broad generalizations. Unlike deductive reasoning, conclusions drawn from inductive reasoning
may or may not be correct, regardless of the observations on which they are based. For instance, you may
notice that your favorite fruits—apples, bananas, and oranges—all grow on trees; therefore, you assume that all
fruit must grow on trees. This would be an example of inductive reasoning, and, clearly, the existence of
strawberries, blueberries, and kiwi demonstrate that this generalization is not correct despite it being based
on a number of direct observations. Scientists use inductive reasoning to formulate theories, which in turn
generate hypotheses that are tested with deductive reasoning. In the end, science involves both deductive and
inductive processes.
For example, case studies, which you will read about in the next section, are heavily weighted on the side of
empirical observations. Thus, case studies are closely associated with inductive processes as researchers
gather massive amounts of observations and seek interesting patterns (new ideas) in the data. Experimental
research, on the other hand, puts great emphasis on deductive reasoning.
We’ve stated that theories and hypotheses are ideas, but what sort of ideas are they, exactly? A theory is a well-
developed set of ideas that propose an explanation for observed phenomena. Theories are repeatedly checked
against the world, but they tend to be too complex to be tested all at once; instead, researchers create
hypotheses to test specific aspects of a theory.
A hypothesis is a testable prediction about how the world will behave if our idea is correct, and it is often
worded as an if-then statement (e.g., if I study all night, I will get a passing grade on the test). The hypothesis is
extremely important because it bridges the gap between the realm of ideas and the real world. As specific
hypotheses are tested, theories are modified and refined to reflect and incorporate the result of these tests
Figure 2.5.
FIGURE 2.5 The scientific method involves deriving hypotheses from theories and then testing those hypotheses. If
the results are consistent with the theory, then the theory is supported. If the results are not consistent, then the
theory should be modified and new hypotheses will be generated.
To see how this process works, let’s consider a specific theory and a hypothesis that might be generated from
that theory. As you’ll learn in a later chapter, the James-Lange theory of emotion asserts that emotional
experience relies on the physiological arousal associated with the emotional state. If you walked out of your
home and discovered a very aggressive snake waiting on your doorstep, your heart would begin to race and
your stomach churn. According to the James-Lange theory, these physiological changes would result in your
40 2 • Psychological Research

feeling of fear. A hypothesis that could be derived from this theory might be that a person who is unaware of
the physiological arousal that the sight of the snake elicits will not feel fear.
A scientific hypothesis is also falsifiable, or capable of being shown to be incorrect. Recall from the
introductory chapter that Sigmund Freud had lots of interesting ideas to explain various human behaviors
(Figure 2.6). However, a major criticism of Freud’s theories is that many of his ideas are not falsifiable; for
example, it is impossible to imagine empirical observations that would disprove the existence of the id, the
ego, and the superego—the three elements of personality described in Freud’s theories. Despite this, Freud’s
theories are widely taught in introductory psychology texts because of their historical significance for
personality psychology and psychotherapy, and these remain the root of all modern forms of therapy.
FIGURE 2.6 Many of the specifics of (a) Freud's theories, such as (b) his division of the mind into id, ego, and
superego, have fallen out of favor in recent decades because they are not falsifiable. In broader strokes, his views
set the stage for much of psychological thinking today, such as the unconscious nature of the majority of
psychological processes.
In contrast, the James-Lange theory does generate falsifiable hypotheses, such as the one described above.
Some individuals who suffer significant injuries to their spinal columns are unable to feel the bodily changes
that often accompany emotional experiences. Therefore, we could test the hypothesis by determining how
emotional experiences differ between individuals who have the ability to detect these changes in their
physiological arousal and those who do not. In fact, this research has been conducted and while the emotional
experiences of people deprived of an awareness of their physiological arousal may be less intense, they still
experience emotion (Chwalisz, Diener, & Gallagher, 1988).
Scientific research’s dependence on falsifiability allows for great confidence in the information that it
produces. Typically, by the time information is accepted by the scientific community, it has been tested
repeatedly.
2.2 Approaches to Research
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the different research methods used by psychologists
• Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of case studies, naturalistic observation, surveys, and archival research
• Compare longitudinal and cross-sectional approaches to research
• Compare and contrast correlation and causation
There are many research methods available to psychologists in their efforts to understand, describe, and
2.2 • Approaches to Research 41
explain behavior and the cognitive and biological processes that underlie it. Some methods rely on
observational techniques. Other approaches involve interactions between the researcher and the individuals
who are being studied—ranging from a series of simple questions to extensive, in-depth interviews—to well-
controlled experiments.
Each of these research methods has unique strengths and weaknesses, and each method may only be
appropriate for certain types of research questions. For example, studies that rely primarily on observation
produce incredible amounts of information, but the ability to apply this information to the larger population is
somewhat limited because of small sample sizes. Survey research, on the other hand, allows researchers to
easily collect data from relatively large samples. While this allows for results to be generalized to the larger
population more easily, the information that can be collected on any given survey is somewhat limited and
subject to problems associated with any type of self-reported data. Some researchers conduct archival
research by using existing records. While this can be a fairly inexpensive way to collect data that can provide
insight into a number of research questions, researchers using this approach have no control on how or what
kind of data was collected. All of the methods described thus far are correlational in nature. This means that
researchers can speak to important relationships that might exist between two or more variables of interest.
However, correlational data cannot be used to make claims about cause-and-effect relationships.
Correlational research can find a relationship between two variables, but the only way a researcher can claim
that the relationship between the variables is cause and effect is to perform an experiment. In experimental
research, which will be discussed later in this chapter, there is a tremendous amount of control over variables
of interest. While this is a powerful approach, experiments are often conducted in artificial settings. This calls
into question the validity of experimental findings with regard to how they would apply in real-world settings.
In addition, many of the questions that psychologists would like to answer cannot be pursued through
experimental research because of ethical concerns.
Clinical or Case Studies
In 2011, the New York Times published a feature story on Krista and Tatiana Hogan, Canadian twin girls.
These particular twins are unique because Krista and Tatiana are conjoined twins, connected at the head.
There is evidence that the two girls are connected in a part of the brain called the thalamus, which is a major
sensory relay center. Most incoming sensory information is sent through the thalamus before reaching higher
regions of the cerebral cortex for processing.
LINK T O LEARNING
Watch this CBC video about Krista's and Tatiana's lives (http://openstax.org/l/hogans) to learn more.
The implications of this potential connection mean that it might be possible for one twin to experience the
sensations of the other twin. For instance, if Krista is watching a particularly funny television program, Tatiana
might smile or laugh even if she is not watching the program. This particular possibility has piqued the
interest of many neuroscientists who seek to understand how the brain uses sensory information.
These twins represent an enormous resource in the study of the brain, and since their condition is very rare, it
is likely that as long as their family agrees, scientists will follow these girls very closely throughout their lives to
gain as much information as possible (Dominus, 2011).
Over time, it has become clear that while Krista and Tatiana share some sensory experiences and motor
control, they remain two distinct individuals, which provides invaluable insight for researchers interested in
the mind and the brain (Egnor, 2017).
In observational research, scientists are conducting a clinical or case study when they focus on one person or
just a few individuals. Indeed, some scientists spend their entire careers studying just 10–20 individuals. Why
would they do this? Obviously, when they focus their attention on a very small number of people, they can gain
42 2 • Psychological Research
Access for free at openstax.org
a precious amount of insight into those cases. The richness of information that is collected in clinical or case
studies is unmatched by any other single research method. This allows the researcher to have a very deep
understanding of the individuals and the particular phenomenon being studied.
If clinical or case studies provide so much information, why are they not more frequent among researchers?
As it turns out, the major benefit of this particular approach is also a weakness. As mentioned earlier, this
approach is often used when studying individuals who are interesting to researchers because they have a rare
characteristic. Therefore, the individuals who serve as the focus of case studies are not like most other people.
If scientists ultimately want to explain all behavior, focusing attention on such a special group of people can
make it difficult to generalize any observations to the larger population as a whole. Generalizing refers to the
ability to apply the findings of a particular research project to larger segments of society. Again, case studies
provide enormous amounts of information, but since the cases are so specific, the potential to apply what’s
learned to the average person may be very limited.
Naturalistic Observation
If you want to understand how behavior occurs, one of the best ways to gain information is to simply observe
the behavior in its natural context. However, people might change their behavior in unexpected ways if they
know they are being observed. How do researchers obtain accurate information when people tend to hide their
natural behavior? As an example, imagine that your professor asks everyone in your class to raise their hand if
they always wash their hands after using the restroom. Chances are that almost everyone in the classroom will
raise their hand, but do you think hand washing after every trip to the restroom is really that universal?
This is very similar to the phenomenon mentioned earlier in this chapter: many individuals do not feel
comfortable answering a question honestly. But if we are committed to finding out the facts about hand
washing, we have other options available to us.
Suppose we send a classmate into the restroom to actually watch whether everyone washes their hands after
using the restroom. Will our observer blend into the restroom environment by wearing a white lab coat, sitting
with a clipboard, and staring at the sinks? We want our researcher to be inconspicuous—perhaps standing at
one of the sinks pretending to put in contact lenses while secretly recording the relevant information. This
type of observational study is called naturalistic observation: observing behavior in its natural setting. To
better understand peer exclusion, Suzanne Fanger collaborated with colleagues at the University of Texas to
observe the behavior of preschool children on a playground. How did the observers remain inconspicuous
over the duration of the study? They equipped a few of the children with wireless microphones (which the
children quickly forgot about) and observed while taking notes from a distance. Also, the children in that
particular preschool (a “laboratory preschool”) were accustomed to having observers on the playground
(Fanger, Frankel, & Hazen, 2012).
It is critical that the observer be as unobtrusive and as inconspicuous as possible: when people know they are
being watched, they are less likely to behave naturally. If you have any doubt about this, ask yourself how your
driving behavior might differ in two situations: In the first situation, you are driving down a deserted highway
during the middle of the day; in the second situation, you are being followed by a police car down the same
deserted highway (Figure 2.7).
2.2 • Approaches to Research 43
will result in being ostracized) and his unconscious urges (attraction to males). The idea that he might be gay
causes Joe to have feelings of anxiety. How can he decrease his anxiety? Joe may find himself acting very
“macho,” making gay jokes, and picking on a school peer who is gay. This way, Joe’s unconscious impulses are
further submerged.
There are several different types of defense mechanisms. For instance, in repression, anxiety-causing
memories from consciousness are blocked. As an analogy, let’s say your car is making a strange noise, but
because you do not have the money to get it fixed, you just turn up the radio so that you no longer hear the
strange noise. Eventually you forget about it. Similarly, in the human psyche, if a memory is too overwhelming
to deal with, it might be repressed and thus removed from conscious awareness (Freud, 1920). This repressed
memory might cause symptoms in other areas.
Another defense mechanism is reaction formation, in which someone expresses feelings, thoughts, and
behaviors opposite to their inclinations. In the above example, Joe made fun of a gay peer while himself being
attracted to males. In regression, an individual acts much younger than their age. For example, a four-year-old
child who resents the arrival of a newborn sibling may act like a baby and revert to drinking out of a bottle. In
projection, a person refuses to acknowledge her own unconscious feelings and instead sees those feelings in
someone else. Other defense mechanisms include rationalization, displacement, and sublimation.

Stages of Psychosexual Development
Freud believed that personality develops during early childhood: Childhood experiences shape our
personalities as well as our behavior as adults. He asserted that we develop via a series of stages during
childhood. Each of us must pass through these childhood stages, and if we do not have the proper nurturing
and parenting during a stage, we will be stuck, or fixated, in that stage, even as adults.
In each psychosexual stage of development, the child’s pleasure-seeking urges, coming from the id, are
focused on a different area of the body, called an erogenous zone. The stages are oral, anal, phallic, latency, and
genital (Table 11.1).
Freud’s psychosexual development theory is quite controversial. To understand the origins of the theory, it is
helpful to be familiar with the political, social, and cultural influences of Freud’s day in Vienna at the turn of
the 20th century. During this era, a climate of sexual repression, combined with limited understanding and
education surrounding human sexuality, heavily influenced Freud’s perspective. Given that sex was a taboo
topic, Freud assumed that negative emotional states (neuroses) stemmed from suppression of unconscious
sexual and aggressive urges. For Freud, his own recollections and interpretations of patients’ experiences and
dreams were sufficient proof that psychosexual stages were universal events in early childhood.
Freud’s Stages of Psychosexual Development
Stage Age (years) Erogenous Zone Major Conflict Adult Fixation Example
Oral 0–1 Mouth Weaning off breast or bottle Smoking, overeating
Anal 1–3 Anus Toilet training Neatness, messiness
Phallic 3–6 Genitals Oedipus/Electra complex Vanity, overambition

TABLE 11.1
Oral Stage
In the oral stage (birth to 1 year), pleasure is focused on the mouth. Eating and the pleasure derived from
sucking (nipples, pacifiers, and thumbs) play a large part in a baby’s first year of life. At around 1 year of age,
babies are weaned from the bottle or breast, and this process can create conflict if not handled properly by
caregivers. According to Freud, an adult who smokes, drinks, overeats, or bites her nails is fixated in the oral
stage of her psychosexual development; she may have been weaned too early or too late, resulting in these
fixation tendencies, all of which seek to ease anxiety.
Anal Stage
After passing through the oral stage, children enter what Freud termed the anal stage (1–3 years). In this stage,
children experience pleasure in their bowel and bladder movements, so it makes sense that the conflict in this
stage is over toilet training. During this stage of development, children work to master control of themselves.
Freud suggested that success at the anal stage depended on how parents handled toilet training. Parents who
offer praise and rewards encourage positive results and can help children feel competent. Parents who are
harsh in toilet training can cause a child to become so fearful of soiling that they over-control and become
fixated at the anal stage, leading to the development of an anal-retentive personality. The anal-retentive
personality is stingy and stubborn, has a compulsive need for order and neatness, and might be considered a
perfectionist. If parents are too lenient in toilet training, the child may fail to develop sufficient self-control,
become fixated at this stage, and develop an anal-expulsive personality. The anal-expulsive personality is
messy, careless, disorganized, and prone to emotional outbursts.
Phallic Stage
Freud’s third stage of psychosexual development is the phallic stage (3–6 years), corresponding to the age
when children become aware of their bodies and recognize the differences between boys and girls. The
erogenous zone in this stage is the genitals. Conflict arises when the child feels a desire for the opposite-sex
parent, and jealousy and hatred toward the same-sex parent. For boys, this is called the Oedipus complex,
involving a boy's desire for his mother and his urge to replace his father who is seen as a rival for the mother’s
attention. At the same time, the boy is afraid his father will punish him for his feelings, so he experiences
castration anxiety. The Oedipus complex is successfully resolved when the boy begins to identify with his
father as an indirect way to have the mother. Failure to resolve the Oedipus complex may result in fixation and
development of a personality that might be described as vain and overly ambitious.
Girls experience a comparable conflict in the phallic stage—the Electra complex. The Electra complex, while
often attributed to Freud, was actually proposed by Freud’s protégé, Carl Jung (Jung & Kerenyi, 1963). A girl
desires the attention of her father and wishes to take her mother’s place. Jung also said that girls are angry
with the mother for not providing them with a penis—which he termed penis envy. While Freud initially
embraced the Electra complex as a parallel to the Oedipus complex, he later rejected it, yet it remains as a
cornerstone of Freudian theory, thanks in part to academics in the field (Freud, 1931/1968; Scott, 2005).
Latency Period
Following the phallic stage of psychosexual development is a period known as the latency period (6 years to
puberty). This period is not considered a stage, because sexual feelings are dormant as children focus on other
pursuits, such as school, friendships, hobbies, and sports. Children generally engage in activities with peers of
the same sex, which serves to consolidate a child’s gender-role identity.
11.2 • Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective 367
Genital Stage
The final stage is the genital stage (from puberty on). In this stage, there is a sexual reawakening as the
incestuous urges resurface. The young person redirects these urges to other, more socially acceptable partners
(who often resemble the other-sex parent). People in this stage have mature sexual interests, which for Freud
meant a strong desire for the opposite sex. Individuals who successfully completed the previous stages,
reaching the genital stage with no fixations, are said to be well-balanced, healthy adults.
While most of Freud’s ideas have not found support in modern research, and several contemporary
researchers rejected his premises, we cannot discount the contributions that Freud has made to the field of
psychology. It was Freud who pointed out that a large part of our mental life is influenced by the experiences of
early childhood and takes place outside of our conscious awareness; his theories paved the way for others.
While Freud's focus on biological drives led him to emphasize the impact of sociocultural factors on
personality development, his followers quickly realized that biology alone could not account for the diversity
they encountered as the practice of psychoanalysis spread during the time of the Nazi Holocaust. The
antisemitism which was prevalent during this period of time may have led mainstream psychoanalysts to
focus primarily on the universality of the psychological structures of the mind.
11.3 Neo-Freudians: Adler, Erikson, Jung, and Horney
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Discuss the concept of the inferiority complex
• Discuss the core differences between Erikson’s and Freud’s views on personality
• Discuss Jung’s ideas of the collective unconscious and archetypes
• Discuss the work of Karen Horney, including her revision of Freud’s “penis envy”
Freud attracted many followers who modified his ideas to create new theories about personality. These
theorists, referred to as neo-Freudians, generally agreed with Freud that childhood experiences matter, but
deemphasized sex, focusing more on the social environment and effects of culture on personality. Four notable
neo-Freudians include Alfred Adler, Erik Erikson, Carl Jung (pronounced “Yoong”), and Karen Horney
(pronounced “HORN-eye”).
Alfred Adler
Alfred Adler, a colleague of Freud’s and the first president of the Vienna Psychoanalytical Society (Freud’s
inner circle of colleagues), was the first major theorist to break away from Freud (Figure 11.8). He
subsequently founded a school of psychology called individual psychology, which focuses on our drive to
compensate for feelings of inferiority. Adler (1937, 1956) proposed the concept of the inferiority complex. An
inferiority complex refers to a person’s feelings that they lack worth and don’t measure up to the standards of
others or of society. Adler’s ideas about inferiority represent a major difference between his thinking and
Freud’s. Freud believed that we are motivated by sexual and aggressive urges, but Adler (1930, 1961) believed
that feelings of inferiority in childhood are what drive people to attempt to gain superiority and that this
striving is the force behind all of our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.

FIGURE 11.8 Alfred Adler proposed the concept of the inferiority complex.
Adler also believed in the importance of social connections, seeing childhood development emerging through
social development rather than the sexual stages Freud outlined. Adler noted the inter-relatedness of
humanity and the need to work together for the betterment of all. He said, “The happiness of mankind lies in
working together, in living as if each individual had set himself the task of contributing to the common welfare”
(Adler, 1964, p. 255) with the main goal of psychology being “to recognize the equal rights and equality of
others” (Adler, 1961, p. 691).
With these ideas, Adler identified three fundamental social tasks that all of us must experience: occupational
tasks (careers), societal tasks (friendship), and love tasks (finding an intimate partner for a long-term
relationship). Rather than focus on sexual or aggressive motives for behavior as Freud did, Adler focused on
social motives. He also emphasized conscious rather than unconscious motivation, since he believed that the
three fundamental social tasks are explicitly known and pursued. That is not to say that Adler did not also
believe in unconscious processes—he did—but he felt that conscious processes were more important.
One of Adler’s major contributions to personality psychology was the idea that our birth order shapes our
personality. He proposed that older siblings, who start out as the focus of their parents’ attention but must
share that attention once a new child joins the family, compensate by becoming overachievers. The youngest
children, according to Adler, may be spoiled, leaving the middle child with the opportunity to minimize the
negative dynamics of the youngest and oldest children. Despite popular attention, research has not
conclusively confirmed Adler’s hypotheses about birth order.

Erik Erikson
As an art school dropout with an uncertain future, young Erik Erikson met Freud’s daughter, Anna Freud, while
he was tutoring the children of an American couple undergoing psychoanalysis in Vienna. It was Anna Freud
who encouraged Erikson to study psychoanalysis. Erikson received his diploma from the Vienna
Psychoanalytic Institute in 1933, and as Nazism spread across Europe, he fled the country and immigrated to
the United States that same year. As you learned when you studied lifespan development, Erikson later
proposed a psychosocial theory of development, suggesting that an individual’s personality develops
throughout the lifespan—a departure from Freud’s view that personality is fixed in early life. In his theory,
Erikson emphasized the social relationships that are important at each stage of personality development, in
contrast to Freud’s emphasis on sex. Erikson identified eight stages, each of which represents a conflict or
developmental task (Table 11.2). The development of a healthy personality and a sense of competence depend
on the successful completion of each task.

Carl Jung
Carl Jung (Figure 11.9) was a Swiss psychiatrist and protégé of Freud, who later split off from Freud and
developed his own theory, which he called analytical psychology. The focus of analytical psychology is on
working to balance opposing forces of conscious and unconscious thought, and experience within one’s
personality. According to Jung, this work is a continuous learning process—mainly occurring in the second half
of life—of becoming aware of unconscious elements and integrating them into consciousness.

","Answer VERY concisely from the provided context only. Your answer length: less or equal 150 tokens. Plain text, no Markdown. Answer only, no other questions. Context: Use of Research Information Trying to determine which theories are and are not accepted by the scientific community can be difficult, especially in an area of research as broad as psychology. More than ever before, we have an incredible amount of information at our fingertips, and a simple internet search on any given research topic might result in a number of contradictory studies. In these cases, we are witnessing the scientific community going through the process of reaching a consensus, and it could be quite some time before a consensus emerges. For example, the explosion in our use of technology has led researchers to question whether this ultimately helps or hinders us. The use and implementation of technology in educational settings has become widespread over the last few decades. Researchers are coming to different conclusions regarding the use of technology. To illustrate this point, a study investigating a smartphone app targeting surgery residents (graduate students in surgery training) found that the use of this app can increase student engagement and raise test scores (Shaw & Tan, 2015). Conversely, another study found that the use of technology in undergraduate student populations had negative impacts on sleep, communication, and time management skills (Massimini & Peterson, 2009). Until sufficient amounts of research have been conducted, there will be no clear consensus on the effects that technology has on a student's acquisition of knowledge, study skills, and mental health. In the meantime, we should strive to think critically about the information we encounter by exercising a degree of healthy skepticism. When someone makes a claim, we should examine the claim from a number of different perspectives: what is the expertise of the person making the claim, what might they gain if the claim is valid, does the claim seem justified given the evidence, and what do other researchers think of the claim? This is especially important when we consider how much information in advertising campaigns and on the internet claims to be based on “scientific evidence” when in actuality it is a belief or perspective of just a few individuals trying to sell a product or draw attention to their perspectives. We should be informed consumers of the information made available to us because decisions based on this information have significant consequences. One such consequence can be seen in politics and public policy. Imagine that you have been elected to a position of leadership in your community. You are given a task to improve the quality of life for the residents of your town. As you begin to implement your plan, you are encouraged to consult with a variety of experts in the field of public health to help you make the best possible decisions. However, when you ask for their advice, the experts are often reluctant to share their opinions with you because they are afraid of losing their jobs or reputations if they do not agree with your plan. They may also be hesitant to provide you with information that could damage their reputation if they are found to have made a mistake in their opinion. This can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications between you and your experts, as well as a lack of trust and cooperation between them and you. It is important to be aware of these potential issues and to take steps to address them in order to ensure that your decision-making process is as transparent and fair as possible. Another example of a situation where skepticism and critical thinking are important is in scientific research and the development of new technologies. If a new technology is developed that has the potential to revolutionize the way we live and work, researchers and developers must be transparent about its potential risks and benefits so that people can make informed decisions about whether or not to adopt it. Similarly, if a company develops a new product that is marketed as “green” or “eco-friendly,” it must provide consumers with clear information about its environmental impact and how it compares to other products in its category. Without this transparency, consumers may not be able to make an informed decision about which products to purchase or use, which could lead to negative consequences for both the company and the environment. Finally, it's important to remember that skepticism is not a zero-sum game. While skepticism can help us be more critical of what we read or hear and more open-minded when considering new ideas and perspectives, it is also possible that we may be biased or influenced by our own preconceptions and assumptions. Therefore, we should approach new information with an open mind and be willing to engage in ongoing dialogue with others who may have different perspectives or experiences. By doing so,we can build a more inclusive and diverse community of thinkers and practitioners who can work together to create a better future for ourselves and for our planet.

15,"FIGURE 5.23 There are many types of sensory receptors located in the skin, each attuned to specific touch-related
stimuli.
In addition to the receptors located in the skin, there are also a number of free nerve endings that serve
sensory functions. These nerve endings respond to a variety of different types of touch-related stimuli and
serve as sensory receptors for both thermoception (temperature perception) and nociception (a signal
indicating potential harm and maybe pain) (Garland, 2012; Petho & Reeh, 2012; Spray, 1986). Sensory
information collected from the receptors and free nerve endings travels up the spinal cord and is transmitted
to regions of the medulla, thalamus, and ultimately to somatosensory cortex, which is located in the
postcentral gyrus of the parietal lobe.
Pain Perception
Pain is an unpleasant experience that involves both physical and psychological components. Feeling pain is
quite adaptive because it makes us aware of an injury, and it motivates us to remove ourselves from the cause
of that injury. In addition, pain also makes us less likely to suffer additional injury because we will be gentler
with our injured body parts.
Generally speaking, pain can be considered to be neuropathic or inflammatory in nature. Pain that signals
some type of tissue damage is known as inflammatory pain. In some situations, pain results from damage to
neurons of either the peripheral or central nervous system. As a result, pain signals that are sent to the brain
get exaggerated. This type of pain is known as neuropathic pain. Multiple treatment options for pain relief
range from relaxation therapy to the use of analgesic medications to deep brain stimulation. The most effective
treatment option for a given individual will depend on a number of considerations, including the severity and
persistence of the pain and any medical/psychological conditions.
Some individuals are born without the ability to feel pain. This very rare genetic disorder is known as
congenital insensitivity to pain (or congenital analgesia). While those with congenital analgesia can detect
differences in temperature and pressure, they cannot experience pain. As a result, they often suffer significant
injuries. Young children have serious mouth and tongue injuries because they have bitten themselves
repeatedly. Not surprisingly, individuals suffering from this disorder have much shorter life expectancies due
to their injuries and secondary infections of injured sites (U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2013).

The Vestibular Sense, Proprioception, and Kinesthesia
The vestibular sense contributes to our ability to maintain balance and body posture. As Figure 5.24 shows,
the major sensory organs (utricle, saccule, and the three semicircular canals) of this system are located next to
the cochlea in the inner ear. The vestibular organs are fluid-filled and have hair cells, similar to the ones found
5.5 • The Other Senses 167
in the auditory system, which respond to movement of the head and gravitational forces. When these hair cells
are stimulated, they send signals to the brain via the vestibular nerve. Although we may not be consciously
aware of our vestibular system’s sensory information under normal circumstances, its importance is apparent
when we experience motion sickness and/or dizziness related to infections of the inner ear (Khan & Chang,
2013).
FIGURE 5.24 The major sensory organs of the vestibular system are located next to the cochlea in the inner ear.
These include the utricle, saccule, and the three semicircular canals (posterior, superior, and horizontal).
In addition to maintaining balance, the vestibular system collects information critical for controlling
movement and the reflexes that move various parts of our bodies to compensate for changes in body position.
Therefore, both proprioception (perception of body position) and kinesthesia (perception of the body’s
movement through space) interact with information provided by the vestibular system.
These sensory systems also gather information from receptors that respond to stretch and tension in muscles,
joints, skin, and tendons (Lackner & DiZio, 2005; Proske, 2006; Proske & Gandevia, 2012). Proprioceptive and
kinesthetic information travels to the brain via the spinal column. Several cortical regions in addition to the
cerebellum receive information from and send information to the sensory organs of the proprioceptive and
kinesthetic systems.
5.6 Gestalt Principles of Perception
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Explain the figure-ground relationship
• Define Gestalt principles of grouping
• Describe how perceptual set is influenced by an individual’s characteristics and mental state
In the early part of the 20th century, Max Wertheimer published a paper demonstrating that individuals
perceived motion in rapidly flickering static images—an insight that came to him as he used a child’s toy
tachistoscope. Wertheimer, and his assistants Wolfgang Köhler and Kurt Koffka, who later became his
partners, believed that perception involved more than simply combining sensory stimuli. This belief led to a
new movement within the field of psychology known as Gestalt psychology. The word gestalt literally means
form or pattern, but its use reflects the idea that the whole is different from the sum of its parts. In other words,
the brain creates a perception that is more than simply the sum of available sensory inputs, and it does so in
predictable ways. Gestalt psychologists translated these predictable ways into principles by which we organize
sensory information. As a result, Gestalt psychology has been extremely influential in the area of sensation
168 5 • Sensation and Perception

and perception (Rock & Palmer, 1990).
One Gestalt principle is the figure-ground relationship. According to this principle, we tend to segment our
visual world into figure and ground. Figure is the object or person that is the focus of the visual field, while the
ground is the background. As Figure 5.25 shows, our perception can vary tremendously, depending on what is
perceived as figure and what is perceived as ground. Presumably, our ability to interpret sensory information
depends on what we label as figure and what we label as ground in any particular case, although this
assumption has been called into question (Peterson & Gibson, 1994; Vecera & O’Reilly, 1998).
FIGURE 5.25 The concept of figure-ground relationship explains why this image can be perceived either as a vase
or as a pair of faces.
Another Gestalt principle for organizing sensory stimuli into meaningful perception is proximity. This
principle asserts that things that are close to one another tend to be grouped together, as Figure 5.26
illustrates.
FIGURE 5.26 The Gestalt principle of proximity suggests that you see (a) one block of dots on the left side and (b)
three columns on the right side.
How we read something provides another illustration of the proximity concept. For example, we read this
sentence like this, notl iket hiso rt hat. We group the letters of a given word together because there are no
spaces between the letters, and we perceive words because there are spaces between each word. Here are
some more examples: Cany oum akes enseo ft hiss entence? What doth es e wor dsmea n?
We might also use the principle of similarity to group things in our visual fields. According to this principle,
things that are alike tend to be grouped together (Figure 5.27). For example, when watching a football game, we
tend to group individuals based on the colors of their uniforms. When watching an offensive drive, we can get a
5.6 • Gestalt Principles of Perception 169
sense of the two teams simply by grouping along this dimension.
FIGURE 5.27 When looking at this array of dots, we likely perceive alternating rows of colors. We are grouping these
dots according to the principle of similarity.
Two additional Gestalt principles are the law of continuity (or good continuation) and closure. The law of
continuity suggests that we are more likely to perceive continuous, smooth flowing lines rather than jagged,
broken lines (Figure 5.28). The principle of closure states that we organize our perceptions into complete
objects rather than as a series of parts (Figure 5.29).
FIGURE 5.28 Good continuation would suggest that we are more likely to perceive this as two overlapping lines,
rather than four lines meeting in the center.
FIGURE 5.29 Closure suggests that we will perceive a complete circle and rectangle rather than a series of
segments.

According to Gestalt theorists, pattern perception, or our ability to discriminate among different figures and
shapes, occurs by following the principles described above. You probably feel fairly certain that your
perception accurately matches the real world, but this is not always the case. Our perceptions are based on
perceptual hypotheses: educated guesses that we make while interpreting sensory information. These
hypotheses are informed by a number of factors, including our personalities, experiences, and expectations.
We use these hypotheses to generate our perceptual set. For instance, research has demonstrated that those
who are given verbal priming produce a biased interpretation of complex ambiguous figures (Goolkasian &
Woodbury, 2010).
The Depths of Perception: Bias, Prejudice, and Cultural Factors
In this chapter, you have learned that perception is a complex process. Built from sensations, but influenced by
our own experiences, biases, prejudices, and cultures, perceptions can be very different from person to person.
Research suggests that implicit racial prejudice and stereotypes affect perception. For instance, several studies
have demonstrated that non-Black participants identify weapons faster and are more likely to identify non-
weapons as weapons when the image of the weapon is paired with the image of a Black person (Payne, 2001;
Payne, Shimizu, & Jacoby, 2005). Furthermore, White individuals’ decisions to shoot an armed target in a video
game is made more quickly when the target is Black (Correll, Park, Judd, & Wittenbrink, 2002; Correll, Urland, &
Ito, 2006). This research is important, considering the number of very high-profile cases in the last few decades
in which Black people were killed by people who claimed to believe that the unarmed individuals were armed
and/or represented some threat to their personal safety.

Some individuals are born without the ability to feel pain. This very rare genetic disorder is known as congenital insensitivity to pain (or congenital analgesia). While those with congenital analgesia can detect differences in temperature and pressure, they cannot experience pain. As a result, these individuals will not be able to tell the difference between a hot or cold object and a sharp or sharp object. They will also not be able to differentiate between hot and cold temperatures, as well as between pressure and force. Because of their inability to detect pain, individuals with this condition will have a very low pain threshold, meaning that they will experience much more pain than they would if they were not born with the condition. Individuals with this condition are often referred to as “painless” because they do not experience any pain at all. However, painful sensations can still be experienced, but they are not as intense as those experienced by individuals without this genetic condition. There are two main ways in which pain perception is affected by genetic factors. One way is through mutations in genes that encode proteins involved in pain signaling. For example, a mutation in a gene that encodes a pain receptor protein could result in an individual being unable to sense pain. The other way that genetic mutations can affect pain sensitivity is by altering the structure of proteins involved with pain transmission. A mutation that changes the amino acid sequence of a protein can result in a change in how the protein interacts with other proteins and how it is transported across the cell membrane. These changes in protein structure can alter the way pain messages are transmitted, resulting in altered pain perception. Genetic factors can also play a role in determining whether or not a person will develop chronic pain symptoms. Chronic pain symptoms are defined as pain that persists for at least 3 months, or 6 months in cases where there is no apparent cause for the symptoms. There is some evidence to suggest that certain genetic variations may increase the risk of developing chronic low back pain or osteoarthritis. It is also known that people with a genetic predisposition to chronic conditions may be at a higher risk for developing chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, stroke, cancer, osteoporosis, depression, and anxiety. People who are predisposed to these conditions are more likely than others to develop these conditions and to experience more severe symptoms when they develop them. Therefore, if someone has a family history of chronic health conditions, it would be wise for them to take steps to reduce their risk for developing such conditions. Some of these steps include eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, getting regular checkups, avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, managing stress levels, taking medications as prescribed by their","{""sections"": [""Learning"", ""Learning/Classical Conditioning"", ""Learning/What Is Learning?""], ""pages"": [""181"", ""183"", ""182""]}"

act of sitting with receiving a treat. He learns that the consequence of sitting is that he gets a doggie biscuit
(Figure 6.2). Conversely, if the dog is punished when exhibiting a behavior, it becomes conditioned to avoid
that behavior (e.g., receiving a small shock when crossing the boundary of an invisible electric fence).
FIGURE 6.2 In operant conditioning, a response is associated with a consequence. This dog has learned that
certain behaviors result in receiving a treat. (credit: Crystal Rolfe)
Observational learning extends the effective range of both classical and operant conditioning. In contrast to
classical and operant conditioning, in which learning occurs only through direct experience, observational
learning is the process of watching others and then imitating what they do. A lot of learning among humans
and other animals comes from observational learning. To get an idea of the extra effective range that
observational learning brings, consider Ben and his son Julian from the introduction. How might observation
help Julian learn to surf, as opposed to learning by trial and error alone? By watching his father, he can imitate
the moves that bring success and avoid the moves that lead to failure. Can you think of something you have
learned how to do after watching someone else?
All of the approaches covered in this chapter are part of a particular tradition in psychology, called
behaviorism, which we discuss in the next section. However, these approaches do not represent the entire
study of learning. Separate traditions of learning have taken shape within different fields of psychology, such
as memory and cognition, so you will find that other chapters will round out your understanding of the topic.
Over time these traditions tend to converge. For example, in this chapter you will see how cognition has come
to play a larger role in behaviorism, whose more extreme adherents once insisted that behaviors are triggered
by the environment with no intervening thought.
6.2 Classical Conditioning
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Explain how classical conditioning occurs
• Summarize the processes of acquisition, extinction, spontaneous recovery, generalization, and discrimination
Does the name Ivan Pavlov ring a bell? Even if you are new to the study of psychology, chances are that you
have heard of Pavlov and his famous dogs.
Pavlov (1849–1936), a Russian scientist, performed extensive research on dogs and is best known for his
experiments in classical conditioning (Figure 6.3). As we discussed briefly in the previous section, classical
conditioning is a process by which we learn to associate stimuli and, consequently, to anticipate events.
6.2 • Classical Conditioning 183
FIGURE 6.3 Ivan Pavlov’s research on the digestive system of dogs unexpectedly led to his discovery of the learning
process now known as classical conditioning.
Pavlov came to his conclusions about how learning occurs completely by accident. Pavlov was a physiologist,
not a psychologist. Physiologists study the life processes of organisms, from the molecular level to the level of
cells, organ systems, and entire organisms. Pavlov’s area of interest was the digestive system (Hunt, 2007). In
his studies with dogs, Pavlov measured the amount of saliva produced in response to various foods. Over time,
Pavlov (1927) observed that the dogs began to salivate not only at the taste of food, but also at the sight of food,
at the sight of an empty food bowl, and even at the sound of the laboratory assistants' footsteps. Salivating to
food in the mouth is reflexive, so no learning is involved. However, dogs don’t naturally salivate at the sight of
an empty bowl or the sound of footsteps.
These unusual responses intrigued Pavlov, and he wondered what accounted for what he called the dogs'
“psychic secretions” (Pavlov, 1927). To explore this phenomenon in an objective manner, Pavlov designed a
series of carefully controlled experiments to see which stimuli would cause the dogs to salivate. He was able to
train the dogs to salivate in response to stimuli that clearly had nothing to do with food, such as the sound of a
bell, a light, and a touch on the leg. Through his experiments, Pavlov realized that an organism has two types of
responses to its environment: (1) unconditioned (unlearned) responses, or reflexes, and (2) conditioned
(learned) responses.
In Pavlov’s experiments, the dogs salivated each time meat powder was presented to them. The meat powder
in this situation was an unconditioned stimulus (UCS): a stimulus that elicits a reflexive response in an
organism. The dogs’ salivation was an unconditioned response (UCR): a natural (unlearned) reaction to a
given stimulus. Before conditioning, think of the dogs’ stimulus and response like this:
In classical conditioning, a neutral stimulus is presented immediately before an unconditioned stimulus.
Pavlov would sound a tone (like ringing a bell) and then give the dogs the meat powder (Figure 6.4). The tone
was the neutral stimulus (NS), which is a stimulus that does not naturally elicit a response. Prior to
conditioning, the dogs did not salivate when they just heard the tone because the tone had no association for
the dogs.
When Pavlov paired the tone with the meat powder over and over again, the previously neutral stimulus (the
tone) also began to elicit salivation from the dogs. Thus, the neutral stimulus became the conditioned
stimulus (CS), which is a stimulus that elicits a response after repeatedly being paired with an unconditioned
stimulus. Eventually, the dogs began to salivate to the tone alone, just as they previously had salivated at the
sound of the assistants’ footsteps. The behavior caused by the conditioned stimulus is called the conditioned
response (CR). In the case of Pavlov’s dogs, they had learned to associate the tone (CS) with being fed, and they
began to salivate (CR) in anticipation of food.

FIGURE 6.4 Before conditioning, an unconditioned stimulus (food) produces an unconditioned response
(salivation), and a neutral stimulus (bell) does not produce a response. During conditioning, the unconditioned
stimulus (food) is presented repeatedly just after the presentation of the neutral stimulus (bell). After conditioning,
the neutral stimulus alone produces a conditioned response (salivation), thus becoming a conditioned stimulus.

Real World Application of Classical Conditioning
How does classical conditioning work in the real world? Consider the case of Moisha, who was diagnosed with
cancer. When she received her first chemotherapy treatment, she vomited shortly after the chemicals were
injected. In fact, every trip to the doctor for chemotherapy treatment shortly after the drugs were injected, she
vomited. Moisha’s treatment was a success and her cancer went into remission. Now, when she visits her
oncologist's office every 6 months for a check-up, she becomes nauseous. In this case, the chemotherapy drugs
are the unconditioned stimulus (UCS), vomiting is the unconditioned response (UCR), the doctor’s office is the
conditioned stimulus (CS) after being paired with the UCS, and nausea is the conditioned response (CR). Let's
assume that the chemotherapy drugs that Moisha takes are given through a syringe injection. After entering
the doctor's office, Moisha sees a syringe, and then gets her medication. In addition to the doctor's office,
Moisha will learn to associate the syringe with the medication and will respond to syringes with nausea. This is
an example of higher-order (or second-order) conditioning, when the conditioned stimulus (the doctor's office)
serves to condition another stimulus (the syringe). It is hard to achieve anything above second-order
conditioning. For example, if someone rang a bell every time Moisha received a syringe injection of
chemotherapy drugs in the doctor's office, Moisha likely will never get sick in response to the bell.
Consider another example of classical conditioning. Let’s say you have a cat named Tiger, who is quite spoiled.
You keep her food in a separate cabinet, and you also have a special electric can opener that you use only to
open cans of cat food. For every meal, Tiger hears the distinctive sound of the electric can opener (“zzhzhz”)
and then gets her food. Tiger quickly learns that when she hears “zzhzhz” she is about to get fed. What do you
think Tiger does when she hears the electric can opener? She will likely get excited and run to where you are
6.2 • Classical Conditioning 185
preparing her food. This is an example of classical conditioning. In this case, what are the UCS, CS, UCR, and
CR?
What if the cabinet holding Tiger’s food becomes squeaky? In that case, Tiger hears “squeak” (the cabinet),
“zzhzhz” (the electric can opener), and then she gets her food. Tiger will learn to get excited when she hears
the “squeak” of the cabinet. Pairing a new neutral stimulus (“squeak”) with the conditioned stimulus
(“zzhzhz”) is called higher-order conditioning, or second-order conditioning. This means you are using the
conditioned stimulus of the can opener to condition another stimulus: the squeaky cabinet (Figure 6.5). It is
hard to achieve anything above second-order conditioning. For example, if you ring a bell, open the cabinet
(“squeak”), use the can opener (“zzhzhz”), and then feed Tiger, Tiger will likely never get excited when hearing
the bell alone.
FIGURE 6.5 In higher-order conditioning, an established conditioned stimulus is paired with a new neutral stimulus
(the second-order stimulus), so that eventually the new stimulus also elicits the conditioned response, without the
initial conditioned stimulus being presented.

and conch (unconditioned stimulus) at a particular sandbar near a barrier reef, and large numbers of stingrays
would swim in to eat (unconditioned response) what the people threw into the water; this continued for years. By
the late 1980s, word of the large group of stingrays spread among scuba divers, who then started feeding them
by hand. Over time, the southern stingrays in the area were classically conditioned much like Pavlov’s dogs.
When they hear the sound of a boat engine (neutral stimulus that becomes a conditioned stimulus), they know
that they will get to eat (conditioned response).
As soon as they reached Stingray City, over two dozen stingrays surrounded their tour boat. The couple slipped
into the water with bags of squid, the stingrays’ favorite treat. The swarm of stingrays bumped and rubbed up
against their legs like hungry cats (Figure 6.6). Kate was able to feed, pet, and even kiss (for luck) these amazing
creatures. Then all the squid was gone, and so were the stingrays.

classically conditioned to associate the sound of a boat motor with food provided by tourists. (credit: Kathryn
Dumper)
Classical conditioning also applies to humans, even babies. For example, Elan buys formula in blue canisters
for their six-month-old daughter, Angelina. Whenever Elan takes out a formula container, Angelina gets
excited, tries to reach toward the food, and most likely salivates. Why does Angelina get excited when she sees
the formula canister? What are the UCS, CS, UCR, and CR here?
So far, all of the examples have involved food, but classical conditioning extends beyond the basic need to be
fed. Consider our earlier example of a dog whose owners install an invisible electric dog fence. A small
electrical shock (unconditioned stimulus) elicits discomfort (unconditioned response). When the
unconditioned stimulus (shock) is paired with a neutral stimulus (the edge of a yard), the dog associates the
discomfort (unconditioned response) with the edge of the yard (conditioned stimulus) and stays within the set
boundaries. In this example, the edge of the yard elicits fear and anxiety in the dog. Fear and anxiety are the
conditioned response.

been a prosocial model in your life?
The antisocial effects of observational learning are also worth mentioning. As you saw from the example of
Claire at the beginning of this section, her daughter viewed Claire’s aggressive behavior and copied it.
Research suggests that this may help to explain why victims of abuse often grow up to be abusers themselves
(Murrell, Christoff, & Henning, 2007). In fact, about 30% of child abuse victims become abusive parents (U.S.
Department of Health & Human Services, 2013). We tend to do what we know. Children who grow up
witnessing their parents deal with anger and frustration through violent and aggressive acts often learn to
behave in that manner themselves.
Some studies suggest that violent television shows, movies, and video games may also have antisocial effects
(Figure 6.18) although further research needs to be done to understand the correlational and causational
aspects of media violence and behavior. Some studies have found a link between viewing violence and
aggression seen in children (Anderson & Gentile, 2008; Kirsch, 2010; Miller, Grabell, Thomas, Bermann, &
Graham-Bermann, 2012). These findings may not be surprising, given that a child graduating from high school
has been exposed to around 200,000 violent acts including murder, robbery, torture, bombings, beatings, and
rape through various forms of media (Huston et al., 1992). Not only might viewing media violence affect
aggressive behavior by teaching people to act that way in real life situations, but it has also been suggested that
repeated exposure to violent acts also desensitizes people to it. Psychologists are working to understand this
dynamic.

Violent Media and Aggression
Does watching violent media or playing violent video games cause aggression? Albert Bandura's early studies
suggested television violence increased aggression in children, and more recent studies support these findings.
For example, research by Craig Anderson and colleagues (Anderson, Bushman, Donnerstein, Hummer, &
Warburton, 2015; Anderson et al., 2010; Bushman et al., 2016) found extensive evidence to suggest a causal
link between hours of exposure to violent media and aggressive thoughts and behaviors. However, studies by
Christopher Ferguson and others suggests that while there may be a link between violent media exposure and
aggression, research to date has not accounted for other risk factors for aggression including mental health and
family life (Ferguson, 2011; Gentile, 2016). What do think?

Summary
6.1 What Is Learning?
Instincts and reflexes are innate behaviors—they occur naturally and do not involve learning. In contrast,
learning is a change in behavior or knowledge that results from experience. There are three main types of
learning: classical conditioning, operant conditioning, and observational learning. Both classical and operant
conditioning are forms of associative learning where associations are made between events that occur
together. Observational learning is just as it sounds: learning by observing others.
6.2 Classical Conditioning
Pavlov’s pioneering work with dogs contributed greatly to what we know about learning. His experiments
explored the type of associative learning we now call classical conditioning. In classical conditioning,
organisms learn to associate events that repeatedly happen together, and researchers study how a reflexive
response to a stimulus can be mapped to a different stimulus—by training an association between the two
stimuli. Pavlov’s experiments show how stimulus-response bonds are formed. Watson, the founder of
behaviorism, was greatly influenced by Pavlov’s work. He tested humans by conditioning fear in an infant
known as Little Albert. His findings suggest that classical conditioning can explain how some fears develop.
6.3 Operant Conditioning
Operant conditioning is based on the work of B. F. Skinner. Operant conditioning is a form of learning in which
the motivation for a behavior happens after the behavior is demonstrated. An animal or a human receives a
consequence after performing a specific behavior. The consequence is either a reinforcer or a punisher. All
reinforcement (positive or negative) increases the likelihood of a behavioral response. All punishment
(positive or negative) decreases the likelihood of a behavioral response. Several types of reinforcement
schedules are used to reward behavior depending on either a set or variable period of time.
6.4 Observational Learning (Modeling)
According to Bandura, learning can occur by watching others and then modeling what they do or say. This is
known as observational learning. There are specific steps in the process of modeling that must be followed if
learning is to be successful. These steps include attention, retention, reproduction, and motivation. Through
modeling, Bandura has shown that children learn many things both good and bad simply by watching their
parents, siblings, and others.

7.6 The Source of Intelligence
What is the best way to solve a problem? How does a person who has never seen or touched
snow in real life develop an understanding of the concept of snow? How do young children acquire the ability
to learn language with no formal instruction? Psychologists who study thinking explore questions like these
and are called cognitive psychologists.
Cognitive psychologists also study intelligence. What is intelligence, and how does it vary from person to
person? Are “street smarts” a kind of intelligence, and if so, how do they relate to other types of intelligence?
What does an IQ test really measure? These questions and more will be explored in this chapter as you study
thinking and intelligence.
In other chapters, we discussed the cognitive processes of perception, learning, and memory. In this chapter,
we will focus on high-level cognitive processes. As a part of this discussion, we will consider thinking and
briefly explore the development and use of language. We will also discuss problem solving and creativity
before ending with a discussion of how intelligence is measured and how our biology and environments
interact to affect intelligence. After finishing this chapter, you will have a greater appreciation of the higher-
level cognitive processes that contribute to our distinctiveness as a species.
7Thinking and Intelligence
","Answer VERY concisely from the provided context only. Your answer length: less or equal 150 tokens. Plain text, no Markdown. Answer only, no other questions. Context: tell Hodor to sit, and give him a treat when he does. After repeated experiences, Hodor begins to associate the act of sitting with receiving a treat. He learns that the consequence of sitting is that he gets a doggie biscuit (Figure 6.2). Conversely, if the dog is punished when exhibiting a behavior, it becomes conditioned to avoid that behavior (e.g., receiving a small shock when crossing the boundary of an invisible electric fence). FIGURE 6.2 In operant conditioning, a response is associated with a consequence. This dog has learned that certain behaviors result in receiving a treat. (credit: Crystal Rolfe) Observational learning extends the effective range of both classical and operant conditioning. In contrast to classical and operant conditioning, in which learning occurs only through direct experience, observational learning is the process of watching others and then imitating what they do. A lot of learning among humans and other animals comes from observational learning. To get an idea of the extra effective range that observational learning brings, consider Ben and his son Julian from the introduction. How might observation help Julian learn to surf, as opposed to learning by trial and error alone? By watching his father, he can imitate the moves that bring success and avoid the moves that lead to failure. Can you think of something you have learned how to do after watching someone else? All of the approaches covered in this chapter are part of a particular tradition in psychology, called behaviorism, which we discuss in the next section. However, these approaches do not represent the entire study of learning. Separate traditions of learning have taken shape within different fields of psychology, such as memory and cognition, so you will find that other chapters will round out your understanding of the topic. Over time these traditions tend to converge. For example, in this chapter you will see how cognition has come to play a larger role in behaviorism, whose more extreme adherents once insisted that behaviors are triggered by the environment with no intervening thought. 6.2 Classical Conditioning LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Explain how classical conditioning occurs • Summarize the processes of acquisition, extinction, spontaneous recovery, generalization and generalization Classical conditioning is a process by which a conditioned stimulus (CS) is paired with an unconditioned stimulus (UCS) to produce a new conditioned response (CR). In other words, the CS and the UCS are associated in such a way that, when they are presented together, they produce the CR. Classical conditioning can be thought of as a form of associative learning, but it differs from other forms of associative learning in that it is based on the association between two stimuli that are not directly related to each other. The CS is called a neutral stimulus because it does not elicit any response from any other stimulus, while the UC is referred to as an aversive stimulus since it elicits a negative response from any other stimuli. Figure 7.1 shows a diagrammatic representation of how this process occurs. Figure 5.3 shows an example of classical association. You can see that when a person hears the word “cat” and sees a cat, their mouth opens and they say “cat.” This is an instance of conditioned association. When the same word is presented to the person again, this time without seeing the cat, their mouth still opens, even though they have not heard the original word. They are still associating this word with the visual stimulus that they saw before. Thus, conditioned association occurs when two stimuli, one of which is neutral, are paired together and produce an effect on a second stimulus, which is also neutral. In the following sections, we will discuss the different types of conditioning and how they differ from each other. We will also discuss how conditioning can occur in a variety of contexts, including learning to ride a bicycle, to play the piano, or to drive a car. 70 71 6 CLASSICAL CONDITIONING DISCUSSION QUESTIONS 1.

Advertising and Associative Learning
Advertising executives are pros at applying the principles of associative learning. Think about the car
commercials you have seen on television. Many of them feature an attractive model. By associating the model
with the car being advertised, you come to see the car as being desirable (Cialdini, 2008). You may be asking
yourself, does this advertising technique actually work? According to Cialdini (2008), men who viewed a car
commercial that included an attractive model later rated the car as being faster, more appealing, and better
designed than did men who viewed an advertisement for the same car minus the model.
Have you ever noticed how quickly advertisers cancel contracts with a famous athlete following a scandal? As far
as the advertiser is concerned, that athlete is no longer associated with positive feelings; therefore, the athlete
cannot be used as an unconditioned stimulus to condition the public to associate positive feelings (the
unconditioned response) with their product (the conditioned stimulus).
Now that you are aware of how associative learning works, see if you can find examples of these types of
advertisements on television, in magazines, or on the Internet.
6.3 Operant Conditioning
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Define operant conditioning
• Explain the difference between reinforcement and punishment
• Distinguish between reinforcement schedules
The previous section of this chapter focused on the type of associative learning known as classical
conditioning. Remember that in classical conditioning, something in the environment triggers a reflex
automatically, and researchers train the organism to react to a different stimulus. Now we turn to the second
type of associative learning, operant conditioning. In operant conditioning, organisms learn to associate a
behavior and its consequence (Table 6.1). A pleasant consequence makes that behavior more likely to be
repeated in the future. For example, Spirit, a dolphin at the National Aquarium in Baltimore, does a flip in the
air when her trainer blows a whistle. The consequence is that she gets a fish.

Classical and Operant Conditioning Compared
Classical Conditioning Operant Conditioning
Conditioning
approach
An unconditioned stimulus (such as food) is paired
with a neutral stimulus (such as a bell). The neutral
stimulus eventually becomes the conditioned
stimulus, which brings about the conditioned
response (salivation).
The target behavior is followed by
reinforcement or punishment to either
strengthen or weaken it, so that the
learner is more likely to exhibit the desired
behavior in the future.
Stimulus
timing
The stimulus occurs immediately before the
response.
The stimulus (either reinforcement or
punishment) occurs soon after the
response.
TABLE 6.1
Psychologist B. F. Skinner saw that classical conditioning is limited to existing behaviors that are reflexively
elicited, and it doesn’t account for new behaviors such as riding a bike. He proposed a theory about how such
behaviors come about. Skinner believed that behavior is motivated by the consequences we receive for the
behavior: the reinforcements and punishments. His idea that learning is the result of consequences is based
on the law of effect, which was first proposed by psychologist Edward Thorndike. According to the law of
effect, behaviors that are followed by consequences that are satisfying to the organism are more likely to be
repeated, and behaviors that are followed by unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated
(Thorndike, 1911). Essentially, if an organism does something that brings about a desired result, the organism
is more likely to do it again. If an organism does something that does not bring about a desired result, the
organism is less likely to do it again. An example of the law of effect is in employment. One of the reasons (and
often the main reason) we show up for work is because we get paid to do so. If we stop getting paid, we will
likely stop showing up—even if we love our job.
Working with Thorndike’s law of effect as his foundation, Skinner began conducting scientific experiments on
animals (mainly rats and pigeons) to determine how organisms learn through operant conditioning (Skinner,
1938). He placed these animals inside an operant conditioning chamber, which has come to be known as a
“Skinner box” (Figure 6.10). A Skinner box contains a lever (for rats) or disk (for pigeons) that the animal can
press or peck for a food reward via the dispenser. Speakers and lights can be associated with certain behaviors.
A recorder counts the number of responses made by the animal.

strengthened or weakened according to their consequences. (b) In a Skinner box, a rat presses a lever in an operant

6.3 • Operant Conditioning 193
LINK T O LEARNING
Watch this brief video to see Skinner's interview and a demonstration of operant conditioning of pigeons
(http://openstax.org/l/skinner1) to learn more.
In discussing operant conditioning, we use several everyday words—positive, negative, reinforcement, and
punishment—in a specialized manner. In operant conditioning, positive and negative do not mean good and
bad. Instead, positive means you are adding something, and negative means you are taking something away.
Reinforcement means you are increasing a behavior, and punishment means you are decreasing a behavior.
Reinforcement can be positive or negative, and punishment can also be positive or negative. All reinforcers
(positive or negative) increase the likelihood of a behavioral response. All punishers (positive or negative)
decrease the likelihood of a behavioral response. Now let’s combine these four terms: positive reinforcement,
negative reinforcement, positive punishment, and negative punishment (Table 6.2).
Positive and Negative Reinforcement and Punishment
Reinforcement Punishment
Positive Something is added to increase the likelihood of a
behavior.
Something is added to decrease the likelihood of a
behavior.
Negative Something is removed to increase the likelihood
of a behavior.
Something is removed to decrease the likelihood
of a behavior.
TABLE 6.2
Reinforcement
The most effective way to teach a person or animal a new behavior is with positive reinforcement. In positive
reinforcement, a desirable stimulus is added to increase a behavior.
For example, you tell your five-year-old son, Jerome, that if he cleans his room, he will get a toy. Jerome quickly
cleans his room because he wants a new art set. Let’s pause for a moment. Some people might say, “Why
should I reward my child for doing what is expected?” But in fact we are constantly and consistently rewarded
in our lives. Our paychecks are rewards, as are high grades and acceptance into our preferred school. Being
praised for doing a good job and for passing a driver’s test is also a reward. Positive reinforcement as a
learning tool is extremely effective. It has been found that one of the most effective ways to increase
achievement in school districts with below-average reading scores was to pay the children to read. Specifically,
second-grade students in Dallas were paid $2 each time they read a book and passed a short quiz about the
book. The result was a significant increase in reading comprehension (Fryer, 2010). What do you think about
this program? If Skinner were alive today, he would probably think this was a great idea. He was a strong
proponent of using operant conditioning principles to influence students’ behavior at school. In fact, in
addition to the Skinner box, he also invented what he called a teaching machine that was designed to reward
small steps in learning (Skinner, 1961)—an early forerunner of computer-assisted learning. His teaching
machine tested students’ knowledge as they worked through various school subjects. If students answered
questions correctly, they received immediate positive reinforcement and could continue; if they answered
incorrectly, they did not receive any reinforcement. The idea was that students would spend additional time
studying the material to increase their chance of being reinforced the next time (Skinner, 1961).
In negative reinforcement, an undesirable stimulus is removed to increase a behavior. For example, car
manufacturers use the principles of negative reinforcement in their seatbelt systems, which go “beep, beep,
beep” until you fasten your seatbelt. The annoying sound stops when you exhibit the desired behavior,

increasing the likelihood that you will buckle up in the future. Negative reinforcement is also used frequently
in horse training. Riders apply pressure—by pulling the reins or squeezing their legs—and then remove the
pressure when the horse performs the desired behavior, such as turning or speeding up. The pressure is the
negative stimulus that the horse wants to remove.
Punishment
Many people confuse negative reinforcement with punishment in operant conditioning, but they are two very
different mechanisms. Remember that reinforcement, even when it is negative, always increases a behavior. In
contrast, punishment always decreases a behavior. In positive punishment, you add an undesirable stimulus
to decrease a behavior. An example of positive punishment is scolding a student to get the student to stop
texting in class. In this case, a stimulus (the reprimand) is added in order to decrease the behavior (texting in
class). In negative punishment, you remove a pleasant stimulus to decrease behavior. For example, when a
child misbehaves, a parent can take away a favorite toy. In this case, a stimulus (the toy) is removed in order to
decrease the behavior.
Punishment, especially when it is immediate, is one way to decrease undesirable behavior. For example,
imagine your four-year-old son, Brandon, hit his younger brother. You have Brandon write 100 times “I will not
hit my brother"" (positive punishment). Chances are he won’t repeat this behavior. While strategies like this are
common today, in the past children were often subject to physical punishment, such as spanking. It’s
important to be aware of some of the drawbacks in using physical punishment on children. First, punishment
may teach fear. Brandon may become fearful of the street, but he also may become fearful of the person who
delivered the punishment—you, his parent. Similarly, children who are punished by teachers may come to fear
the teacher and try to avoid school (Gershoff et al., 2010). Consequently, most schools in the United States have
banned corporal punishment. Second, punishment may cause children to become more aggressive and prone
to antisocial behavior and delinquency (Gershoff, 2002). They see their parents resort to spanking when they
become angry and frustrated, so, in turn, they may act out this same behavior when they become angry and
frustrated. For example, because you spank Brenda when you are angry with her for her misbehavior, she
might start hitting her friends when they won’t share their toys.
While positive punishment can be effective in some cases, Skinner suggested that the use of punishment
should be weighed against the possible negative effects. Today’s psychologists and parenting experts favor
reinforcement over punishment—they recommend that you catch your child doing something good and reward
them for it.
Shaping
In his operant conditioning experiments, Skinner often used an approach called shaping. Instead of rewarding
only the target behavior, in shaping, we reward successive approximations of a target behavior. Why is shaping
needed? Remember that in order for reinforcement to work, the organism must first display the behavior.
Shaping is needed because it is extremely unlikely that an organism will display anything but the simplest of
behaviors spontaneously. In shaping, behaviors are broken down into many small, achievable steps. The
specific steps used in the process are the following:
1. Reinforce any response that resembles the desired behavior.
2. Then reinforce the response that more closely resembles the desired behavior. You will no longer reinforce
the previously reinforced response.
3. Next, begin to reinforce the response that even more closely resembles the desired behavior.
4. Continue to reinforce closer and closer approximations of the desired behavior.
5. Finally, only reinforce the desired behavior.
Shaping is often used in teaching a complex behavior or chain of behaviors. Skinner used shaping to teach
pigeons not only such relatively simple behaviors as pecking a disk in a Skinner box, but also many unusual
and entertaining behaviors, such as turning in circles, walking in figure eights, and even playing ping pong; the
6.3 • Operant Conditioning 195
technique is commonly used by animal trainers today. An important part of shaping is stimulus
discrimination. Recall Pavlov’s dogs—he trained them to respond to the tone of a bell, and not to similar tones
or sounds. This discrimination is also important in operant conditioning and in shaping behavior.

It’s easy to see how shaping is effective in teaching behaviors to animals, but how does shaping work with
humans? Let’s consider parents whose goal is to have their child learn to clean his room. They use shaping to
help him master steps toward the goal. Instead of performing the entire task, they set up these steps and
reinforce each step. First, he cleans up one toy. Second, he cleans up five toys. Third, he chooses whether to
pick up ten toys or put his books and clothes away. Fourth, he cleans up everything except two toys. Finally, he
cleans his entire room.
Primary and Secondary Reinforcers
Rewards such as stickers, praise, money, toys, and more can be used to reinforce learning. Let’s go back to
Skinner’s rats again. How did the rats learn to press the lever in the Skinner box? They were rewarded with
food each time they pressed the lever. For animals, food would be an obvious reinforcer.
What would be a good reinforcer for humans? For your child Chris, it was the promise of a toy when they
cleaned their room. How about Sydney, the soccer player? If you gave Sydney a piece of candy every time
Sydney scored a goal, you would be using a primary reinforcer. Primary reinforcers are reinforcers that have
innate reinforcing qualities. These kinds of reinforcers are not learned. Water, food, sleep, shelter, sex, and
touch, among others, are primary reinforcers. Pleasure is also a primary reinforcer. Organisms do not lose
their drive for these things. For most people, jumping in a cool lake on a very hot day would be reinforcing and
the cool lake would be innately reinforcing—the water would cool the person off (a physical need), as well as
provide pleasure.
A secondary reinforcer has no inherent value and only has reinforcing qualities when linked with a primary
reinforcer. Praise, linked to affection, is one example of a secondary reinforcer, as when you called out “Great
shot!” every time Sydney made a goal. Another example, money, is only worth something when you can use it
to buy other things—either things that satisfy basic needs (food, water, shelter—all primary reinforcers) or
other secondary reinforcers. If you were on a remote island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and you had
stacks of money, the money would not be useful if you could not spend it. What about the stickers on the
behavior chart? They also are secondary reinforcers.
Sometimes, instead of stickers on a sticker chart, a token is used. Tokens, which are also secondary
reinforcers, can then be traded in for rewards and prizes. Entire behavior management systems, known as
token economies, are built around the use of these kinds of token reinforcers. Token economies have been
found to be very effective at modifying behavior in a variety of settings such as schools, prisons, and mental
hospitals. For example, a study by Adibsereshki and Abkenar (2014) found that use of a token economy
increased appropriate social behaviors and reduced inappropriate behaviors in a group of eight grade
students. Similar studies show demonstrable gains on behavior and academic achievement for groups ranging
from first grade to high school, and representing a wide array of abilities and disabilities. For example, during
studies involving younger students, when children in the study exhibited appropriate behavior (not hitting or
pinching), they received a “quiet hands” token. When they hit or pinched, they lost a token. The children could
then exchange specified amounts of tokens for minutes of playtime.

Behavior Modification in Children
Parents and teachers often use behavior modification to change a child’s behavior. Behavior modification uses
the principles of operant conditioning to accomplish behavior change so that undesirable behaviors are switched
for more socially acceptable ones. Some teachers and parents create a sticker chart, in which several behaviors
are listed (Figure 6.11). Sticker charts are a form of token economies, as described in the text. Each time children
perform the behavior, they get a sticker, and after a certain number of stickers, they get a prize, or reinforcer. The
goal is to increase acceptable behaviors and decrease misbehavior. Remember, it is best to reinforce desired
behaviors, rather than to use punishment. In the classroom, the teacher can reinforce a wide range of behaviors,
from students raising their hands, to walking quietly in the hall, to turning in their homework. At home, parents
might create a behavior chart that rewards children for things such as putting away toys, brushing their teeth,
and helping with dinner. In order for behavior modification to be effective, the reinforcement needs to be
connected with the behavior; the reinforcement must matter to the child and be done consistently.
FIGURE 6.11 Sticker charts are a form of positive reinforcement and a tool for behavior modification. Once this
child earns a certain number of stickers for demonstrating a desired behavior, she will be rewarded with a trip to
the ice cream parlor. (credit: Abigail Batchelder)
Time-out is another popular technique used in behavior modification with children. It operates on the principle of
negative punishment. When a child demonstrates an undesirable behavior, they are removed from the desirable
activity at hand (Figure 6.12). For example, say that Sophia and her brother Mario are playing with building
blocks. Sophia throws some blocks at her brother, so you give her a warning that she will go to time-out if she
does it again. A few minutes later, she throws more blocks at Mario. You remove Sophia from the room for a few
minutes. When she comes back, she doesn’t throw blocks.
There are several important points that you should know if you plan to implement time-out as a behavior
modification technique. First, make sure the child is being removed from a desirable activity and placed in a less
desirable location. If the activity is something undesirable for the child, this technique will backfire because it is
more enjoyable for the child to be removed from the activity. Second, the length of the time-out is important. The
general rule of thumb is one minute for each year of the child’s age. Sophia is five; therefore, she sits in a time-
out for five minutes. Setting a timer helps children know how long they have to sit in time-out. Finally, as a
caregiver, keep several guidelines in mind over the course of a time-out: remain calm when directing your child to
time-out; ignore your child during time-out (because caregiver attention may reinforce misbehavior); and give the
child a hug or a kind word when time-out is over.

would then be removed from the activity for a short period of time. (credit a: modification of work by Simone

Reinforcement Schedules
Remember, the best way to teach a person or animal a behavior is to use positive reinforcement. For example,
Skinner used positive reinforcement to teach rats to press a lever in a Skinner box. At first, the rat might
randomly hit the lever while exploring the box, and out would come a pellet of food. After eating the pellet,
what do you think the hungry rat did next? It hit the lever again, and received another pellet of food. Each time
the rat hit the lever, a pellet of food came out. When an organism receives a reinforcer each time it displays a
behavior, it is called continuous reinforcement. This reinforcement schedule is the quickest way to teach
someone a behavior, and it is especially effective in training a new behavior. Let’s look back at the dog that was
learning to sit earlier in the chapter. Now, each time he sits, you give him a treat. Timing is important here: you
will be most successful if you present the reinforcer immediately after he sits, so that he can make an
association between the target behavior (sitting) and the consequence (getting a treat).

Once a behavior is trained, researchers and trainers often turn to another type of reinforcement
schedule—partial reinforcement. In partial reinforcement, also referred to as intermittent reinforcement, the
person or animal does not get reinforced every time they perform the desired behavior. There are several
different types of partial reinforcement schedules (Table 6.3). These schedules are described as either fixed or
variable, and as either interval or ratio. Fixed refers to the number of responses between reinforcements, or
the amount of time between reinforcements, which is set and unchanging. Variable refers to the number of
responses or amount of time between reinforcements, which varies or changes. Interval means the schedule is
based on the time between reinforcements, and ratio means the schedule is based on the number of responses
between reinforcements.

FIGURE 11.8 Alfred Adler proposed the concept of the inferiority complex.
Adler also believed in the importance of social connections, seeing childhood development emerging through
social development rather than the sexual stages Freud outlined. Adler noted the inter-relatedness of
humanity and the need to work together for the betterment of all. He said, “The happiness of mankind lies in
working together, in living as if each individual had set himself the task of contributing to the common welfare”
(Adler, 1964, p. 255) with the main goal of psychology being “to recognize the equal rights and equality of
others” (Adler, 1961, p. 691).
With these ideas, Adler identified three fundamental social tasks that all of us must experience: occupational
tasks (careers), societal tasks (friendship), and love tasks (finding an intimate partner for a long-term
relationship). Rather than focus on sexual or aggressive motives for behavior as Freud did, Adler focused on
social motives. He also emphasized conscious rather than unconscious motivation, since he believed that the
three fundamental social tasks are explicitly known and pursued. That is not to say that Adler did not also
believe in unconscious processes—he did—but he felt that conscious processes were more important.
One of Adler’s major contributions to personality psychology was the idea that our birth order shapes our
personality. He proposed that older siblings, who start out as the focus of their parents’ attention but must
share that attention once a new child joins the family, compensate by becoming overachievers. The youngest
children, according to Adler, may be spoiled, leaving the middle child with the opportunity to minimize the
negative dynamics of the youngest and oldest children. Despite popular attention, research has not
conclusively confirmed Adler’s hypotheses about birth order.

Erik Erikson
As an art school dropout with an uncertain future, young Erik Erikson met Freud’s daughter, Anna Freud, while
he was tutoring the children of an American couple undergoing psychoanalysis in Vienna. It was Anna Freud
who encouraged Erikson to study psychoanalysis. Erikson received his diploma from the Vienna
Psychoanalytic Institute in 1933, and as Nazism spread across Europe, he fled the country and immigrated to
the United States that same year. As you learned when you studied lifespan development, Erikson later
proposed a psychosocial theory of development, suggesting that an individual’s personality develops
throughout the lifespan—a departure from Freud’s view that personality is fixed in early life. In his theory,
Erikson emphasized the social relationships that are important at each stage of personality development, in
contrast to Freud’s emphasis on sex. Erikson identified eight stages, each of which represents a conflict or
developmental task (Table 11.2). The development of a healthy personality and a sense of competence depend
on the successful completion of each task.

Carl Jung
Carl Jung (Figure 11.9) was a Swiss psychiatrist and protégé of Freud, who later split off from Freud and
developed his own theory, which he called analytical psychology. The focus of analytical psychology is on
working to balance opposing forces of conscious and unconscious thought, and experience within one’s
personality. According to Jung, this work is a continuous learning process—mainly occurring in the second half
of life—of becoming aware of unconscious elements and integrating them into consciousness.

FIGURE 11.9 Carl Jung was interested in exploring the collective unconscious.
Jung’s split from Freud was based on two major disagreements. First, Jung, like Adler and Erikson, did not
accept that sexual drive was the primary motivator in a person’s mental life. Second, although Jung agreed
with Freud’s concept of a personal unconscious, he thought it to be incomplete. In addition to the personal
unconscious, Jung focused on the collective unconscious.
The collective unconscious is a universal version of the personal unconscious, holding mental patterns, or
memory traces, which are common to all of us (Jung, 1928). These ancestral memories, which Jung called
archetypes, are represented by universal themes in various cultures, as expressed through literature, art, and
dreams (Jung). Jung said that these themes reflect common experiences of people the world over, such as
facing death, becoming independent, and striving for mastery. Jung (1964) believed that through biology, each
person is handed down the same themes and that the same types of symbols—such as the hero, the maiden,
the sage, and the trickster—are present in the folklore and fairy tales of every culture. In Jung’s view, the task of
integrating these unconscious archetypal aspects of the self is part of the self-realization process in the second
half of life. With this orientation toward self-realization, Jung parted ways with Freud’s belief that personality is
determined solely by past events and anticipated the humanistic movement with its emphasis on self-
actualization and orientation toward the future.
Jung also proposed two attitudes or approaches toward life: extroversion and introversion (Jung, 1923) (Table
11.3). These ideas are considered Jung’s most important contributions to the field of personality psychology,
as almost all models of personality now include these concepts. If you are an extrovert, then you are a person
who is energized by being outgoing and socially oriented: You derive your energy from being around others. If
you are an introvert, then you are a person who may be quiet and reserved, or you may be social, but your
energy is derived from your inner psychic activity. Jung believed a balance between extroversion and
introversion best served the goal of self-realization.

TABLE 11.3
Another concept proposed by Jung was the persona, which he referred to as a mask that we adopt. According
to Jung, we consciously create this persona; however, it is derived from both our conscious experiences and
our collective unconscious. What is the purpose of the persona? Jung believed that it is a compromise between
who we really are (our true self) and what society expects us to be. We hide those parts of ourselves that are not
aligned with society’s expectations.

Jung’s view of extroverted and introverted types serves as a basis of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI).

Are Archetypes Genetically Based?
Jung proposed that human responses to archetypes are similar to instinctual responses in animals. One criticism of
Jung is that there is no evidence that archetypes are biologically based or similar to animal instincts (Roesler, 2012).
Jung formulated his ideas about 100 years ago, and great advances have been made in the field of genetics since
that time. We’ve found that human babies are born with certain capacities, including the ability to acquire language.
However, we’ve also found that symbolic information (such as archetypes) is not encoded on the genome and that
babies cannot decode symbolism, refuting the idea of a biological basis to archetypes. Rather than being seen as
purely biological, more recent research suggests that archetypes emerge directly from our experiences and are
reflections of linguistic or cultural characteristics (Young-Eisendrath, 1995). Today, most Jungian scholars believe
that the collective unconscious and archetypes are based on both innate and environmental influences, with the
differences being in the role and degree of each (Sotirova-Kohli et al., 2013).
Karen Horney
Karen Horney was one of the first women trained as a Freudian psychoanalyst. During the Great Depression,
Horney moved from Germany to the United States, and subsequently moved away from Freud’s teachings. Like
Jung, Horney believed that each individual has the potential for self-realization and that the goal of
psychoanalysis should be moving toward a healthy self rather than exploring early childhood patterns of

dysfunction. Horney also disagreed with the Freudian idea that girls have penis envy and are jealous of male
biological features. According to Horney, any jealousy is most likely culturally based, due to the greater
privileges that men often have, meaning that the differences between men’s and women’s personalities are
culturally based, not biologically based. She further suggested that men have womb envy, because they cannot
give birth.
Horney’s theories focused on the role of unconscious anxiety. She suggested that normal growth can be
blocked by basic anxiety stemming from needs not being met, such as childhood experiences of loneliness
and/or isolation. How do children learn to handle this anxiety? Horney suggested three styles of coping (Table
11.4). The first coping style, moving toward people, relies on affiliation and dependence. These children
become dependent on their parents and other caregivers in an effort to receive attention and affection, which
provides relief from anxiety (Burger, 2008). When these children grow up, they tend to use this same coping
strategy to deal with relationships, expressing an intense need for love and acceptance (Burger, 2008). The
second coping style, moving against people, relies on aggression and assertiveness. Children with this coping
style find that fighting is the best way to deal with an unhappy home situation, and they deal with their feelings
of insecurity by bullying other children (Burger, 2008). As adults, people with this coping style tend to lash out
with hurtful comments and exploit others (Burger, 2008). The third coping style, moving away from people,
centers on detachment and isolation. These children handle their anxiety by withdrawing from the world. They
need privacy and tend to be self-sufficient. When these children are adults, they continue to avoid such things
as love and friendship, and they also tend to gravitate toward careers that require little interaction with others
(Burger, 2008).

Horney believed these three styles are ways in which people typically cope with day-to-day problems; however,
the three coping styles can become neurotic strategies if they are used rigidly and compulsively, leading a
person to become alienated from others.

In contrast to the psychodynamic approaches of Freud and the neo-Freudians, which relate personality to
inner (and hidden) processes, the learning approaches focus only on observable behavior. This illustrates one
significant advantage of the learning approaches over psychodynamics: Because learning approaches involve
observable, measurable phenomena, they can be scientifically tested.

As you watch the video, look closely at Little Albert’s reactions and the manner in which Watson and Rayner present the stimuli before and after conditioning. Based on what you see, would you come to the same conclusions as the researchers? Advertising and Associative Learning Advertising executives are pros at applying the principles of associative learning. Think about the car commercials you have seen on television. Many of them feature an attractive model. By associating the model with the car being advertised, you come to see the car as being desirable (Cialdini, 2008). You may be asking yourself, does this advertising technique actually work? According to Cialdini (2008), men who viewed a car commercial that included an attractive model later rated the car as being faster, more appealing, and better designed than did men who viewed an advertisement for the same car minus the model. Have you ever noticed how quickly advertisers cancel contracts with a famous athlete following a scandal? As far as the advertiser is concerned, that athlete is no longer associated with positive feelings; therefore, the athlete cannot be used as an unconditioned stimulus to condition the public to associate positive feelings (the unconditioned response) with their product (the conditioned stimulus). Now that you are aware of how associative learning works, see if you can find examples of these types of advertisements on television, in magazines, or on the Internet. 6.3 Operant Conditioning LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Define operant conditioning • Explain the difference between reinforcement and punishment • Distinguish between reinforcement schedules The previous section of this chapter focused on the type of associative learning known as classical conditioning. Remember that in classical conditioning, something in the environment triggers a reflex automatically, and researchers train the organism to react to a different stimulus. Now we turn to the second type of associative learning, operant conditioning. In operant conditioning, organisms learn through the application of consequences. For example, if a dog is trained to salivate at the sound of a bell, then the dog will learn that the bell will cause the salivation to occur. This is an example of positive reinforcement. If, on the other hand, a person is taught to drink a glass of orange juice when he or she sees a picture of an orange, then the person will learn the association of the orange picture with the drink. The orange is the conditioned stimulus (CS), and drinking the juice will produce the response (R). The association between the CS and R is referred to as a positive association (PA). In this case, there is a reinforcement schedule (RS) that is used to produce the PA. In the next two sections, we will look at two different schedules of reinforcement: fixed-interval and fixed-ratio. We will also discuss the differences between positive and negative reinforcement, as well as between punishment and positive punishment. Fixed-Ratio Schedules of Reinforcement Reinforcement schedules are divided into two main categories: interval schedules and ratio schedules. Interval schedules are the most common and are also the easiest to understand. An interval schedule is defined as one in which the reinforcement is given at a fixed interval of time after the stimulus is presented. A ratio schedule is defined by the number of times a stimulus must be presented in order to elicit the desired response. The following table shows the two most commonly used intervals and ratios. Interval Schedule Ratio Schedule 1:1 3:2 2:3 4:5 5:4 6:7 7:6 8:9 9:8 In this table, each row represents an interval and each column represents a ratio. You can see that there are several different ratios and intervals that are used in different situations. Let’s take a closer look and see how these schedules work. Suppose you want to increase the frequency of your dog salivating when you give him a treat after he salivates. You can do this by giving him the treat every 5 minutes. Or, suppose you wanted to make sure that every time you give him his treat, he will respond to it. To accomplish this, it would be best to give the treats at fixed intervals of time (e.g., every minute, every hour, etc.). In other words, when the time between treats is fixed (i.e., fixed interval","{""sections"": [""Learning"", ""Learning/Observational Learning (Modeling)"", ""Personality/Trait Theorists""], ""pages"": [""208"", ""206"", ""383""]}"
18,"during the early 20th century at Johns Hopkins University (Figure 1.5). While Wundt and James were
concerned with understanding conscious experience, Watson thought that the study of consciousness was
flawed. Because he believed that objective analysis of the mind was impossible, Watson preferred to focus
directly on observable behavior and try to bring that behavior under control. Watson was a major proponent of
shifting the focus of psychology from the mind to behavior, and this approach of observing and controlling
behavior came to be known as behaviorism. A major object of study by behaviorists was learned behavior and
its interaction with inborn qualities of the organism. Behaviorism commonly used animals in experiments
under the assumption that what was learned using animal models could, to some degree, be applied to human
behavior. Indeed, Tolman (1938) stated, “I believe that everything important in psychology (except … such
matters as involve society and words) can be investigated in essence through the continued experimental and
theoretical analysis of the determiners of rat behavior at a choice-point in a maze.”
FIGURE 1.5 John B. Watson is known as the father of behaviorism within psychology.
Behaviorism dominated experimental psychology for several decades, and its influence can still be felt today
(Thorne & Henley, 2005). Behaviorism is largely responsible for establishing psychology as a scientific
discipline through its objective methods and especially experimentation. In addition, it is used in behavioral
and cognitive-behavioral therapy. Behavior modification is commonly used in classroom settings. Behaviorism
has also led to research on environmental influences on human behavior.
B. F. Skinner (1904–1990) was an American psychologist (Figure 1.6). Like Watson, Skinner was a behaviorist,
and he concentrated on how behavior was affected by its consequences. Therefore, Skinner spoke of
reinforcement and punishment as major factors in driving behavior. As a part of his research, Skinner
developed a chamber that allowed the careful study of the principles of modifying behavior through
reinforcement and punishment. This device, known as an operant conditioning chamber (or more familiarly, a
Skinner box), has remained a crucial resource for researchers studying behavior (Thorne & Henley, 2005).

conditioning chamber, or Skinner box, are still widely used in research settings today. (credit a: modification of work

1.2 • History of Psychology 13
The Skinner box is a chamber that isolates the subject from the external environment and has a behavior
indicator such as a lever or a button. When the animal pushes the button or lever, the box is able to deliver a
positive reinforcement of the behavior (such as food) or a punishment (such as a noise).
Skinner’s focus on positive and negative reinforcement of learned behaviors had a lasting influence in
psychology that has waned somewhat since the growth of research in cognitive psychology. Despite this,
conditioned learning is still used in human behavioral modification (Greengrass, 2004).
Maslow, Rogers, and Humanism
During the early 20th century, American psychology was dominated by behaviorism and psychoanalysis.
However, some psychologists were uncomfortable with what they viewed as limited perspectives being so
influential to the field. They objected to the pessimism and determinism (all actions driven by the
unconscious) of Freud. They also disliked the reductionism, or simplifying nature, of behaviorism.
Behaviorism is also deterministic at its core, because it sees human behavior as entirely determined by a
combination of genetics and environment. Some psychologists began to form their own ideas that emphasized
personal control, intentionality, and a true predisposition for “good” as important for our self-concept and our
behavior. Thus, humanism emerged. Humanism is a perspective within psychology that emphasizes the
potential for good that is innate to all humans. Two of the most well-known proponents of humanistic
psychology are Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers (O’Hara, n.d.).
Abraham Maslow (1908–1970) was an American psychologist who is best known for proposing a hierarchy of
human needs in motivating behavior (Figure 1.7). Although this concept will be discussed in more detail in a
later chapter, a brief overview will be provided here. Maslow asserted that so long as basic needs necessary for
survival were met (e.g., food, water, shelter), higher-level needs (e.g., social needs) would begin to motivate
behavior. According to Maslow, the highest-level needs relate to self-actualization, a process by which we
achieve our full potential. Obviously, the focus on the positive aspects of human nature that are characteristic
of the humanistic perspective is evident (Thorne & Henley, 2005). Humanistic psychologists rejected, on
principle, the research approach based on reductionist experimentation in the tradition of the physical and
biological sciences, because it missed the “whole” human being. Beginning with Maslow and Rogers, there was
an insistence on a humanistic research program. This program has been largely qualitative (not
measurement-based), but there exist a number of quantitative research strains within humanistic psychology,
including research on happiness, self-concept, meditation, and the outcomes of humanistic psychotherapy
(Friedman, 2008).

FIGURE 1.7 Maslow’s hierarchy of needs is shown.
Carl Rogers (1902–1987) was also an American psychologist who, like Maslow, emphasized the potential for
good that exists within all people (Figure 1.8). Rogers used a therapeutic technique known as client-centered
therapy in helping his clients deal with problematic issues that resulted in their seeking psychotherapy. Unlike
a psychoanalytic approach in which the therapist plays an important role in interpreting what conscious
behavior reveals about the unconscious mind, client-centered therapy involves the patient taking a lead role in
the therapy session. Rogers believed that a therapist needed to display three features to maximize the
effectiveness of this particular approach: unconditional positive regard, genuineness, and empathy.
Unconditional positive regard refers to the fact that the therapist accepts their client for who they are, no
matter what they might say. Provided these factors, Rogers believed that people were more than capable of
dealing with and working through their own issues (Thorne & Henley, 2005).

Humanism has been influential to psychology as a whole. Both Maslow and Rogers are well-known names
among students of psychology (you will read more about both later in this text), and their ideas have influenced
many scholars. Furthermore, Rogers’ client-centered approach to therapy is still commonly used in
psychotherapeutic settings today (O’hara, n.d.)

The Cognitive Revolution
Behaviorism’s emphasis on objectivity and focus on external behavior had pulled psychologists’ attention away
from the mind for a prolonged period of time. The early work of the humanistic psychologists redirected
attention to the individual human as a whole, and as a conscious and self-aware being. By the 1950s, new
disciplinary perspectives in linguistics, neuroscience, and computer science were emerging, and these areas
revived interest in the mind as a focus of scientific inquiry. This particular perspective has come to be known
as the cognitive revolution (Miller, 2003). By 1967, Ulric Neisser published the first textbook entitled Cognitive
Psychology, which served as a core text in cognitive psychology courses around the country (Thorne & Henley,
2005).
Although no one person is entirely responsible for starting the cognitive revolution, Noam Chomsky was very
influential in the early days of this movement (Figure 1.9). Chomsky (1928–), an American linguist, was
dissatisfied with the influence that behaviorism had had on psychology. He believed that psychology’s focus on
behavior was short-sighted and that the field had to re-incorporate mental functioning into its purview if it
were to offer any meaningful contributions to understanding behavior (Miller, 2003).
FIGURE 1.9 Noam Chomsky was very influential in beginning the cognitive revolution. In 2010, this mural honoring
him was put up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (credit: Robert Moran)
European psychology had never really been as influenced by behaviorism as had American psychology; and
thus, the cognitive revolution helped reestablish lines of communication between European psychologists and
their American counterparts. Furthermore, psychologists began to cooperate with scientists in other fields,
like anthropology, linguistics, computer science, and neuroscience, among others. This interdisciplinary
approach often was referred to as the cognitive sciences, and the influence and prominence of this particular
perspective resonates in modern-day psychology (Miller, 2003).
Feminist Psychology
The science of psychology has had an impact on human wellbeing, both positive and negative. The dominant
influence of Western, White, and male academics in the early history of psychology meant that psychology
developed with the biases inherent in those individuals, which often had negative consequences for members of
society who were not White or male. Women, members of ethnic minorities in both the United States and other
countries, and individuals with sexual orientations other than straight had difficulties entering the field of
psychology and therefore influencing its development. They also suffered from the attitudes of White male
psychologists who were not immune to the nonscientific attitudes prevalent in the society in which they

developed and worked. Until the 1960s, the science of psychology was largely a “womanless” psychology
(Crawford & Marecek, 1989), meaning that few women were able to practice psychology, so they had little
influence on what was studied. In addition, the experimental subjects of psychology were mostly men, which
resulted from underlying assumptions that gender had no influence on psychology and that women were not of
sufficient interest to study.
An article by Naomi Weisstein, first published in 1968 (Weisstein, 1993), stimulated a feminist revolution in
psychology by presenting a critique of psychology as a science. She also specifically criticized male psychologists
for constructing the psychology of women entirely out of their own cultural biases and without careful
experimental tests to verify any of their characterizations of women. Weisstein used, as examples, statements by
prominent psychologists in the 1960s, such as this quote by Bruno Bettleheim: “We must start with the
realization that, as much as women want to be good scientists or engineers, they want first and foremost to be
womanly companions of men and to be mothers.” Weisstein’s critique formed the foundation for the subsequent
development of a feminist psychology that attempted to be free of the influence of male cultural biases on our
knowledge of the psychology of women.
Crawford & Marecek (1989) identify several feminist approaches to psychology that can be described as feminist
psychology. These include re-evaluating and discovering the contributions of women to the history of psychology,
studying psychological gender differences, and questioning the male bias present across the practice of the
scientific approach to knowledge.
Multicultural And Cross-Cultural Psychology
Culture impacts individuals, groups, and society. An ongoing issue researchers are trying to correct is that
certain populations have been over-studied and the results of these studies have been applied to other
populations. For example, Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan discuss how WEIRD societies have been
overstudied and the results have been wrongly applied to non-WEIRD societies (2010). WEIRD stands for
western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic. Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan found that there are
many differences between people in the WEIRD group and people in less industrialized, less urban, and non-
Western societies. These differences occur in a variety of areas, including perception, cooperation, and moral
reasoning. That is, people vary depending on their culture and environment. Multicultural psychologists
develop theories and conduct research with diverse populations, typically within one country. Cross-cultural
psychologists compare populations across countries, such as participants from the United States compared to
participants from China.
In 1920, Francis Cecil Sumner was the first African American to receive a PhD in psychology in the United
States. Sumner established a psychology degree program at Howard University, leading to the education of a
new generation of African American psychologists (Black, Spence, and Omari, 2004). Much of the work of early
psychologists from diverse backgrounds was dedicated to challenging intelligence testing and promoting
innovative educational methods for children. George I. Sanchez contested such testing with Mexican American
children. As a psychologist of Mexican heritage, he pointed out that the language and cultural barriers in
testing were keeping children from equal opportunities (Guthrie, 1998). By 1940, he was teaching with his
doctoral degree at University of Texas at Austin and challenging segregated educational practices (Romo,
1986).
Two famous African American researchers and psychologists are Mamie Phipps Clark and her husband,
Kenneth Clark. They are best known for their studies conducted on African American children and doll
preference, research that was instrumental in the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court desegregation
case. The Clarks applied their research to social services and opened the first child guidance center in Harlem
(American Psychological Association, 2019).

Extensions of drive theory take into account levels of arousal as potential motivators. As you recall from your
study of learning, these theories assert that there is an optimal level of arousal that we all try to maintain
(Figure 10.6). If we are underaroused, we become bored and will seek out some sort of stimulation. On the
other hand, if we are overaroused, we will engage in behaviors to reduce our arousal (Berlyne, 1960). Most
students have experienced this need to maintain optimal levels of arousal over the course of their academic
career. Think about how much stress students experience toward the end of spring semester. They feel
overwhelmed with seemingly endless exams, papers, and major assignments that must be completed on time.
They probably yearn for the rest and relaxation that awaits them over the extended summer break. However,
once they finish the semester, it doesn’t take too long before they begin to feel bored. Generally, by the time the
next semester is beginning in the fall, many students are quite happy to return to school. This is an example of
how arousal theory works.
FIGURE 10.6 The concept of optimal arousal in relation to performance on a task is depicted here. Performance is
maximized at the optimal level of arousal, and it tapers off during under- and overarousal.
So what is the optimal level of arousal? What level leads to the best performance? Research shows that
moderate arousal is generally best; when arousal is very high or very low, performance tends to suffer (Yerkes
& Dodson, 1908). Think of your arousal level regarding taking an exam for this class. If your level is very low,
such as boredom and apathy, your performance will likely suffer. Similarly, a very high level, such as extreme
anxiety, can be paralyzing and hinder performance. Consider the example of a softball team facing a
tournament. They are favored to win their first game by a large margin, so they go into the game with a lower
level of arousal and get beat by a less skilled team.
But optimal arousal level is more complex than a simple answer that the middle level is always best.
Researchers Robert Yerkes (pronounced “Yerk-EES”) and John Dodson discovered that the optimal arousal
level depends on the complexity and difficulty of the task to be performed (Figure 10.7). This relationship is
known as Yerkes-Dodson law, which holds that a simple task is performed best when arousal levels are
relatively high and complex tasks are best performed when arousal levels are lower.
10.1 • Motivation 325
FIGURE 10.7 Task performance is best when arousal levels are in a middle range, with difficult tasks best
performed under lower levels of arousal and simple tasks best performed under higher levels of arousal.
Self-efficacy and Social Motives
Self-efficacy is an individual’s belief in their own capability to complete a task, which may include a previous
successful completion of the exact task or a similar task. Albert Bandura (1994) theorized that an individual’s
sense of self-efficacy plays a pivotal role in motivating behavior. Bandura argues that motivation derives from
expectations that we have about the consequences of our behaviors, and ultimately, it is the appreciation of our
capacity to engage in a given behavior that will determine what we do and the future goals that we set for
ourselves. For example, if you have a sincere belief in your ability to achieve at the highest level, you are more
likely to take on challenging tasks and to not let setbacks dissuade you from seeing the task through to the end.
A number of theorists have focused their research on understanding social motives (McAdams & Constantian,
1983; McClelland & Liberman, 1949; Murray et al., 1938). Among the motives they describe are needs for
achievement, affiliation, and intimacy. It is the need for achievement that drives accomplishment and
performance. The need for affiliation encourages positive interactions with others, and the need for intimacy
causes us to seek deep, meaningful relationships. Henry Murray et al. (1938) categorized these needs into
domains. For example, the need for achievement and recognition falls under the domain of ambition.
Dominance and aggression were recognized as needs under the domain of human power, and play was a
recognized need in the domain of interpersonal affection.
Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs
While the theories of motivation described earlier relate to basic biological drives, individual characteristics,
or social contexts, Abraham Maslow (1943) proposed a hierarchy of needs that spans the spectrum of motives
ranging from the biological to the individual to the social. These needs are often depicted as a pyramid (Figure
10.8).
326 10 • Emotion and Motivation
Access for free at openstax.org
FIGURE 10.8 Maslow’s hierarchy of needs is illustrated here. In some versions of the pyramid, cognitive and
aesthetic needs are also included between esteem and self-actualization. Others include another tier at the top of
the pyramid for self-transcendence.
At the base of the pyramid are all of the physiological needs that are necessary for survival. These are followed
by basic needs for security and safety, the need to be loved and to have a sense of belonging, and the need to
have self-worth and confidence. The top tier of the pyramid is self-actualization, which is a need that
essentially equates to achieving one’s full potential, and it can only be realized when needs lower on the
pyramid have been met. To Maslow and humanistic theorists, self-actualization reflects the humanistic
emphasis on positive aspects of human nature. Maslow suggested that this is an ongoing, life-long process and
that only a small percentage of people actually achieve a self-actualized state (Francis & Kritsonis, 2006;
Maslow, 1943).
According to Maslow (1943), one must satisfy lower-level needs before addressing those needs that occur
higher in the pyramid. So, for example, if someone is struggling to find enough food to meet their nutritional
requirements, it is quite unlikely that they would spend an inordinate amount of time thinking about whether
others viewed them as a good person or not. Instead, all of their energies would be geared toward finding
something to eat. However, it should be pointed out that Maslow’s theory has been criticized for its subjective
nature and its inability to account for phenomena that occur in the real world (Leonard, 1982). Other research
has more recently addressed that late in life, Maslow proposed a self-transcendence level above self-
actualization—to represent striving for meaning and purpose beyond the concerns of oneself (Koltko-Rivera,
2006). For example, people sometimes make self-sacrifices in order to make a political statement or in an
attempt to improve the conditions of others. Mohandas K. Gandhi, a world-renowned advocate for
independence through nonviolent protest, on several occasions went on hunger strikes to protest a particular
situation. People may starve themselves or otherwise put themselves in danger displaying higher-level
motives beyond their own needs.

10.2 Hunger and Eating
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe how hunger and eating are regulated
• Differentiate between levels of overweight and obesity and the associated health consequences
• Explain the health consequences resulting from anorexia and bulimia nervosa
Eating is essential for survival, and it is no surprise that a drive like hunger exists to ensure that we seek out
sustenance. While this chapter will focus primarily on the physiological mechanisms that regulate hunger and
eating, powerful social, cultural, and economic influences also play important roles. This section will explain
the regulation of hunger, eating, and body weight, and we will discuss the adverse consequences of disordered
eating.
Physiological Mechanisms
There are a number of physiological mechanisms that serve as the basis for hunger. When our stomachs are
empty, they contract. Typically, a person then experiences hunger pangs. Chemical messages travel to the
brain, and serve as a signal to initiate feeding behavior. When our blood glucose levels drop, the pancreas and
liver generate a number of chemical signals that induce hunger (Konturek et al., 2003; Novin, Robinson,
Culbreth, & Tordoff, 1985) and thus initiate feeding behavior.
For most people, once they have eaten, they feel satiation, or fullness and satisfaction, and their eating
behavior stops. Like the initiation of eating, satiation is also regulated by several physiological mechanisms. As
blood glucose levels increase, the pancreas and liver send signals to shut off hunger and eating (Drazen &
Woods, 2003; Druce, Small, & Bloom, 2004; Greary, 1990). The food’s passage through the gastrointestinal
tract also provides important satiety signals to the brain (Woods, 2004), and fat cells release leptin, a satiety
hormone.
The various hunger and satiety signals that are involved in the regulation of eating are integrated in the brain.
Research suggests that several areas of the hypothalamus and hindbrain are especially important sites where
this integration occurs (Ahima & Antwi, 2008; Woods & D’Alessio, 2008). Ultimately, activity in the brain
determines whether or not we engage in feeding behavior (Figure 10.9).

integrated in the brain.
Metabolism and Body Weight
Our body weight is affected by a number of factors, including gene-environment interactions, and the number
of calories we consume versus the number of calories we burn in daily activity. If our caloric intake exceeds
our caloric use, our bodies store excess energy in the form of fat. If we consume fewer calories than we burn
off, then stored fat will be converted to energy. Our energy expenditure is obviously affected by our levels of
activity, but our body’s metabolic rate also comes into play. A person’s metabolic rate is the amount of energy
that is expended in a given period of time, and there is tremendous individual variability in our metabolic
rates. People with high rates of metabolism are able to burn off calories more easily than those with lower rates
of metabolism.
We all experience fluctuations in our weight from time to time, but generally, most people’s weights fluctuate
within a narrow margin, in the absence of extreme changes in diet and/or physical activity. This observation
led some to propose a set-point theory of body weight regulation. The set-point theory asserts that each
individual has an ideal body weight, or set point, which is resistant to change. This set-point is genetically
predetermined and efforts to move our weight significantly from the set-point are resisted by compensatory
changes in energy intake and/or expenditure (Speakman et al., 2011).
Some of the predictions generated from this particular theory have not received empirical support. For
example, there are no changes in metabolic rate between individuals who had recently lost significant
amounts of weight and a control group (Weinsier et al., 2000). In addition, the set-point theory fails to account
for the influence of social and environmental factors in the regulation of body weight (Martin-Gronert &
Ozanne, 2013; Speakman et al., 2011). Despite these limitations, set-point theory is still often used as a simple,
intuitive explanation of how body weight is regulated. See Psychological Disorders for further discussion about
eating disorders.
Obesity
When someone weighs more than what is generally accepted as healthy for a given height, they are considered
overweight or obese. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an adult with a body
10.2 • Hunger and Eating 329
include your beliefs and values, and your past experiences with similar behaviors. Finally, context refers to the
reward structure for the behavior. According to reciprocal determinism, all of these factors are in play.
Observational Learning
Bandura’s key contribution to learning theory was the idea that much learning is vicarious. We learn by
observing someone else’s behavior and its consequences, which Bandura called observational learning. He felt
that this type of learning also plays a part in the development of our personality. Just as we learn individual
behaviors, we learn new behavior patterns when we see them performed by other people or models. Drawing
on the behaviorists’ ideas about reinforcement, Bandura suggested that whether we choose to imitate a
model’s behavior depends on whether we see the model reinforced or punished. Through observational
learning, we come to learn what behaviors are acceptable and rewarded in our culture, and we also learn to
inhibit deviant or socially unacceptable behaviors by seeing what behaviors are punished.
We can see the principles of reciprocal determinism at work in observational learning. For example, personal
factors determine which behaviors in the environment a person chooses to imitate, and those environmental
events in turn are processed cognitively according to other personal factors. One person may experience
receiving attention as reinforcing, and that person may be more inclined to imitate behaviors such as boasting
when a model has been reinforced. For others, boasting may be viewed negatively, despite the attention that
might result—or receiving heightened attention may be perceived as being scrutinized. In either case, the
person may be less likely to imitate those behaviors even though the reasons for not doing so would be
different.
Self-Efficacy
Bandura (1977, 1995) has studied a number of cognitive and personal factors that affect learning and
personality development, and most recently has focused on the concept of self-efficacy. Self-efficacy is our
level of confidence in our own abilities, developed through our social experiences. Self-efficacy affects how we
approach challenges and reach goals. In observational learning, self-efficacy is a cognitive factor that affects
which behaviors we choose to imitate as well as our success in performing those behaviors.
People who have high self-efficacy believe that their goals are within reach, have a positive view of challenges
seeing them as tasks to be mastered, develop a deep interest in and strong commitment to the activities in
which they are involved, and quickly recover from setbacks. Conversely, people with low self-efficacy avoid
challenging tasks because they doubt their ability to be successful, tend to focus on failure and negative
outcomes, and lose confidence in their abilities if they experience setbacks. Feelings of self-efficacy can be
specific to certain situations. For instance, a student might feel confident in her ability in English class but
much less so in math class.
Julian Rotter and Locus of Control
Julian Rotter (1966) proposed the concept of locus of control, another cognitive factor that affects learning and
personality development. Distinct from self-efficacy, which involves our belief in our own abilities, locus of
control refers to our beliefs about the power we have over our lives. In Rotter’s view, people possess either an
internal or an external locus of control (Figure 11.11). Those of us with an internal locus of control (“internals”)
tend to believe that most of our outcomes are the direct result of our efforts. Those of us with an external locus
of control (“externals”) tend to believe that our outcomes are outside of our control. Externals see their lives as
being controlled by other people, luck, or chance. For example, say you didn’t spend much time studying for
your psychology test and went out to dinner with friends instead. When you receive your test score, you see
that you earned a D. If you possess an internal locus of control, you would most likely admit that you failed
because you didn’t spend enough time studying and decide to study more for the next test. On the other hand,
if you possess an external locus of control, you might conclude that the test was too hard and not bother
studying for the next test, because you figure you will fail it anyway. Researchers have found that people with
an internal locus of control perform better academically, achieve more in their careers, are more independent,
11.4 • Learning Approaches 375
are healthier, are better able to cope, and are less depressed than people who have an external locus of control
(Benassi, Sweeney, & Durfour, 1988; Lefcourt, 1982; Maltby, Day, & Macaskill, 2007; Whyte, 1977, 1978, 1980).

Walter Mischel and the Person-Situation Debate
Walter Mischel was a student of Julian Rotter and taught for years at Stanford, where he was a colleague of
Albert Bandura. Mischel surveyed several decades of empirical psychological literature regarding trait
prediction of behavior, and his conclusion shook the foundations of personality psychology. Mischel found that
the data did not support the central principle of the field—that a person’s personality traits are consistent
across situations. His report triggered a decades-long period of self-examination, known as the person-
situation debate, among personality psychologists.
Mischel suggested that perhaps we were looking for consistency in the wrong places. He found that although
behavior was inconsistent across different situations, it was much more consistent within situations—so that a
person’s behavior in one situation would likely be repeated in a similar one. And as you will see next regarding
his famous “marshmallow test,” Mischel also found that behavior is consistent in equivalent situations across
time.
One of Mischel’s most notable contributions to personality psychology was his ideas on self-regulation.
According to Lecci & Magnavita (2013), “Self-regulation is the process of identifying a goal or set of goals and,
in pursuing these goals, using both internal (e.g., thoughts and affect) and external (e.g., responses of anything
or anyone in the environment) feedback to maximize goal attainment” (p. 6.3). Self-regulation is also known as
will power. When we talk about will power, we tend to think of it as the ability to delay gratification. For
example, Bettina’s teenage son made strawberry cupcakes, and they looked delicious. However, Bettina
forfeited the pleasure of eating one, because she is training for a 5K race and wants to be fit and do well in the
race. Would you be able to resist getting a small reward now in order to get a larger reward later? This is the
question Mischel investigated in his now-classic marshmallow test.
Mischel designed a study to assess self-regulation in young children. In the marshmallow study, Mischel and
his colleagues placed a preschool child in a room with one marshmallow on the table. The children were told
they could either eat the marshmallow now, or wait until the researcher returned to the room, and then they
could have two marshmallows (Mischel, Ebbesen & Raskoff, 1972). This was repeated with hundreds of
preschoolers. What Mischel and his team found was that young children differ in their degree of self-control.
Mischel and his colleagues continued to follow this group of preschoolers through high school, and what do
you think they discovered? The children who had more self-control in preschool (the ones who waited for the
bigger reward) were more successful in high school. They had higher SAT scores, had positive peer
relationships, and were less likely to have substance abuse issues; as adults, they also had more stable
marriages (Mischel, Shoda, & Rodriguez, 1989; Mischel et al., 2010). On the other hand, those children who had
poor self-control in preschool (the ones who grabbed the one marshmallow) were not as successful in high
school, and they were found to have academic and behavioral problems. A more recent study using a larger
and more representative sample found associations between early delay of gratification (Watts, Duncan, &
376 11 • Personality

Quan, 2018) and measures of achievement in adolescence. However, researchers also found that the
associations were not as strong as those reported during Mischel's initial experiment and were quite sensitive
to situational factors such as early measures of cognitive capacity, family background, and home environment.
This research suggests that consideration of situational factors is important to better understand behavior.

more and to see the test given to children in Colombia.
Today, the debate is mostly resolved, and most psychologists consider both the situation and personal factors
in understanding behavior. For Mischel (1993), people are situation processors. The children in the
marshmallow test each processed, or interpreted, the rewards structure of that situation in their own way.
Mischel’s approach to personality stresses the importance of both the situation and the way the person
perceives the situation. Instead of behavior being determined by the situation, people use cognitive processes
to interpret the situation and then behave in accordance with that interpretation.
11.5 Humanistic Approaches
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Discuss the contributions of Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers to personality development
As the “third force” in psychology, humanism is touted as a reaction both to the pessimistic determinism of
psychoanalysis, with its emphasis on psychological disturbance, and to the behaviorists’ view of humans
passively reacting to the environment, which has been criticized as making people out to be personality-less
robots. It does not suggest that psychoanalytic, behaviorist, and other points of view are incorrect but argues
that these perspectives do not recognize the depth and meaning of human experience, and fail to recognize the
innate capacity for self-directed change and transforming personal experiences. This perspective focuses on
how healthy people develop. One pioneering humanist, Abraham Maslow, studied people who he considered to
be healthy, creative, and productive, including Albert Einstein, Eleanor Roosevelt, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham
Lincoln, and others. Maslow (1950, 1970) found that such people share similar characteristics, such as being
open, creative, loving, spontaneous, compassionate, concerned for others, and accepting of themselves. When
you studied motivation, you learned about one of the best-known humanistic theories, Maslow's hierarchy of
needs theory, in which Maslow proposes that human beings have certain needs in common and that these
needs must be met in a certain order. The highest need is the need for self-actualization, which is the
achievement of our fullest potential. Maslow differentiated between needs that motivate us to fulfill something
that is missing and needs that inspire us to grow. He believed that many emotional and behavioral concerns
arise as a result of failing to meet these hierarchical needs.
Another humanistic theorist was Carl Rogers. One of Rogers’s main ideas about personality regards self-
concept, our thoughts and feelings about ourselves. How would you respond to the question, “Who am I?” Your
answer can show how you see yourself. If your response is primarily positive, then you tend to feel good about
who you are, and you see the world as a safe and positive place. If your response is mainly negative, then you
may feel unhappy with who you are. Rogers further divided the self into two categories: the ideal self and the
real self. The ideal self is the person that you would like to be; the real self is the person you actually are.
Rogers focused on the idea that we need to achieve consistency between these two selves. We experience
congruence when our thoughts about our real self and ideal self are very similar—in other words, when our
self-concept is accurate. High congruence leads to a greater sense of self-worth and a healthy, productive life.
Parents can help their children achieve this by giving them unconditional positive regard, or unconditional
love. According to Rogers (1980), “As persons are accepted and prized, they tend to develop a more caring
attitude towards themselves” (p. 116). Conversely, when there is a great discrepancy between our ideal and
11.5 • Humanistic Approaches 377
actual selves, we experience a state Rogers called incongruence, which can lead to maladjustment. Both
Rogers’s and Maslow’s theories focus on individual choices and do not believe that biology is deterministic.
11.6 Biological Approaches
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Discuss the findings of the Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart as they relate to personality and genetics
• Discuss temperament and describe the three infant temperaments identified by Thomas and Chess
• Discuss the evolutionary perspective on personality development
How much of our personality is in-born and biological, and how much is influenced by the environment and
culture we are raised in? Psychologists who favor the biological approach believe that inherited
predispositions as well as physiological processes can be used to explain differences in our personalities
(Burger, 2008).
Evolutionary psychology relative to personality development looks at personality traits that are universal, as
well as differences across individuals. In this view, adaptive differences have evolved and then provide a
survival and reproductive advantage. Individual differences are important from an evolutionary viewpoint for
several reasons. Certain individual differences, and the heritability of these characteristics, have been well
documented. David Buss has identified several theories to explore this relationship between personality traits
and evolution, such as life-history theory, which looks at how people expend their time and energy (such as on
bodily growth and maintenance, reproduction, or parenting). Another example is costly signaling theory,
which examines the honesty and deception in the signals people send one another about their quality as a
mate or friend (Buss, 2009).
In the field of behavioral genetics, the Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart—a well-known study of the
genetic basis for personality—conducted research with twins from 1979 to 1999. In studying 350 pairs of
twins, including pairs of identical and fraternal twins reared together and apart, researchers found that
identical twins, whether raised together or apart, have very similar personalities (Bouchard, 1994; Bouchard,
Lykken, McGue, Segal, & Tellegen, 1990; Segal, 2012). These findings suggest the heritability of some
personality traits. Heritability refers to the proportion of difference among people that is attributed to
genetics. Some of the traits that the study reported as having more than a 0.50 heritability ratio include
leadership, obedience to authority, a sense of well-being, alienation, resistance to stress, and fearfulness. The
implication is that some aspects of our personalities are largely controlled by genetics; however, it’s important
to point out that traits are not determined by a single gene, but by a combination of many genes, as well as by
epigenetic factors that control whether the genes are expressed.
Other research that has examined the link between personality and other factors has identified and studied
Type A and Type B personalities, which you will learn more about in the chapter on Stress, Health, and
Lifestyle.

Temperament
Most contemporary psychologists believe temperament has a biological basis due to its appearance very early
in our lives (Rothbart, 2011). As you learned when you studied lifespan development, Thomas and Chess
(1977) found that babies could be categorized into one of three temperaments: easy, difficult, or slow to warm
up. However, environmental factors (family interactions, for example) and maturation can affect the ways in
which children’s personalities are expressed (Carter et al., 2008).

Research suggests that there are two dimensions of our temperament that are important parts of our adult
personality—reactivity and self-regulation (Rothbart, Ahadi, & Evans, 2000). Reactivity refers to how we
respond to new or challenging environmental stimuli; self-regulation refers to our ability to control that
response (Rothbart & Derryberry, 1981; Rothbart, Sheese, Rueda, & Posner, 2011). For example, one person
may immediately respond to new stimuli with a high level of anxiety, while another barely notices it.
11.7 Trait Theorists
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Discuss early trait theories of Cattell and Eysenck
• Discuss the Big Five factors and describe someone who is high and low on each of the five factors
Trait theorists believe personality can be understood via the approach that all people have certain traits, or
characteristic ways of behaving. Do you tend to be sociable or shy? Passive or aggressive? Optimistic or
pessimistic? Moody or even-tempered? Early trait theorists tried to describe all human personality traits. For
example, one trait theorist, Gordon Allport (Allport & Odbert, 1936), found 4,500 words in the English language
that could describe people. He organized these personality traits into three categories: cardinal traits, central
traits, and secondary traits. A cardinal trait is one that dominates your entire personality, and hence your
life—such as Ebenezer Scrooge’s greed and Mother Theresa’s altruism. Cardinal traits are not very common:
Few people have personalities dominated by a single trait. Instead, our personalities typically are composed of
multiple traits. Central traits are those that make up our personalities (such as loyal, kind, agreeable, friendly,
sneaky, wild, and grouchy). Secondary traits are those that are not quite as obvious or as consistent as central
traits. They are present under specific circumstances and include preferences and attitudes. For example, one
person gets angry when people try to tickle him; another can only sleep on the left side of the bed; and yet
another always orders her salad dressing on the side. And you—although not normally an anxious person—feel
nervous before making a speech in front of your English class.
In an effort to make the list of traits more manageable, Raymond Cattell (1946, 1957) narrowed down the list to
about 171 traits. However, saying that a trait is either present or absent does not accurately reflect a person’s
uniqueness, because all of our personalities are actually made up of the same traits; we differ only in the
degree to which each trait is expressed. Cattell (1957) identified 16 factors or dimensions of personality:
warmth, reasoning, emotional stability, dominance, liveliness, rule-consciousness, social boldness, sensitivity,
vigilance, abstractedness, privateness, apprehension, openness to change, self-reliance, perfectionism, and
tension (Table 11.5). He developed a personality assessment based on these 16 factors, called the 16PF.
Instead of a trait being present or absent, each dimension is scored over a continuum, from high to low. For
example, your level of warmth describes how warm, caring, and nice to others you are. If you score low on this
index, you tend to be more distant and cold. A high score on this index signifies you are supportive and
comforting.
Personality Factors Measured by the 16PF Questionnaire
Factor Low Score High Score
Warmth Reserved, detached Outgoing, supportive
Intellect Concrete thinker Analytical
Emotional stability Moody, irritable Stable, calm
Aggressiveness Docile, submissive Controlling, dominant

Watson was a major proponent of shifting the focus of psychology from the mind to behavior, and this approach of observing and controlling behavior came to be known as behaviorism. A major object of study by behaviorists was learned behavior and its interaction with inborn qualities of the organism. Behaviorism commonly used animals in experiments under the assumption that what was learned using animal models could, to some degree, be applied to human behavior. Indeed, Tolman (1938) stated, “I believe that everything important in psychology (except … such matters as involve society and words) can be investigated in essence through the continued experimental and theoretical analysis of the determiners of rat behavior at a choice-point in a maze.” FIGURE 1.5 John B.

Behaviorism has also led to research on environmental influences on human behavior. B. F. Skinner (1904–1990) was an American psychologist (Figure 1.6). Like Watson, Skinner was a behaviorist, and he concentrated on how behavior was affected by its consequences. Therefore, Skinner spoke of reinforcement and punishment as major factors in driving behavior. As a part of his research, Skinner developed a chamber that allowed the careful study of the principles of modifying behavior through reinforcement and punishment. This device, known as an operant conditioning chamber (or more familiarly, a Skinner box), has remained a popular tool for studying the effects of punishment and reinforcement on behaviors. The Skinner box has been used to study a wide range of behaviors, including learning, memory, problem solving, decision making, fear, anxiety, aggression, addiction, self-control, learning disabilities, learning disabilities, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and many others. It has also been used in the development of behavioral therapies, such as aversion therapy and systematic desensitization. Figure 1. 6 B. F.

1.2 • History of Psychology 13
The Skinner box is a chamber that isolates the subject from the external environment and has a behavior
indicator such as a lever or a button. When the animal pushes the button or lever, the box is able to deliver a
positive reinforcement of the behavior (such as food) or a punishment (such as a noise).
Skinner’s focus on positive and negative reinforcement of learned behaviors had a lasting influence in
psychology that has waned somewhat since the growth of research in cognitive psychology. Despite this,
conditioned learning is still used in human behavioral modification (Greengrass, 2004).
Maslow, Rogers, and Humanism
During the early 20th century, American psychology was dominated by behaviorism and psychoanalysis.
However, some psychologists were uncomfortable with what they viewed as limited perspectives being so
influential to the field. They objected to the pessimism and determinism (all actions driven by the
unconscious) of Freud. They also disliked the reductionism, or simplifying nature, of behaviorism.
Behaviorism is also deterministic at its core, because it sees human behavior as entirely determined by a
combination of genetics and environment. Some psychologists began to form their own ideas that emphasized
personal control, intentionality, and a true predisposition for “good” as important for our self-concept and our
behavior. Thus, humanism emerged. Humanism is a perspective within psychology that emphasizes the
potential for good that is innate to all humans. Two of the most well-known proponents of humanistic
psychology are Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers (O’Hara, n.d.).
Abraham Maslow (1908–1970) was an American psychologist who is best known for proposing a hierarchy of
human needs in motivating behavior (Figure 1.7). Although this concept will be discussed in more detail in a
later chapter, a brief overview will be provided here. Maslow asserted that so long as basic needs necessary for
survival were met (e.g., food, water, shelter), higher-level needs (e.g., social needs) would begin to motivate
behavior. According to Maslow, the highest-level needs relate to self-actualization, a process by which we
achieve our full potential. Obviously, the focus on the positive aspects of human nature that are characteristic
of the humanistic perspective is evident (Thorne & Henley, 2005). Humanistic psychologists rejected, on
principle, the research approach based on reductionist experimentation in the tradition of the physical and
biological sciences, because it missed the “whole” human being. Beginning with Maslow and Rogers, there was
an insistence on a humanistic research program. This program has been largely qualitative (not
measurement-based), but there exist a number of quantitative research strains within humanistic psychology,
including research on happiness, self-concept, meditation, and the outcomes of humanistic psychotherapy
(Friedman, 2008).

FIGURE 1.7 Maslow’s hierarchy of needs is shown.
Carl Rogers (1902–1987) was also an American psychologist who, like Maslow, emphasized the potential for
good that exists within all people (Figure 1.8). Rogers used a therapeutic technique known as client-centered
therapy in helping his clients deal with problematic issues that resulted in their seeking psychotherapy. Unlike
a psychoanalytic approach in which the therapist plays an important role in interpreting what conscious
behavior reveals about the unconscious mind, client-centered therapy involves the patient taking a lead role in
the therapy session. Rogers believed that a therapist needed to display three features to maximize the
effectiveness of this particular approach: unconditional positive regard, genuineness, and empathy.
Unconditional positive regard refers to the fact that the therapist accepts their client for who they are, no
matter what they might say. Provided these factors, Rogers believed that people were more than capable of
dealing with and working through their own issues (Thorne & Henley, 2005).
FIGURE 1.8 Carl Rogers, shown in this portrait, developed a client-centered therapy method that has been
influential in clinical settings. (credit: ""Didius""/Wikimedia Commons)
Humanism has been influential to psychology as a whole. Both Maslow and Rogers are well-known names
among students of psychology (you will read more about both later in this text), and their ideas have influenced
many scholars. Furthermore, Rogers’ client-centered approach to therapy is still commonly used in
psychotherapeutic settings today (O’hara, n.d.)

The Cognitive Revolution
Behaviorism’s emphasis on objectivity and focus on external behavior had pulled psychologists’ attention away
from the mind for a prolonged period of time. The early work of the humanistic psychologists redirected
attention to the individual human as a whole, and as a conscious and self-aware being. By the 1950s, new
disciplinary perspectives in linguistics, neuroscience, and computer science were emerging, and these areas
revived interest in the mind as a focus of scientific inquiry. This particular perspective has come to be known
as the cognitive revolution (Miller, 2003). By 1967, Ulric Neisser published the first textbook entitled Cognitive
Psychology, which served as a core text in cognitive psychology courses around the country (Thorne & Henley,
2005).
Although no one person is entirely responsible for starting the cognitive revolution, Noam Chomsky was very
influential in the early days of this movement (Figure 1.9). Chomsky (1928–), an American linguist, was
dissatisfied with the influence that behaviorism had had on psychology. He believed that psychology’s focus on
behavior was short-sighted and that the field had to re-incorporate mental functioning into its purview if it
were to offer any meaningful contributions to understanding behavior (Miller, 2003).
FIGURE 1.9 Noam Chomsky was very influential in beginning the cognitive revolution. In 2010, this mural honoring
him was put up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (credit: Robert Moran)
European psychology had never really been as influenced by behaviorism as had American psychology; and
thus, the cognitive revolution helped reestablish lines of communication between European psychologists and
their American counterparts. Furthermore, psychologists began to cooperate with scientists in other fields,
like anthropology, linguistics, computer science, and neuroscience, among others. This interdisciplinary
approach often was referred to as the cognitive sciences, and the influence and prominence of this particular
perspective resonates in modern-day psychology (Miller, 2003).
Feminist Psychology
The science of psychology has had an impact on human wellbeing, both positive and negative. The dominant
influence of Western, White, and male academics in the early history of psychology meant that psychology
developed with the biases inherent in those individuals, which often had negative consequences for members of
society who were not White or male. Women, members of ethnic minorities in both the United States and other
countries, and individuals with sexual orientations other than straight had difficulties entering the field of
psychology and therefore influencing its development. They also suffered from the attitudes of White male
psychologists who were not immune to the nonscientific attitudes prevalent in the society in which they

developed and worked. Until the 1960s, the science of psychology was largely a “womanless” psychology
(Crawford & Marecek, 1989), meaning that few women were able to practice psychology, so they had little
influence on what was studied. In addition, the experimental subjects of psychology were mostly men, which
resulted from underlying assumptions that gender had no influence on psychology and that women were not of
sufficient interest to study.
An article by Naomi Weisstein, first published in 1968 (Weisstein, 1993), stimulated a feminist revolution in
psychology by presenting a critique of psychology as a science. She also specifically criticized male psychologists
for constructing the psychology of women entirely out of their own cultural biases and without careful
experimental tests to verify any of their characterizations of women. Weisstein used, as examples, statements by
prominent psychologists in the 1960s, such as this quote by Bruno Bettleheim: “We must start with the
realization that, as much as women want to be good scientists or engineers, they want first and foremost to be
womanly companions of men and to be mothers.” Weisstein’s critique formed the foundation for the subsequent
development of a feminist psychology that attempted to be free of the influence of male cultural biases on our
knowledge of the psychology of women.
Crawford & Marecek (1989) identify several feminist approaches to psychology that can be described as feminist
psychology. These include re-evaluating and discovering the contributions of women to the history of psychology,
studying psychological gender differences, and questioning the male bias present across the practice of the
scientific approach to knowledge.
Multicultural And Cross-Cultural Psychology
Culture impacts individuals, groups, and society. An ongoing issue researchers are trying to correct is that
certain populations have been over-studied and the results of these studies have been applied to other
populations. For example, Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan discuss how WEIRD societies have been
overstudied and the results have been wrongly applied to non-WEIRD societies (2010). WEIRD stands for
western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic. Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan found that there are
many differences between people in the WEIRD group and people in less industrialized, less urban, and non-
Western societies. These differences occur in a variety of areas, including perception, cooperation, and moral
reasoning. That is, people vary depending on their culture and environment. Multicultural psychologists
develop theories and conduct research with diverse populations, typically within one country. Cross-cultural
psychologists compare populations across countries, such as participants from the United States compared to
participants from China.
In 1920, Francis Cecil Sumner was the first African American to receive a PhD in psychology in the United
States. Sumner established a psychology degree program at Howard University, leading to the education of a
new generation of African American psychologists (Black, Spence, and Omari, 2004). Much of the work of early
psychologists from diverse backgrounds was dedicated to challenging intelligence testing and promoting
innovative educational methods for children. George I. Sanchez contested such testing with Mexican American
children. As a psychologist of Mexican heritage, he pointed out that the language and cultural barriers in
testing were keeping children from equal opportunities (Guthrie, 1998). By 1940, he was teaching with his
doctoral degree at University of Texas at Austin and challenging segregated educational practices (Romo,
1986).
Two famous African American researchers and psychologists are Mamie Phipps Clark and her husband,
Kenneth Clark. They are best known for their studies conducted on African American children and doll
preference, research that was instrumental in the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court desegregation
case. The Clarks applied their research to social services and opened the first child guidance center in Harlem
(American Psychological Association, 2019).

1.4 Careers in Psychology
Clive Wearing is an accomplished musician who lost his ability to form new memories when
he became sick at the age of 46. While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember
what he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is
associated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend’s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John
Nash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would
tell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended
for him. He also began to hear voices and became suspicious of the people around him. Soon thereafter, Nash
was diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a state-run mental institution (O’Connor & Robertson,
1Introduction to Psychology
2002). Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these
experiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain’s internal
processes and people’s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of
psychology has explored these questions.
1.1 What Is Psychology?
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Define psychology
• Understand the merits of an education in psychology
What is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology
explores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists
use the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question
about how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the
phenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or
group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over
time. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes
observations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then
published or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.
Scientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because
it is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We
must ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However,
we can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus,
psychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.
In general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot
arrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the
mind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific
method is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on
observation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or
previous authorities.
It was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this
time, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is,
at its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological
organism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore,
psychology is also a social science.
WHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?
Often, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to
learn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course
because it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as
nursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare
psychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses
across the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology
majors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook’s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality
and political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About
6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S.
Department of Education, 2016).

An education in psychology is valuable for a number of reasons. Psychology students hone critical thinking
skills and are trained in the use of the scientific method. Critical thinking is the active application of a set of
skills to information for the understanding and evaluation of that information. The evaluation of
information—assessing its reliability and usefulness— is an important skill in a world full of competing “facts,”
many of which are designed to be misleading. For example, critical thinking involves maintaining an attitude
of skepticism, recognizing internal biases, making use of logical thinking, asking appropriate questions, and
making observations. Psychology students also can develop better communication skills during the course of
their undergraduate coursework (American Psychological Association, 2011). Together, these factors increase
students’ scientific literacy and prepare students to critically evaluate the various sources of information they
encounter.
In addition to these broad-based skills, psychology students come to understand the complex factors that
shape one’s behavior. They appreciate the interaction of our biology, our environment, and our experiences in
determining who we are and how we will behave. They learn about basic principles that guide how we think
and behave, and they come to recognize the tremendous diversity that exists across individuals and across
cultural boundaries (American Psychological Association, 2011).

example, to human physiology, which dates much earlier. As mentioned, anyone interested in exploring issues
related to the mind generally did so in a philosophical context prior to the 19th century. Two 19th century
scholars, Wilhelm Wundt and William James, are generally credited as being the founders of psychology as a
science and academic discipline that was distinct from philosophy. This section will provide an overview of the
shifts in paradigms that have influenced psychology from Wundt and James through today.
Wundt and Structuralism
Wilhelm Wundt (1832–1920) was a German scientist who was the first person to be referred to as a
psychologist. His famous book entitled Principles of Physiological Psychology was published in 1873. Wundt
viewed psychology as a scientific study of conscious experience, and he believed that the goal of psychology
was to identify components of consciousness and how those components combined to result in our conscious
experience. Wundt used introspection (he called it “internal perception”), a process by which someone
examines their own conscious experience as objectively as possible, making the human mind like any other
aspect of nature that a scientist observed. He believed in the notion of voluntarism—that people have free will
and should know the intentions of a psychological experiment if they were participating (Danziger, 1980).
Wundt considered his version experimental introspection; he used instruments such as those that measured
reaction time. He also wrote Volkerpsychologie in 1904 in which he suggested that psychology should include
the study of culture, as it involves the study of people. Edward Titchener, one of his students, went on to
1.2 • History of Psychology 9
develop structuralism. Its focus was on the contents of mental processes rather than their function (Pickren &
Rutherford, 2010). Wundt established his psychology laboratory at the University at Leipzig in 1879 (Figure
1.2). In this laboratory, Wundt and his students conducted experiments on, for example, reaction times. A
subject, sometimes in a room isolated from the scientist, would receive a stimulus such as a light, image, or
sound. The subject’s reaction to the stimulus would be to push a button, and an apparatus would record the
time to reaction. Wundt could measure reaction time to one-thousandth of a second (Nicolas & Ferrand, 1999).
FIGURE 1.2 (a) Wilhelm Wundt is credited as one of the founders of psychology. He created the first laboratory for
psychological research. (b) This photo shows him seated and surrounded by fellow researchers and equipment in
his laboratory in Germany.
However, despite his efforts to train individuals in the process of introspection, this process remained highly
subjective, and there was very little agreement between individuals.
Functionalism
William James, John Dewey, and Charles Sanders Peirce helped establish functional psychology (Figure 1.3).
They accepted Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection and viewed this theory as an explanation of an
organism’s characteristics. Key to that theory is the idea that natural selection leads to organisms that are
adapted to their environment, including their behavior. Adaptation means that a trait of an organism has a
function for the survival and reproduction of the individual, because it has been naturally selected. As James
saw it, psychology’s purpose was to study the function of behavior in the world, and as such, his perspective
was known as functionalism. Functionalism focused on how mental activities helped an organism fit into its
environment. Functionalism has a second, more subtle meaning in that functionalists were more interested in
the operation of the whole mind rather than of its individual parts, which were the focus of structuralism. Like
Wundt, James believed that introspection could serve as one means by which someone might study mental
activities, but James also relied on more objective measures, including the use of various recording devices,
and examinations of concrete products of mental activities and of anatomy and physiology (Gordon, 1995).

4-year institutions and use these opportunities to gain experience in teaching. Furthermore, many 2-year
colleges and schools need faculty to teach their courses in psychology. In general, many of the people who
pursue careers at these institutions have master’s degrees in psychology, although some PhDs make careers at
these institutions as well.
Some people earning PhDs may enjoy research in an academic setting. However, they may not be interested in
teaching. These individuals might take on faculty positions that are exclusively devoted to conducting
research. This type of position would be more likely an option at large, research-focused universities.
In some areas in psychology, it is common for individuals who have recently earned their PhD to seek out
positions in postdoctoral training programs that are available before going on to serve as faculty. In most
cases, young scientists will complete one or two postdoctoral programs before applying for a full-time faculty
position. Postdoctoral training programs allow young scientists to further develop their research programs
and broaden their research skills under the supervision of other professionals in the field.
Career Options Outside of Academic Settings
Individuals who wish to become practicing clinical psychologists have another option for earning a doctoral
degree, which is known as a PsyD. A PsyD is a doctor of psychology degree that is increasingly popular among
individuals interested in pursuing careers in clinical psychology. PsyD programs generally place less emphasis
on research-oriented skills and focus more on application of psychological principles in the clinical context
(Norcross & Castle, 2002).
Regardless of whether earning a PhD or PsyD, in most states, an individual wishing to practice as a licensed
clinical or counseling psychologist may complete postdoctoral work under the supervision of a licensed
psychologist. Within the last few years, however, several states have begun to remove this requirement, which
would allow people to get an earlier start in their careers (Munsey, 2009). After an individual has met the state
requirements, their credentials are evaluated to determine whether they can sit for the licensure exam. Only
individuals that pass this exam can call themselves licensed clinical or counseling psychologists (Norcross,
n.d.). Licensed clinical or counseling psychologists can then work in a number of settings, ranging from private
clinical practice to hospital settings. It should be noted that clinical psychologists and psychiatrists do different
things and receive different types of education. While both can conduct therapy and counseling, clinical
psychologists have a PhD or a PsyD, whereas psychiatrists have a doctor of medicine degree (MD). As such,
licensed clinical psychologists can administer and interpret psychological tests, while psychiatrists can
prescribe medications.
Individuals earning a PhD can work in a variety of settings, depending on their areas of specialization. For
example, someone trained as a biopsychologist might work in a pharmaceutical company to help test the
efficacy of a new drug. Someone with a clinical background might become a forensic psychologist and work
within the legal system to make recommendations during criminal trials and parole hearings, or serve as an
expert in a court case.
While earning a doctoral degree in psychology is a lengthy process, usually taking between 5–6 years of
graduate study (DeAngelis, 2010), there are a number of careers that can be attained with a master’s degree in
psychology. People who wish to provide psychotherapy can become licensed to serve as various types of
professional counselors (Hoffman, 2012). Relevant master’s degrees are also sufficient for individuals seeking
careers as school psychologists (National Association of School Psychologists, n.d.), in some capacities related
to sport psychology (American Psychological Association, 2014), or as consultants in various industrial
settings (Landers, 2011, June 14). Undergraduate coursework in psychology may be applicable to other careers
such as psychiatric social work or psychiatric nursing, where assessments and therapy may be a part of the
job.
As mentioned in the opening section of this chapter, an undergraduate education in psychology is associated
with a knowledge base and skill set that many employers find quite attractive. It should come as no surprise,

then, that individuals earning bachelor’s degrees in psychology find themselves in a number of different
careers, as shown in Table 1.1. Examples of a few such careers can involve serving as case managers, working
in sales, working in human resource departments, and teaching in high schools. The rapidly growing realm of
healthcare professions is another field in which an education in psychology is helpful and sometimes required.
For example, the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) exam that people must take to be admitted to medical
school now includes a section on the psychological foundations of behavior.

Summary
1.1 What Is Psychology?
Psychology is defined as the scientific study of mind and behavior. Students of psychology develop critical
thinking skills, become familiar with the scientific method, and recognize the complexity of behavior.
1.2 History of Psychology
Before the time of Wundt and James, questions about the mind were considered by philosophers. However,
both Wundt and James helped create psychology as a distinct scientific discipline. Wundt was a structuralist,
which meant he believed that our cognitive experience was best understood by breaking that experience into
its component parts. He thought this was best accomplished by introspection.

William James was the first American psychologist, and he was a proponent of functionalism. This particular
perspective focused on how mental activities served as adaptive responses to an organism’s environment. Like
Wundt, James also relied on introspection; however, his research approach also incorporated more objective
measures as well.
Sigmund Freud believed that understanding the unconscious mind was absolutely critical to understand
conscious behavior. This was especially true for individuals that he saw who suffered from various hysterias
and neuroses. Freud relied on dream analysis, slips of the tongue, and free association as means to access the
unconscious. Psychoanalytic theory remained a dominant force in clinical psychology for several decades.
Gestalt psychology was very influential in Europe. Gestalt psychology takes a holistic view of an individual and
his experiences. As the Nazis came to power in Germany, Wertheimer, Koffka, and Köhler immigrated to the
United States. Although they left their laboratories and their research behind, they did introduce America to
Gestalt ideas. Some of the principles of Gestalt psychology are still very influential in the study of sensation
and perception.
One of the most influential schools of thought within psychology’s history was behaviorism. Behaviorism
focused on making psychology an objective science by studying overt behavior and deemphasizing the
importance of unobservable mental processes. John Watson is often considered the father of behaviorism, and
B. F. Skinner’s contributions to our understanding of principles of operant conditioning cannot be
underestimated.
As behaviorism and psychoanalytic theory took hold of so many aspects of psychology, some began to become
dissatisfied with psychology’s picture of human nature. Thus, a humanistic movement within psychology
began to take hold. Humanism focuses on the potential of all people for good. Both Maslow and Rogers were
influential in shaping humanistic psychology.
During the 1950s, the landscape of psychology began to change. A science of behavior began to shift back to its
roots of focus on mental processes. The emergence of neuroscience and computer science aided this
transition. Ultimately, the cognitive revolution took hold, and people came to realize that cognition was crucial
to a true appreciation and understanding of behavior.
1.3 Contemporary Psychology
Psychology is a diverse discipline that is made up of several major subdivisions with unique perspectives.
Biological psychology involves the study of the biological bases of behavior. Sensation and perception refer to
the area of psychology that is focused on how information from our sensory modalities is received, and how
this information is transformed into our perceptual experiences of the world around us. Cognitive psychology
is concerned with the relationship that exists between thought and behavior, and developmental psychologists
study the physical and cognitive changes that occur throughout one’s lifespan. Personality psychology focuses
on individuals’ unique patterns of behavior, thought, and emotion. Industrial and organizational psychology,
health psychology, sport and exercise psychology, forensic psychology, and clinical psychology are all
considered applied areas of psychology. Industrial and organizational psychologists apply psychological
concepts to I-O settings. Health psychologists look for ways to help people live healthier lives, and clinical
psychology involves the diagnosis and treatment of psychological disorders and other problematic behavioral
patterns. Sport and exercise psychologists study the interactions between thoughts, emotions, and physical
performance in sports, exercise, and other activities. Forensic psychologists carry out activities related to
psychology in association with the justice system.
1.4 Careers in Psychology
Generally, academic careers in psychology require doctoral degrees. However, there are a number of
nonacademic career options for people who have master’s degrees in psychology. While people with bachelor’s
degrees in psychology have more limited psychology-related career options, the skills acquired as a function of

On the night of February 26, 2012, Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old African American high
school student, was shot by a neighborhood watch volunteer, George Zimmerman, in a predominantly White
neighborhood. Zimmerman observed the boy dressed in a hoodie and pursued Martin. Zimmerman called the
police to report a person acting suspiciously, which he had done on other occasions. According to the 911 call
transcript, Zimmerman said on the call, ""[expletive] punks. These [expletive], they always get away."" The 911
operator told Zimmerman not to follow the teen, as was also stated in the police neighborhood watch
guidelines that had been provided to Zimmerman. A physical altercation ended with Zimmerman fatally
shooting Martin. Zimmerman claimed that he acted in self-defense. Martin was unarmed, and after his death,
there was a nationwide outcry. A Florida jury found Zimmerman not guilty of second degree murder nor of
manslaughter.
There have also been tragic situations with deadly consequences in which police officers have shot innocent
civilians. In 2019, Atatiana Jefferson's neighbor used a non-emergency line to call the police because
Jefferson's front door was open in the late hours of the night. The police arrived and an officer went to the back
of the yard. Jefferson, not knowing that the police had been called, reached into her purse and got out her
legally owned gun. The officer perceived a threat and fired upon Jefferson, killing her. Her 8-year-old nephew

witnessed the incident, as he was playing video games with his aunt. Why did each of these nights end so
tragically for those involved? What dynamics contributed to the outcomes? How can these deaths be
prevented?
Social psychologists examine how the presence of others impacts how a person behaves and reacts, whether
that person is an athlete playing a game, a police officer on the job, or a worshiper attending a religious service.
Social psychologists believe that a person's behavior is influenced by who else is present in a given situation
and the composition of social groups.
12.1 What Is Social Psychology?
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Define social psychology
• Describe situational versus dispositional influences on behavior
• Describe the fundamental attribution error
• Explain actor-observer bias
• Describe self-serving bias
• Explain the just-world hypothesis
Social psychology examines how people affect one another, and it looks at the power of the situation.
According to the American Psychological Association (n.d.), social psychologists ""are interested in all aspects
of personality and social interaction, exploring the influence of interpersonal and group relationships on
human behavior."" Throughout this chapter, we will examine how the presence of other individuals and groups
of people impacts a person's behaviors, thoughts, and feelings. Essentially, people will change their behavior to
align with the social situation at hand. If we are in a new situation or are unsure how to behave, we will take our
cues from other individuals.
The field of social psychology studies topics at both the intra- and interpersonal levels. Intrapersonal topics
(those that pertain to the individual) include emotions and attitudes, the self, and social cognition (the ways in
which we think about ourselves and others). Interpersonal topics (those that pertain to dyads and groups)
include helping behavior (Figure 12.2), aggression, prejudice and discrimination, attraction and close
relationships, and group processes and intergroup relationships.
FIGURE 12.2 Social psychology deals with all kinds of interactions between people, spanning a wide range of how
we connect: from moments of confrontation to moments of working together and helping others, as shown here.
(credit: Sgt. Derec Pierson, U.S. Army)
Social psychologists focus on how people conceptualize and interpret situations and how these interpretations
influence their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors (Ross & Nisbett, 1991). Thus, social psychology studies
individuals in a social context and how situational variables interact to influence behavior. In this chapter, we
discuss the intrapersonal processes of self-presentation, cognitive dissonance and attitude change, and the
400 12 • Social Psychology

interpersonal processes of conformity and obedience, aggression and altruism, and, finally, love and
attraction.
Situational and Dispositional Influences on Behavior
Behavior is a product of both the situation (e.g., cultural influences, social roles, and the presence of
bystanders) and of the person (e.g., personality characteristics). Subfields of psychology tend to focus on one
influence or behavior over others. Situationism is the view that our behavior and actions are determined by
our immediate environment and surroundings. In contrast, dispositionism holds that our behavior is
determined by internal factors (Heider, 1958). An internal factor is an attribute of a person and includes
personality traits and temperament. Social psychologists have tended to take the situationist perspective,
whereas personality psychologists have promoted the dispositionist perspective. Modern approaches to social
psychology, however, take both the situation and the individual into account when studying human behavior
(Fiske, Gilbert, & Lindzey, 2010). In fact, the field of social-personality psychology has emerged to study the
complex interaction of internal and situational factors that affect human behavior (Mischel, 1977; Richard,
Bond, & Stokes-Zoota, 2003).
Fundamental Attribution Error
In the United States, the predominant culture tends to favor a dispositional approach in explaining human
behavior. Why do you think this is? We tend to think that people are in control of their own behaviors, and,
therefore, any behavior change must be due to something internal, such as their personality, habits, or
temperament. According to some social psychologists, people tend to overemphasize internal factors as
explanations—or attributions—for the behavior of other people. They tend to assume that the behavior of
another person is a trait of that person, and to underestimate the power of the situation on the behavior of
others. They tend to fail to recognize when the behavior of another is due to situational variables, and thus to
the person’s state. This erroneous assumption is called the fundamental attribution error (Ross, 1977; Riggio
& Garcia, 2009). To better understand, imagine this scenario: Jamie returns home from work, and opens the
front door to a happy greeting from spouse Morgan who inquires how the day has been. Instead of returning
the spouse’s kind greeting, Jamie yells, “Leave me alone!” Why did Jamie yell? How would someone
committing the fundamental attribution error explain Jamie’s behavior? The most common response is that
Jamie is a mean, angry, or unfriendly person (traits). This is an internal or dispositional explanation. However,
imagine that Jamie was just laid off from work due to company downsizing. Would your explanation for Jamie’s
behavior change? Your revised explanation might be that Jamie was frustrated and disappointed about being
laid off and was therefore in a bad mood (state). This is now an external or situational explanation for Jamie’s
behavior.
The fundamental attribution error is so powerful that people often overlook obvious situational influences on
behavior. A classic example was demonstrated in a series of experiments known as the quizmaster study (Ross,
Amabile, & Steinmetz, 1977). Student participants were randomly assigned to play the role of a questioner (the
quizmaster) or a contestant in a quiz game. Questioners developed difficult questions to which they knew the
answers, and they presented these questions to the contestants. The contestants answered the questions
correctly only 4 out of 10 times (Figure 12.3). After the task, the questioners and contestants were asked to rate
their own general knowledge compared to the average student. Questioners did not rate their general
knowledge higher than the contestants, but the contestants rated the questioners’ intelligence higher than
their own. In a second study, observers of the interaction also rated the questioner as having more general
knowledge than the contestant. The obvious influence on performance is the situation. The questioners wrote
the questions, so of course they had an advantage. Both the contestants and observers made an internal
attribution for the performance. They concluded that the questioners must be more intelligent than the
contestants.

FIGURE 12.3 In the quizmaster study, people tended to disregard the influence of the situation and wrongly
concluded that a questioner’s knowledge was greater than their own. (credit: Steve Jurvetson)
The halo effect refers to the tendency to let the overall impression of an individual color the way in which we
feel about their character. For instance, we might assume that people who are physically attractive are more
likely to be good people than less attractive individuals. Another example of how the halo effect might manifest
would involve assuming that someone whom we perceive to be outgoing or friendly has a better moral
character than someone who is not.
As demonstrated in the examples above, the fundamental attribution error is considered a powerful influence
in how we explain the behaviors of others. However, it should be noted that some researchers have suggested
that the fundamental attribution error may not be as powerful as it is often portrayed. In fact, a recent review
of more than 173 published studies suggests that several factors (e.g., high levels of idiosyncrasy of the
character and how well hypothetical events are explained) play a role in determining just how influential the
fundamental attribution error is (Malle, 2006).
Is the Fundamental Attribution Error a Universal Phenomenon?
You may be able to think of examples of the fundamental attribution error in your life. Do people in all cultures
commit the fundamental attribution error? Research suggests that they do not. People from an individualistic
culture, that is, a culture that focuses on individual achievement and autonomy, have the greatest tendency to
commit the fundamental attribution error. Individualistic cultures, which tend to be found in western
countries such as the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, promote a focus on the individual.
Therefore, a person’s disposition is thought to be the primary explanation for her behavior. In contrast, people
from a collectivistic culture, that is, a culture that focuses on communal relationships with others, such as
family, friends, and community (Figure 12.4), are less likely to commit the fundamental attribution error
(Markus & Kitayama, 1991; Triandis, 2001).
FIGURE 12.4 People from collectivistic cultures, such as some Asian cultures, are more likely to emphasize
relationships with others than to focus primarily on the individual. Activities such as (a) preparing a meal, (b)
hanging out, and (c) playing a game engage people in a group. (credit a: modification of work by Arian Zwegers;
credit b: modification of work by ""conbon33""/Flickr; credit c: modification of work by Anja Disseldorp)
Why do you think this is the case? Collectivistic cultures, which tend to be found in east Asian countries and in
Latin American and African countries, focus on the group more than on the individual (Nisbett, Peng, Choi, &

While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember what he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is associated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend’s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John Nash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would tell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended for him. He also began to hear voices in his head that he could not control. When he tried to stop them, they would come back to him, and when he did not want them to, the voices would leave him (Wearing, n.d.). These are just a few of the many examples of how people experience the world around them in ways that are unpredictable and difficult to understand. In this chapter, we will explore what psychology is, what it is not, and how it has evolved over time. We will also look at some common misconceptions about psychology. Finally, we will discuss some careers in psychology and the role that psychology plays in our lives. 2. WHAT IS PSYCHOLOGY? The word “psychology” comes from two Greek words, “psyche” and “logos,” which mean “mind” or “thinking.” Psychologists are interested in how the mind works and how we think and feel. They study the mental processes that occur in the brain, such as perception, attention, memory, thinking, problem solving, emotion, motivation, learning, decision making, self-regulation, personality, social behavior, etc. Psychologists use a variety of methods to study these processes, including observation, experiments, surveys, interviews, questionnaires, brain imaging, neuropsychology, cognitive neuroscience, psychometrics, clinical psychology, developmental psychology, ethnopsychology and social psychology. Psychology has a long and rich history. It has been practiced for thousands of years in many different cultures and societies. For example, in ancient Greece, Plato and Aristotle studied psychology in order to understand the nature of human beings and their relationships with each other and with their environment. In the Middle Ages, Christian theologians and philosophers used psychology as a tool for understanding the nature of God and his relationship with his creatures. During the Renaissance, scientists and thinkers such as Galileo Galilei, Isaac Newton, René Descartes, John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Auguste Comte, Jean-Paul Sartre, Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, William James, Edward Thorndike, B.F.

Welcome to the story of your life. In this chapter we explore the fascinating tale of how you
have grown and developed into the person you are today. We also look at some ideas about who you will grow
into tomorrow. Yours is a story of lifespan development (Figure 9.1), from the start of life to the end.
The process of human growth and development is more obvious in infancy and childhood, yet your
development is happening this moment and will continue, minute by minute, for the rest of your life. Who you
are today and who you will be in the future depends on a blend of genetics, environment, culture,
relationships, and more, as you continue through each phase of life. You have experienced firsthand much of
what is discussed in this chapter. Now consider what psychological science has to say about your physical,
cognitive, and psychosocial development, from the womb to the tomb.

9.1 What Is Lifespan Development?
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Define and distinguish between the three domains of development: physical, cognitive and psychosocial
• Discuss the normative approach to development
• Understand the three major issues in development: continuity and discontinuity, one common course of
development or many unique courses of development, and nature versus nurture
My heart leaps up when I behold
A rainbow in the sky:
So was it when my life began;
So is it now I am a man;
So be it when I shall grow old,
Or let me die!
The Child is father of the Man;
I could wish my days to be
Bound each to each by natural piety. (Wordsworth, 1802)
In this poem, William Wordsworth writes, “the child is father of the man.” What does this seemingly
incongruous statement mean, and what does it have to do with lifespan development? Wordsworth might be
suggesting that the person he is as an adult depends largely on the experiences he had in childhood. Consider
the following questions: To what extent is the adult you are today influenced by the child you once were? To
what extent is a child fundamentally different from the adult he grows up to be?
These are the types of questions developmental psychologists try to answer, by studying how humans change
and grow from conception through childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and death. They view development as a
lifelong process that can be studied scientifically across three developmental domains—physical, cognitive,
and psychosocial development. Physical development involves growth and changes in the body and brain, the
senses, motor skills, and health and wellness. Cognitive development involves learning, attention, memory,
language, thinking, reasoning, and creativity. Psychosocial development involves emotions, personality, and
social relationships. We refer to these domains throughout the chapter.
Research Methods in Developmental Psychology
You’ve learned about a variety of research methods used by psychologists. Developmental psychologists use many
of these approaches in order to better understand how individuals change mentally and physically over time. These
methods include naturalistic observations, case studies, surveys, and experiments, among others.
Naturalistic observations involve observing behavior in its natural context. A developmental psychologist might
observe how children behave on a playground, at a daycare center, or in the child’s own home. While this research
approach provides a glimpse into how children behave in their natural settings, researchers have very little control
over the types and/or frequencies of displayed behavior.
In a case study, developmental psychologists collect a great deal of information from one individual in order to
better understand physical and psychological changes over the lifespan. This particular approach is an excellent way
to better understand individuals, who are exceptional in some way, but it is especially prone to researcher bias in
interpretation, and it is difficult to generalize conclusions to the larger population.
In one classic example of this research method being applied to a study of lifespan development Sigmund Freud
analyzed the development of a child known as “Little Hans” (Freud, 1909/1949). Freud’s findings helped inform his
theories of psychosexual development in children, which you will learn about later in this chapter. Little Genie, the

subject of a case study discussed in the chapter on thinking and intelligence, provides another example of how
psychologists examine developmental milestones through detailed research on a single individual. In Genie’s case,
her neglectful and abusive upbringing led to her being unable to speak until, at age 13, she was removed from that
harmful environment. As she learned to use language, psychologists were able to compare how her language
acquisition abilities differed when occurring in her late-stage development compared to the typical acquisition of
those skills during the ages of infancy through early childhood (Fromkin, Krashen, Curtiss, Rigler, & Rigler, 1974;
Curtiss, 1981).
The survey method asks individuals to self-report important information about their thoughts, experiences, and
beliefs. This particular method can provide large amounts of information in relatively short amounts of time;
however, validity of data collected in this way relies on honest self-reporting, and the data is relatively shallow when
compared to the depth of information collected in a case study. An example of comprehensive survey was the
research done by Ruth W. Howard. In 1934, she obtained her doctorate by surveying 229 sets of triplets, the most
comprehensive research of triplets completed at the time. This pioneering woman was also the first African-
American woman to earn a PhD in psychology (American Psychological Association, 2019).
Experiments involve significant control over extraneous variables and manipulation of the independent variable. As
such, experimental research allows developmental psychologists to make causal statements about certain variables
that are important for the developmental process. Because experimental research must occur in a controlled
environment, researchers must be cautious about whether behaviors observed in the laboratory translate to an
individual’s natural environment.
Later in this chapter, you will learn about several experiments in which toddlers and young children observe scenes
or actions so that researchers can determine at what age specific cognitive abilities develop. For example, children
may observe a quantity of liquid poured from a short, fat glass into a tall, skinny glass. As the experimenters
question the children about what occurred, the subjects’ answers help psychologists understand at what age a child
begins to comprehend that the volume of liquid remained the same although the shapes of the containers differs.
Across these three domains—physical, cognitive, and psychosocial—the normative approach to development
is also discussed. This approach asks, “What is normal development?” In the early decades of the 20th century,
normative psychologists studied large numbers of children at various ages to determine norms (i.e., average
ages) of when most children reach specific developmental milestones in each of the three domains (Gesell,
1933, 1939, 1940; Gesell & Ilg, 1946; Hall, 1904). Although children develop at slightly different rates, we can
use these age-related averages as general guidelines to compare children with same-age peers to determine
the approximate ages they should reach specific normative events called developmental milestones (e.g.,
crawling, walking, writing, dressing, naming colors, speaking in sentences, and starting puberty).
Not all normative events are universal, meaning they are not experienced by all individuals across all cultures.
Biological milestones, such as puberty, tend to be universal, but social milestones, such as the age when
children begin formal schooling, are not necessarily universal; instead, they affect most individuals in a
particular culture (Gesell & Ilg, 1946). For example, in developed countries children begin school around 5 or 6
years old, but in developing countries, like Nigeria, children often enter school at an advanced age, if at all
(Huebler, 2005; United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization [UNESCO], 2013).
To better understand the normative approach, imagine two new mothers, Louisa and Kimberly, who are close
friends and have children around the same age. Louisa’s daughter is 14 months old, and Kimberly’s son is 12
months old. According to the normative approach, the average age a child starts to walk is 12 months.
However, at 14 months Louisa’s daughter still isn’t walking. She tells Kimberly she is worried that something
might be wrong with her baby. Kimberly is surprised because her son started walking when he was only 10
months old. Should Louisa be worried? Should she be concerned if her daughter is not walking by 15 months
or 18 months?

Issues in Developmental Psychology
There are many different theoretical approaches regarding human development. As we evaluate them in this
chapter, recall that developmental psychology focuses on how people change, and keep in mind that all the
approaches that we present in this chapter address questions of change: Is the change smooth or uneven
(continuous versus discontinuous)? Is this pattern of change the same for everyone, or are there many
different patterns of change (one course of development versus many courses)? How do genetics and
environment interact to influence development (nature versus nurture)?
Is Development Continuous or Discontinuous?
Continuous development views development as a cumulative process, gradually improving on existing skills
(Figure 9.2). With this type of development, there is gradual change. Consider, for example, a child’s physical
growth: adding inches to height year by year. In contrast, theorists who view development as discontinuous
believe that development takes place in unique stages: It occurs at specific times or ages. With this type of
development, the change is more sudden, such as an infant’s ability to conceive object permanence.
FIGURE 9.2 The concept of continuous development can be visualized as a smooth slope of progression, whereas
discontinuous development sees growth in more discrete stages.
Is There One Course of Development or Many?
Is development essentially the same, or universal, for all children (i.e., there is one course of development) or
does development follow a different course for each child, depending on the child’s specific genetics and
environment (i.e., there are many courses of development)? Do people across the world share more similarities
or more differences in their development? How much do culture and genetics influence a child’s behavior?
Stage theories hold that the sequence of development is universal. For example, in cross-cultural studies of
language development, children from around the world reach language milestones in a similar sequence
(Gleitman & Newport, 1995). Infants in all cultures coo before they babble. They begin babbling at about the
same age and utter their first word around 12 months old. Yet we live in diverse contexts that have a unique
effect on each of us. For example, researchers once believed that motor development follows one course for all
children regardless of culture. However, child care practices vary by culture, and different practices have been
found to accelerate or inhibit achievement of developmental milestones such as sitting, crawling, and walking
(Karasik, Adolph, Tamis-LeMonda, & Bornstein, 2010).
For instance, let’s look at the Aché society in Paraguay. They spend a significant amount of time foraging in
282 9 • Lifespan Development
Access for free at openstax.org
forests. While foraging, Aché mothers carry their young children, rarely putting them down in order to protect
them from getting hurt in the forest. Consequently, their children walk much later: They walk around 23–25
months old, in comparison to infants in Western cultures who begin to walk around 12 months old. However,
as Aché children become older, they are allowed more freedom to move about, and by about age 9, their motor
skills surpass those of U.S. children of the same age: Aché children are able to climb trees up to 25 feet tall and
use machetes to chop their way through the forest (Kaplan & Dove, 1987). As you can see, our development is
influenced by multiple contexts, so the timing of basic motor functions may vary across cultures. However, the
functions themselves are present in all societies (Figure 9.3).

How Do Nature and Nurture Influence Development?
Are we who we are because of nature (biology and genetics), or are we who we are because of nurture (our
environment and culture)? This longstanding question is known in psychology as the nature versus nurture
debate. It seeks to understand how our personalities and traits are the product of our genetic makeup and
biological factors, and how they are shaped by our environment, including our guardians, peers, and culture.
For instance, why do biological children sometimes act like their parents—is it because of genetics or because
of early childhood environment and what the child has learned from the parents? What about children who are
adopted—are they more like their biological families or more like their adoptive families? And how can siblings
from the same family be so different?
We are all born with specific genetic traits inherited from our parents, such as eye color, height, and certain
personality traits. Beyond our basic genotype, however, there is a deep interaction between our genes and our
environment: Our unique experiences in our environment influence whether and how particular traits are
expressed, and at the same time, our genes influence how we interact with our environment (Diamond, 2009;
Lobo, 2008). This chapter will show that there is a reciprocal interaction between nature and nurture as they
both shape who we become, but the debate continues as to the relative contributions of each.
The Achievement Gap: How Does Socioeconomic Status Affect Development?
The achievement gap refers to the persistent difference in grades, test scores, and graduation rates that exist
among students of different ethnicities, races, and—in certain subjects—genders (Winerman, 2011). Research
suggests that these achievement gaps are strongly influenced by differences in socioeconomic factors that exist
among the families of these children. While the researchers acknowledge that programs aimed at reducing such
socioeconomic discrepancies would likely aid in equalizing the aptitude and performance of children from
different backgrounds, they recognize that such large-scale interventions would be difficult to achieve. Therefore,
it is recommended that programs aimed at fostering aptitude and achievement among disadvantaged children
may be the best option for dealing with issues related to academic achievement gaps (Duncan & Magnuson,
DIG DEEPER
9.1 • What Is Lifespan Development? 283
2005).
Children from low-income households perform significantly more poorly than their middle- and high-income
peers on a number of educational variables: They have significantly lower standardized test scores, graduation
rates, and college entrance rates, and they have much higher school dropout rates. There have been attempts to
correct the achievement gap through state and federal legislation, but what if the problems start before the
children even enter school?
Psychologists Betty Hart and Todd Risley (2006) spent their careers looking at early language ability and
progression of children in various income levels. In one longitudinal study, they found that although all the
parents in the study engaged and interacted with their children, middle- and high-income parents interacted with
their children differently than low-income parents. After analyzing 1,300 hours of parent-child interactions, the
researchers found that middle- and high-income parents talk to their children significantly more, starting when
the children are infants. By 3 years old, high-income children knew almost double the number of words known by
their low-income counterparts, and they had heard an estimated total of 30 million more words than the low-
income counterparts (Hart & Risley, 2003). And the gaps only become more pronounced. Before entering
kindergarten, high-income children score 60% higher on achievement tests than their low-income peers (Lee &
Burkam, 2002).
There are solutions to this problem. At the University of Chicago, experts are working with low-income families,
visiting them at their homes, and encouraging them to speak more to their children on a daily and hourly basis.
Other experts are designing preschools in which students from diverse economic backgrounds are placed in the
same classroom. In this research, low-income children made significant gains in their language development,
likely as a result of attending the specialized preschool (Schechter & Byeb, 2007). What other methods or
interventions could be used to decrease the achievement gap? What types of activities could be implemented to
help the children of your community or a neighboring community?
9.2 Lifespan Theories
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Discuss Freud’s theory of psychosexual development
• Describe the major tasks of child and adult psychosocial development according to Erikson
• Discuss Piaget’s view of cognitive development and apply the stages to understanding childhood cognition
• Describe Kohlberg’s theory of moral development
• Compare and contrast the strengths and weaknesses of major developmental theories
There are many theories regarding how babies and children grow and develop into happy, healthy adults. We
explore several of these theories in this section.
Psychosexual Theory of Development
Sigmund Freud (1856–1939) believed that personality develops during early childhood. For Freud, childhood
experiences shape our personalities and behavior as adults. Freud viewed development as discontinuous; he
believed that each of us must pass through a series of stages during childhood, and that if we lack proper
nurturance and parenting during a stage, we may become stuck, or fixated, in that stage. Freud’s stages are
called the stages of psychosexual development. According to Freud, children’s pleasure-seeking urges are
focused on a different area of the body, called an erogenous zone, at each of the five stages of development:
oral, anal, phallic, latency, and genital.
While most of Freud’s ideas have not found support in modern research, we cannot discount the contributions
that Freud has made to the field of psychology. Psychologists today dispute Freud's psychosexual stages as a
legitimate explanation for how one's personality develops, but what we can take away from Freud’s theory is

The Child is father of the Man; I could not live without him; He is the child of my heart, And I love him with all my being. —William Blake, The Marriage of Heaven and Hell (1794) LIFE SPAN DEVELOPMENT The term “development” is used to describe the changes that occur in an organism as it grows and develops from birth to death. Development is an ongoing process that occurs throughout the life of an organism. It includes changes in structure, function, physiology, behavior, cognition, emotions, personality, and more. The term lifespan refers to a person’s life span, or the total number of years he or she will live. Lifespans vary widely from person to person, but the average lifespan of a human being is about 75 years. Most people live longer than this, with some living into their eighties and nineties. However, most people live only a few years beyond the age of 65. For example, a 55-year-old person is likely to live for about 30 more years, while someone who is 40 years old is expected to have a life expectancy of only about 28 years. This means that most people will die before they reach the peak of their physical and mental capacities. Thus, it is important to understand how the human body and mind develop and change throughout your life. There are many different theories about how humans develop. These theories can be divided into two main categories: biological and psychological. Biological theories focus on the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to human development. Psychological theories, in contrast, emphasize the role of the individual in shaping his or her own development and the influence of culture and society on human development. Biological and Psychological Approaches to Developmental Theory There is no single theory of developmental theory that is universally accepted. Instead, there are a variety of theories that have been developed over time, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some theories are based on observations of natural phenomena, such as the growth of plants and animals. Others focus on individual differences in behavior and personality. Still others are concerned with the interplay between genetics and environment. Each of these theories attempts to explain how development occurs and how it differs from one individual to another. In the following sections, we will discuss three different theoretical approaches to developmental theory: the biological approach, the social-cognitive approach (also called the psychological approach), and the developmental","{""sections"": [""Lifespan Development/Stages of Development""], ""pages"": [""292"", ""293"", ""294""]}"

1.4 Careers in Psychology
Clive Wearing is an accomplished musician who lost his ability to form new memories when
he became sick at the age of 46. While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember
what he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is
associated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend’s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John
Nash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would
tell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended
for him. He also began to hear voices and became suspicious of the people around him. Soon thereafter, Nash
was diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a state-run mental institution (O’Connor & Robertson,
1Introduction to Psychology
2002). Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these
experiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain’s internal
processes and people’s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of
psychology has explored these questions.
1.1 What Is Psychology?
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Define psychology
• Understand the merits of an education in psychology
What is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology
explores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists
use the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question
about how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the
phenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or
group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over
time. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes
observations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then
published or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.
Scientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because
it is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We
must ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However,
we can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus,
psychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.
In general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot
arrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the
mind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific
method is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on
observation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or
previous authorities.
It was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this
time, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is,
at its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological
organism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore,
psychology is also a social science.
WHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?
Often, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to
learn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course
because it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as
nursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare
psychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses
across the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology
majors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook’s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality
and political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About
6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S.
Department of Education, 2016).

An education in psychology is valuable for a number of reasons. Psychology students hone critical thinking
skills and are trained in the use of the scientific method. Critical thinking is the active application of a set of
skills to information for the understanding and evaluation of that information. The evaluation of
information—assessing its reliability and usefulness— is an important skill in a world full of competing “facts,”
many of which are designed to be misleading. For example, critical thinking involves maintaining an attitude
of skepticism, recognizing internal biases, making use of logical thinking, asking appropriate questions, and
making observations. Psychology students also can develop better communication skills during the course of
their undergraduate coursework (American Psychological Association, 2011). Together, these factors increase
students’ scientific literacy and prepare students to critically evaluate the various sources of information they
encounter.
In addition to these broad-based skills, psychology students come to understand the complex factors that
shape one’s behavior. They appreciate the interaction of our biology, our environment, and our experiences in
determining who we are and how we will behave. They learn about basic principles that guide how we think
and behave, and they come to recognize the tremendous diversity that exists across individuals and across
cultural boundaries (American Psychological Association, 2011).

1.2 History of Psychology
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Understand the importance of Wundt and James in the development of psychology
• Appreciate Freud’s influence on psychology
• Understand the basic tenets of Gestalt psychology
• Appreciate the important role that behaviorism played in psychology’s history
• Understand basic tenets of humanism
• Understand how the cognitive revolution shifted psychology’s focus back to the mind
Psychology is a relatively young science with its experimental roots in the 19th century, compared, for
example, to human physiology, which dates much earlier. As mentioned, anyone interested in exploring issues
related to the mind generally did so in a philosophical context prior to the 19th century. Two 19th century
scholars, Wilhelm Wundt and William James, are generally credited as being the founders of psychology as a
science and academic discipline that was distinct from philosophy. This section will provide an overview of the
shifts in paradigms that have influenced psychology from Wundt and James through today.
Wundt and Structuralism
Wilhelm Wundt (1832–1920) was a German scientist who was the first person to be referred to as a
psychologist. His famous book entitled Principles of Physiological Psychology was published in 1873. Wundt
viewed psychology as a scientific study of conscious experience, and he believed that the goal of psychology
was to identify components of consciousness and how those components combined to result in our conscious
experience. Wundt used introspection (he called it “internal perception”), a process by which someone
examines their own conscious experience as objectively as possible, making the human mind like any other
aspect of nature that a scientist observed. He believed in the notion of voluntarism—that people have free will
and should know the intentions of a psychological experiment if they were participating (Danziger, 1980).
Wundt considered his version experimental introspection; he used instruments such as those that measured
reaction time. He also wrote Volkerpsychologie in 1904 in which he suggested that psychology should include
the study of culture, as it involves the study of people. Edward Titchener, one of his students, went on to
1.2 • History of Psychology 9
develop structuralism. Its focus was on the contents of mental processes rather than their function (Pickren &
Rutherford, 2010). Wundt established his psychology laboratory at the University at Leipzig in 1879 (Figure
1.2). In this laboratory, Wundt and his students conducted experiments on, for example, reaction times. A
subject, sometimes in a room isolated from the scientist, would receive a stimulus such as a light, image, or
sound. The subject’s reaction to the stimulus would be to push a button, and an apparatus would record the
time to reaction. Wundt could measure reaction time to one-thousandth of a second (Nicolas & Ferrand, 1999).
FIGURE 1.2 (a) Wilhelm Wundt is credited as one of the founders of psychology. He created the first laboratory for
psychological research. (b) This photo shows him seated and surrounded by fellow researchers and equipment in
his laboratory in Germany.
However, despite his efforts to train individuals in the process of introspection, this process remained highly
subjective, and there was very little agreement between individuals.
Functionalism
William James, John Dewey, and Charles Sanders Peirce helped establish functional psychology (Figure 1.3).
They accepted Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection and viewed this theory as an explanation of an
organism’s characteristics. Key to that theory is the idea that natural selection leads to organisms that are
adapted to their environment, including their behavior. Adaptation means that a trait of an organism has a
function for the survival and reproduction of the individual, because it has been naturally selected. As James
saw it, psychology’s purpose was to study the function of behavior in the world, and as such, his perspective
was known as functionalism. Functionalism focused on how mental activities helped an organism fit into its
environment. Functionalism has a second, more subtle meaning in that functionalists were more interested in
the operation of the whole mind rather than of its individual parts, which were the focus of structuralism. Like
Wundt, James believed that introspection could serve as one means by which someone might study mental
activities, but James also relied on more objective measures, including the use of various recording devices,
and examinations of concrete products of mental activities and of anatomy and physiology (Gordon, 1995).

developed and worked. Until the 1960s, the science of psychology was largely a “womanless” psychology
(Crawford & Marecek, 1989), meaning that few women were able to practice psychology, so they had little
influence on what was studied. In addition, the experimental subjects of psychology were mostly men, which
resulted from underlying assumptions that gender had no influence on psychology and that women were not of
sufficient interest to study.
An article by Naomi Weisstein, first published in 1968 (Weisstein, 1993), stimulated a feminist revolution in
psychology by presenting a critique of psychology as a science. She also specifically criticized male psychologists
for constructing the psychology of women entirely out of their own cultural biases and without careful
experimental tests to verify any of their characterizations of women. Weisstein used, as examples, statements by
prominent psychologists in the 1960s, such as this quote by Bruno Bettleheim: “We must start with the
realization that, as much as women want to be good scientists or engineers, they want first and foremost to be
womanly companions of men and to be mothers.” Weisstein’s critique formed the foundation for the subsequent
development of a feminist psychology that attempted to be free of the influence of male cultural biases on our
knowledge of the psychology of women.
Crawford & Marecek (1989) identify several feminist approaches to psychology that can be described as feminist
psychology. These include re-evaluating and discovering the contributions of women to the history of psychology,
studying psychological gender differences, and questioning the male bias present across the practice of the
scientific approach to knowledge.
Multicultural And Cross-Cultural Psychology
Culture impacts individuals, groups, and society. An ongoing issue researchers are trying to correct is that
certain populations have been over-studied and the results of these studies have been applied to other
populations. For example, Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan discuss how WEIRD societies have been
overstudied and the results have been wrongly applied to non-WEIRD societies (2010). WEIRD stands for
western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic. Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan found that there are
many differences between people in the WEIRD group and people in less industrialized, less urban, and non-
Western societies. These differences occur in a variety of areas, including perception, cooperation, and moral
reasoning. That is, people vary depending on their culture and environment. Multicultural psychologists
develop theories and conduct research with diverse populations, typically within one country. Cross-cultural
psychologists compare populations across countries, such as participants from the United States compared to
participants from China.
In 1920, Francis Cecil Sumner was the first African American to receive a PhD in psychology in the United
States. Sumner established a psychology degree program at Howard University, leading to the education of a
new generation of African American psychologists (Black, Spence, and Omari, 2004). Much of the work of early
psychologists from diverse backgrounds was dedicated to challenging intelligence testing and promoting
innovative educational methods for children. George I. Sanchez contested such testing with Mexican American
children. As a psychologist of Mexican heritage, he pointed out that the language and cultural barriers in
testing were keeping children from equal opportunities (Guthrie, 1998). By 1940, he was teaching with his
doctoral degree at University of Texas at Austin and challenging segregated educational practices (Romo,
1986).
Two famous African American researchers and psychologists are Mamie Phipps Clark and her husband,
Kenneth Clark. They are best known for their studies conducted on African American children and doll
preference, research that was instrumental in the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court desegregation
case. The Clarks applied their research to social services and opened the first child guidance center in Harlem
(American Psychological Association, 2019).

The American Psychological Association has several ethnically based organizations for professional
psychologists that facilitate interactions among members. Since psychologists belonging to specific ethnic
groups or cultures have the most interest in studying the psychology of their communities, these organizations
provide an opportunity for the growth of research on the interplay between culture and psychology.
WOMEN IN PSYCHOLOGY
Although rarely given credit, women have been contributing to psychology since its inception as a field of
study. In 1894, Margaret Floy Washburn was the first woman awarded the doctoral degree in psychology. She
wrote The Animal Mind: A Textbook of Comparative Psychology, and it was the standard in the field for over 20
years. In the mid 1890s, Mary Whiton Calkins completed all requirements toward the PhD in psychology, but
Harvard University refused to award her that degree because she was a woman. She had been taught and
mentored by William James, who tried and failed to convince Harvard to award her the doctoral degree. Her
memory research studied primacy and recency (Madigan & O’Hara, 1992), and she also wrote about how
structuralism and functionalism both explained self-psychology (Calkins, 1906).
Another influential woman, Mary Cover Jones, conducted a study she considered to be a sequel to John B.
Watson’s study of Little Albert (you’ll learn about this study in the chapter on Learning). Jones unconditioned
fear in Little Peter, who had been afraid of rabbits (Jones, 1924).
Ethnic minority women contributing to the field of psychology include Martha Bernal and Inez Beverly Prosser;
their studies were related to education. Bernal, the first Latina to earn her doctoral degree in psychology
(1962) conducted much of her research with Mexican American children. Prosser was the first African
American woman awarded the PhD in 1933 at the University of Cincinnati (Benjamin, Henry, & McMahon,

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Appreciate the diversity of interests and foci within psychology
• Understand basic interests and applications in each of the described areas of psychology
• Demonstrate familiarity with some of the major concepts or important figures in each of the described areas of
psychology
Contemporary psychology is a diverse field that is influenced by all of the historical perspectives described in
the preceding section. Reflective of the discipline’s diversity is the diversity seen within the American
Psychological Association (APA). The APA is a professional organization representing psychologists in the
United States. The APA is the largest organization of psychologists in the world, and its mission is to advance
and disseminate psychological knowledge for the betterment of people. There are 54 divisions within the APA,
representing a wide variety of specialties that range from Societies for the Psychology of Religion and
Spirituality to Exercise and Sport Psychology to Behavioral Neuroscience and Comparative Psychology.
Reflecting the diversity of the field of psychology itself, members, affiliate members, and associate members
span the spectrum from students to doctoral-level psychologists, and come from a variety of places including
educational settings, criminal justice, hospitals, the armed forces, and industry (American Psychological
Association, 2014). G. Stanley Hall was the first president of the APA. Before he earned his doctoral degree, he
was an adjunct instructor at Wilberforce University, a historically Black college/university (HBCU), while
serving as faculty at Antioch College. Hall went on to work under William James, earning his PhD. Eventually,
18 1 • Introduction to Psychology

he became the first president of Clark University in Massachusetts when it was founded (Pickren & Rutherford,
2010).
The Association for Psychological Science (APS) was founded in 1988 and seeks to advance the scientific
orientation of psychology. Its founding resulted from disagreements between members of the scientific and
clinical branches of psychology within the APA. The APS publishes five research journals and engages in
education and advocacy with funding agencies. A significant proportion of its members are international,
although the majority is located in the United States. Other organizations provide networking and
collaboration opportunities for professionals of several ethnic or racial groups working in psychology, such as
the National Latina/o Psychological Association (NLPA), the Asian American Psychological Association (AAPA),
the Association of Black Psychologists (ABPsi), and the Society of Indian Psychologists (SIP). Most of these
groups are also dedicated to studying psychological and social issues within their specific communities.
This section will provide an overview of the major subdivisions within psychology today in the order in which
they are introduced throughout the remainder of this textbook. This is not meant to be an exhaustive listing,
but it will provide insight into the major areas of research and practice of modern-day psychologists.

Biopsychology and Evolutionary Psychology
As the name suggests, biopsychology explores how our biology influences our behavior. While biological
psychology is a broad field, many biological psychologists want to understand how the structure and function
of the nervous system is related to behavior (Figure 1.10). As such, they often combine the research strategies
of both psychologists and physiologists to accomplish this goal (as discussed in Carlson, 2013).
FIGURE 1.10 Biological psychologists study how the structure and function of the nervous system generate
behavior.
The research interests of biological psychologists span a number of domains, including but not limited to,
1.3 • Contemporary Psychology 19
sensory and motor systems, sleep, drug use and abuse, ingestive behavior, reproductive behavior,
neurodevelopment, plasticity of the nervous system, and biological correlates of psychological disorders.
Given the broad areas of interest falling under the purview of biological psychology, it will probably come as no
surprise that individuals from all sorts of backgrounds are involved in this research, including biologists,
medical professionals, physiologists, and chemists. This interdisciplinary approach is often referred to as
neuroscience, of which biological psychology is a component (Carlson, 2013).
While biopsychology typically focuses on the immediate causes of behavior based in the physiology of a
human or other animal, evolutionary psychology seeks to study the ultimate biological causes of behavior. To
the extent that a behavior is impacted by genetics, a behavior, like any anatomical characteristic of a human or
animal, will demonstrate adaption to its surroundings. These surroundings include the physical environment
and, since interactions between organisms can be important to survival and reproduction, the social
environment. The study of behavior in the context of evolution has its origins with Charles Darwin, the co-
discoverer of the theory of evolution by natural selection. Darwin was well aware that behaviors should be
adaptive and wrote books titled, The Descent of Man (1871) and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and
Animals (1872), to explore this field.
Evolutionary psychology, and specifically, the evolutionary psychology of humans, has enjoyed a resurgence in
recent decades. To be subject to evolution by natural selection, a behavior must have a significant genetic
cause. In general, we expect all human cultures to express a behavior if it is caused genetically, since the
genetic differences among human groups are small. The approach taken by most evolutionary psychologists is
to predict the outcome of a behavior in a particular situation based on evolutionary theory and then to make
observations, or conduct experiments, to determine whether the results match the theory. It is important to
recognize that these types of studies are not strong evidence that a behavior is adaptive, since they lack
information that the behavior is in some part genetic and not entirely cultural (Endler, 1986). Demonstrating
that a trait, especially in humans, is naturally selected is extraordinarily difficult; perhaps for this reason,
some evolutionary psychologists are content to assume the behaviors they study have genetic determinants
(Confer et al., 2010).
One other drawback of evolutionary psychology is that the traits that we possess now evolved under
environmental and social conditions far back in human history, and we have a poor understanding of what
these conditions were. This makes predictions about what is adaptive for a behavior difficult. Behavioral traits
need not be adaptive under current conditions, only under the conditions of the past when they evolved, about
which we can only hypothesize.
There are many areas of human behavior for which evolution can make predictions. Examples include
memory, mate choice, relationships between kin, friendship and cooperation, parenting, social organization,
and status (Confer et al., 2010).
Evolutionary psychologists have had success in finding experimental correspondence between observations
and expectations. In one example, in a study of mate preference differences between men and women that
spanned 37 cultures, Buss (1989) found that women valued earning potential factors greater than men, and
men valued potential reproductive factors (youth and attractiveness) greater than women in their prospective
mates. In general, the predictions were in line with the predictions of evolution, although there were deviations
in some cultures.
Sensation and Perception
Scientists interested in both physiological aspects of sensory systems as well as in the psychological
experience of sensory information work within the area of sensation and perception (Figure 1.11). As such,
sensation and perception research is also quite interdisciplinary. Imagine walking between buildings as you
move from one class to another. You are inundated with sights, sounds, touch sensations, and smells. You also
experience the temperature of the air around you and maintain your balance as you make your way. These are
20 1 • Introduction to Psychology
Access for free at openstax.org
all factors of interest to someone working in the domain of sensation and perception.
FIGURE 1.11 When you look at this image, you may see a duck or a rabbit. The sensory information remains the
same, but your perception can vary dramatically.
As described in a later chapter that focuses on the results of studies in sensation and perception, our
experience of our world is not as simple as the sum total of all of the sensory information (or sensations)
together. Rather, our experience (or perception) is complex and is influenced by where we focus our attention,
our previous experiences, and even our cultural backgrounds.
Cognitive Psychology
As mentioned in the previous section, the cognitive revolution created an impetus for psychologists to focus
their attention on better understanding the mind and mental processes that underlie behavior. Thus, cognitive
psychology is the area of psychology that focuses on studying cognitions, or thoughts, and their relationship to
our experiences and our actions. Like biological psychology, cognitive psychology is broad in its scope and
often involves collaborations among people from a diverse range of disciplinary backgrounds. This has led
some to coin the term cognitive science to describe the interdisciplinary nature of this area of research (Miller,
2003).
Cognitive psychologists have research interests that span a spectrum of topics, ranging from attention to
problem solving to language to memory. The approaches used in studying these topics are equally diverse.
Given such diversity, cognitive psychology is not captured in one chapter of this text per se; rather, various
concepts related to cognitive psychology will be covered in relevant portions of the chapters in this text on
sensation and perception, thinking and intelligence, memory, lifespan development, social psychology, and
therapy.
Developmental Psychology
Developmental psychology is the scientific study of development across a lifespan. Developmental
psychologists are interested in processes related to physical maturation. However, their focus is not limited to
the physical changes associated with aging, as they also focus on changes in cognitive skills, moral reasoning,
social behavior, and other psychological attributes.
Early developmental psychologists focused primarily on changes that occurred through reaching adulthood,
providing enormous insight into the differences in physical, cognitive, and social capacities that exist between
very young children and adults. For instance, research by Jean Piaget (Figure 1.12) demonstrated that very
young children do not demonstrate object permanence. Object permanence refers to the understanding that
physical things continue to exist, even if they are hidden from us. If you were to show an adult a toy, and then
hide it behind a curtain, the adult knows that the toy still exists. However, very young infants act as if a hidden
object no longer exists. The age at which object permanence is achieved is somewhat controversial (Munakata,
McClelland, Johnson, and Siegler, 1997).

FIGURE 1.13 Each of the dimensions of the Five Factor model is shown in this figure. The provided description
would describe someone who scored highly on that given dimension. Someone with a lower score on a given
dimension could be described in opposite terms.
Social Psychology
Social psychology focuses on how we interact with and relate to others. Social psychologists conduct research
on a wide variety of topics that include differences in how we explain our own behavior versus how we explain
the behaviors of others, prejudice, and attraction, and how we resolve interpersonal conflicts. Social
psychologists have also sought to determine how being among other people changes our own behavior and
patterns of thinking.
There are many interesting examples of social psychological research, and you will read about many of these
in a later chapter of this textbook. Until then, you will be introduced to one of the most controversial
psychological studies ever conducted. Stanley Milgram was an American social psychologist who is most
famous for research that he conducted on obedience. After the holocaust, in 1961, a Nazi war criminal, Adolf
Eichmann, who was accused of committing mass atrocities, was put on trial. Many people wondered how
German soldiers were capable of torturing prisoners in concentration camps, and they were unsatisfied with
the excuses given by soldiers that they were simply following orders. At the time, most psychologists agreed
that few people would be willing to inflict such extraordinary pain and suffering, simply because they were
obeying orders. Milgram decided to conduct research to determine whether or not this was true (Figure 1.14).
As you will read later in the text, Milgram found that nearly two-thirds of his participants were willing to
deliver what they believed to be lethal shocks to another person, simply because they were instructed to do so
by an authority figure (in this case, a man dressed in a lab coat). This was in spite of the fact that participants
1.3 • Contemporary Psychology 23
received payment for simply showing up for the research study and could have chosen not to inflict pain or
more serious consequences on another person by withdrawing from the study. No one was actually hurt or
harmed in any way, Milgram’s experiment was a clever ruse that took advantage of research confederates,
those who pretend to be participants in a research study who are actually working for the researcher and have
clear, specific directions on how to behave during the research study (Hock, 2009). Milgram’s and others’
studies that involved deception and potential emotional harm to study participants catalyzed the development
of ethical guidelines for conducting psychological research that discourage the use of deception of research
subjects, unless it can be argued not to cause harm and, in general, requiring informed consent of
participants.
FIGURE 1.14 Stanley Milgram’s research demonstrated just how far people will go in obeying orders from an
authority figure. This advertisement was used to recruit subjects for his research.
Industrial-Organizational Psychology
Industrial-Organizational psychology (I-O psychology) is a subfield of psychology that applies psychological
theories, principles, and research findings in industrial and organizational settings. I-O psychologists are often
involved in issues related to personnel management, organizational structure, and workplace environment.
Businesses often seek the aid of I-O psychologists to make the best hiring decisions as well as to create an
environment that results in high levels of employee productivity and efficiency. In addition to its applied
nature, I-O psychology also involves conducting scientific research on behavior within I-O settings (Riggio,
2013).

Health Psychology
Health psychology focuses on how health is affected by the interaction of biological, psychological, and
sociocultural factors. This particular approach is known as the biopsychosocial model (Figure 1.15). Health
psychologists are interested in helping individuals achieve better health through public policy, education,
intervention, and research. Health psychologists might conduct research that explores the relationship
between one’s genetic makeup, patterns of behavior, relationships, psychological stress, and health. They may
research effective ways to motivate people to address patterns of behavior that contribute to poorer health
(MacDonald, 2013).
FIGURE 1.15 The biopsychosocial model suggests that health/illness is determined by an interaction of these three
factors.
Sport and Exercise Psychology
Researchers in sport and exercise psychology study the psychological aspects of sport performance,
including motivation and performance anxiety, and the effects of sport on mental and emotional wellbeing.
Research is also conducted on similar topics as they relate to physical exercise in general. The discipline also
includes topics that are broader than sport and exercise but that are related to interactions between mental
and physical performance under demanding conditions, such as fire fighting, military operations, artistic
performance, and surgery.
Clinical Psychology
Clinical psychology is the area of psychology that focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of psychological
disorders and other problematic patterns of behavior. As such, it is generally considered to be a more applied
area within psychology; however, some clinicians are also actively engaged in scientific research. Counseling
psychology is a similar discipline that focuses on emotional, social, vocational, and health-related outcomes in
individuals who are considered psychologically healthy.
As mentioned earlier, both Freud and Rogers provided perspectives that have been influential in shaping how
clinicians interact with people seeking psychotherapy. While aspects of the psychoanalytic theory are still
found among some of today’s therapists who are trained from a psychodynamic perspective, Roger’s ideas
about client-centered therapy have been especially influential in shaping how many clinicians operate.
Furthermore, both behaviorism and the cognitive revolution have shaped clinical practice in the forms of
behavioral therapy, cognitive therapy, and cognitive-behavioral therapy (Figure 1.16). Issues related to the
diagnosis and treatment of psychological disorders and problematic patterns of behavior will be discussed in
1.3 • Contemporary Psychology 25
detail in later chapters of this textbook.
FIGURE 1.16 Cognitive-behavioral therapists take cognitive processes and behaviors into account when providing
psychotherapy. This is one of several strategies that may be used by practicing clinical psychologists.
By far, this is the area of psychology that receives the most attention in popular media, and many people
mistakenly assume that all psychology is clinical psychology.
Forensic Psychology
Forensic psychology is a branch of psychology that deals questions of psychology as they arise in the context
of the justice system. For example, forensic psychologists (and forensic psychiatrists) will assess a person’s
competency to stand trial, assess the state of mind of a defendant, act as consultants on child custody cases,
consult on sentencing and treatment recommendations, and advise on issues such as eyewitness testimony
and children’s testimony (American Board of Forensic Psychology, 2014). In these capacities, they will typically
act as expert witnesses, called by either side in a court case to provide their research- or experience-based
opinions. As expert witnesses, forensic psychologists must have a good understanding of the law and provide
information in the context of the legal system rather than just within the realm of psychology. Forensic
psychologists are also used in the jury selection process and witness preparation. They may also be involved in
providing psychological treatment within the criminal justice system. Criminal profilers are a relatively small
proportion of psychologists that act as consultants to law enforcement.
1.4 Careers in Psychology
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Understand educational requirements for careers in academic settings
• Understand the demands of a career in an academic setting
• Understand career options outside of academic settings
Psychologists can work in many different places doing many different things. In general, anyone wishing to
continue a career in psychology at a 4-year institution of higher education will have to earn a doctoral degree
in psychology for some specialties and at least a master’s degree for others. In most areas of psychology, this
means earning a PhD in a relevant area of psychology. Literally, PhD refers to a doctor of philosophy degree,
but here, philosophy does not refer to the field of philosophy per se. Rather, philosophy in this context refers to
many different disciplinary perspectives that would be housed in a traditional college of liberal arts and
sciences.
The requirements to earn a PhD vary from country to country and even from school to school, but usually,
individuals earning this degree must complete a dissertation. A dissertation is essentially a long research
paper or bundled published articles describing research that was conducted as a part of the candidate’s
doctoral training. In the United States, a dissertation generally has to be defended before a committee of expert
26 1 • Introduction to Psychology
Access for free at openstax.org
reviewers before the degree is conferred (Figure 1.17).
FIGURE 1.17 Doctoral degrees are generally conferred in formal ceremonies involving special attire and rites.
(credit: Public Affairs Office Fort Wainwright)
Once someone earns a PhD, they may seek a faculty appointment at a college or university. Being on the faculty
of a college or university often involves dividing time between teaching, research, and service to the institution
and profession. The amount of time spent on each of these primary responsibilities varies dramatically from
school to school, and it is not uncommon for faculty to move from place to place in search of the best personal
fit among various academic environments. The previous section detailed some of the major areas that are
commonly represented in psychology departments around the country; thus, depending on the training
received, an individual could be anything from a biological psychologist to a clinical psychologist in an
academic setting (Figure 1.18).

John Nash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would tell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended for him. He also began to hear voices in his head that he could not control.

These are just a few of the many examples of how people experience the world around them in ways that are unpredictable and difficult to understand. In this chapter, we will explore what psychology is, what it is not, and how it has evolved over time. We will also look at some common misconceptions about psychology. Finally, we will discuss some careers in psychology and the role that psychology plays in our lives. 2. WHAT IS PSYCHOLOGY? The word “psychology” comes from two Greek words, “psyche” and “logos,” which mean “mind” or “thinking.” Psychologists are interested in how the mind works and how we think and feel. They study the mental processes that occur in the brain, such as perception, attention, memory, thinking, problem solving, emotion, motivation, learning, decision making, self-regulation, personality, social behavior, etc. Psychologists use a variety of methods to study these processes, including observation, experiments, surveys, interviews, questionnaires, brain imaging, neuropsychology, cognitive neuroscience, psychometrics, clinical psychology, developmental psychology, ethnopsychology and social psychology. Psychology has a long and rich history. It has been practiced for thousands of years in many different cultures and societies. For example, in ancient Greece, Plato and Aristotle studied psychology in order to understand the nature of human beings and their relationships with each other and with their environment. In the Middle Ages, Christian theologians and philosophers used psychology as a tool for understanding the nature of God and his relationship with his creatures. During the Renaissance, scientists and thinkers such as Galileo Galilei, Isaac Newton, René Descartes, John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Auguste Comte, Jean-Paul Sartre, Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, William James, Edward Thorndike, B.F. Skinner and others developed theories of psychology that continue to shape our understanding of this field today. Today, psychology is a broad and diverse field that encompasses a wide range of subfields and disciplines.

Reflecting the diversity of the field of psychology itself, members, affiliate members, and associate members
span the spectrum from students to doctoral-level psychologists, and come from a variety of places including
educational settings, criminal justice, hospitals, the armed forces, and industry (American Psychological
Association, 2014). G. Stanley Hall was the first president of the APA. Before he earned his doctoral degree, he
was an adjunct instructor at Wilberforce University, a historically Black college/university (HBCU), while
serving as faculty at Antioch College. Hall went on to work under William James, earning his PhD. Eventually,

he became the first president of Clark University in Massachusetts when it was founded (Pickren & Rutherford,
2010).
The Association for Psychological Science (APS) was founded in 1988 and seeks to advance the scientific
orientation of psychology. Its founding resulted from disagreements between members of the scientific and
clinical branches of psychology within the APA. The APS publishes five research journals and engages in
education and advocacy with funding agencies. A significant proportion of its members are international,
although the majority is located in the United States. Other organizations provide networking and
collaboration opportunities for professionals of several ethnic or racial groups working in psychology, such as
the National Latina/o Psychological Association (NLPA), the Asian American Psychological Association (AAPA),
the Association of Black Psychologists (ABPsi), and the Society of Indian Psychologists (SIP). Most of these
groups are also dedicated to studying psychological and social issues within their specific communities.
This section will provide an overview of the major subdivisions within psychology today in the order in which
they are introduced throughout the remainder of this textbook. This is not meant to be an exhaustive listing,
but it will provide insight into the major areas of research and practice of modern-day psychologists.

Biopsychology and Evolutionary Psychology
As the name suggests, biopsychology explores how our biology influences our behavior. While biological
psychology is a broad field, many biological psychologists want to understand how the structure and function
of the nervous system is related to behavior (Figure 1.10). As such, they often combine the research strategies
of both psychologists and physiologists to accomplish this goal (as discussed in Carlson, 2013).
FIGURE 1.10 Biological psychologists study how the structure and function of the nervous system generate
behavior.
The research interests of biological psychologists span a number of domains, including but not limited to,
1.3 • Contemporary Psychology 19
sensory and motor systems, sleep, drug use and abuse, ingestive behavior, reproductive behavior,
neurodevelopment, plasticity of the nervous system, and biological correlates of psychological disorders.
Given the broad areas of interest falling under the purview of biological psychology, it will probably come as no
surprise that individuals from all sorts of backgrounds are involved in this research, including biologists,
medical professionals, physiologists, and chemists. This interdisciplinary approach is often referred to as
neuroscience, of which biological psychology is a component (Carlson, 2013).
While biopsychology typically focuses on the immediate causes of behavior based in the physiology of a
human or other animal, evolutionary psychology seeks to study the ultimate biological causes of behavior. To
the extent that a behavior is impacted by genetics, a behavior, like any anatomical characteristic of a human or
animal, will demonstrate adaption to its surroundings. These surroundings include the physical environment
and, since interactions between organisms can be important to survival and reproduction, the social
environment. The study of behavior in the context of evolution has its origins with Charles Darwin, the co-
discoverer of the theory of evolution by natural selection. Darwin was well aware that behaviors should be
adaptive and wrote books titled, The Descent of Man (1871) and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and
Animals (1872), to explore this field.
Evolutionary psychology, and specifically, the evolutionary psychology of humans, has enjoyed a resurgence in
recent decades. To be subject to evolution by natural selection, a behavior must have a significant genetic
cause. In general, we expect all human cultures to express a behavior if it is caused genetically, since the
genetic differences among human groups are small. The approach taken by most evolutionary psychologists is
to predict the outcome of a behavior in a particular situation based on evolutionary theory and then to make
observations, or conduct experiments, to determine whether the results match the theory. It is important to
recognize that these types of studies are not strong evidence that a behavior is adaptive, since they lack
information that the behavior is in some part genetic and not entirely cultural (Endler, 1986). Demonstrating
that a trait, especially in humans, is naturally selected is extraordinarily difficult; perhaps for this reason,
some evolutionary psychologists are content to assume the behaviors they study have genetic determinants
(Confer et al., 2010).
One other drawback of evolutionary psychology is that the traits that we possess now evolved under
environmental and social conditions far back in human history, and we have a poor understanding of what
these conditions were. This makes predictions about what is adaptive for a behavior difficult. Behavioral traits
need not be adaptive under current conditions, only under the conditions of the past when they evolved, about
which we can only hypothesize.
There are many areas of human behavior for which evolution can make predictions. Examples include
memory, mate choice, relationships between kin, friendship and cooperation, parenting, social organization,
and status (Confer et al., 2010).
Evolutionary psychologists have had success in finding experimental correspondence between observations
and expectations. In one example, in a study of mate preference differences between men and women that
spanned 37 cultures, Buss (1989) found that women valued earning potential factors greater than men, and
men valued potential reproductive factors (youth and attractiveness) greater than women in their prospective
mates. In general, the predictions were in line with the predictions of evolution, although there were deviations
in some cultures.
Sensation and Perception
Scientists interested in both physiological aspects of sensory systems as well as in the psychological
experience of sensory information work within the area of sensation and perception (Figure 1.11). As such,
sensation and perception research is also quite interdisciplinary. Imagine walking between buildings as you
move from one class to another. You are inundated with sights, sounds, touch sensations, and smells. You also
experience the temperature of the air around you and maintain your balance as you make your way. These are
20 1 • Introduction to Psychology

all factors of interest to someone working in the domain of sensation and perception.
FIGURE 1.11 When you look at this image, you may see a duck or a rabbit. The sensory information remains the
same, but your perception can vary dramatically.
As described in a later chapter that focuses on the results of studies in sensation and perception, our
experience of our world is not as simple as the sum total of all of the sensory information (or sensations)
together. Rather, our experience (or perception) is complex and is influenced by where we focus our attention,
our previous experiences, and even our cultural backgrounds.
Cognitive Psychology
As mentioned in the previous section, the cognitive revolution created an impetus for psychologists to focus
their attention on better understanding the mind and mental processes that underlie behavior. Thus, cognitive
psychology is the area of psychology that focuses on studying cognitions, or thoughts, and their relationship to
our experiences and our actions. Like biological psychology, cognitive psychology is broad in its scope and
often involves collaborations among people from a diverse range of disciplinary backgrounds. This has led
some to coin the term cognitive science to describe the interdisciplinary nature of this area of research (Miller,
2003).
Cognitive psychologists have research interests that span a spectrum of topics, ranging from attention to
problem solving to language to memory. The approaches used in studying these topics are equally diverse.
Given such diversity, cognitive psychology is not captured in one chapter of this text per se; rather, various
concepts related to cognitive psychology will be covered in relevant portions of the chapters in this text on
sensation and perception, thinking and intelligence, memory, lifespan development, social psychology, and
therapy.
Developmental Psychology
Developmental psychology is the scientific study of development across a lifespan. Developmental
psychologists are interested in processes related to physical maturation. However, their focus is not limited to
the physical changes associated with aging, as they also focus on changes in cognitive skills, moral reasoning,
social behavior, and other psychological attributes.
Early developmental psychologists focused primarily on changes that occurred through reaching adulthood,
providing enormous insight into the differences in physical, cognitive, and social capacities that exist between
very young children and adults. For instance, research by Jean Piaget (Figure 1.12) demonstrated that very
young children do not demonstrate object permanence. Object permanence refers to the understanding that
physical things continue to exist, even if they are hidden from us. If you were to show an adult a toy, and then
hide it behind a curtain, the adult knows that the toy still exists. However, very young infants act as if a hidden
object no longer exists. The age at which object permanence is achieved is somewhat controversial (Munakata,
McClelland, Johnson, and Siegler, 1997).
1.3 • Contemporary Psychology 21
FIGURE 1.12 Jean Piaget is famous for his theories regarding changes in cognitive ability that occur as we move
from infancy to adulthood.
While Piaget was focused on cognitive changes during infancy and childhood as we move to adulthood, there is
an increasing interest in extending research into the changes that occur much later in life. This may be
reflective of changing population demographics of developed nations as a whole. As more and more people live
longer lives, the number of people of advanced age will continue to increase. Indeed, it is estimated that there
were just over 40 million people aged 65 or older living in the United States in 2010. However, by 2020, this
number is expected to increase to about 55 million. By the year 2050, it is estimated that nearly 90 million
people in this country will be 65 or older (Department of Health and Human Services, n.d.).
Personality Psychology
Personality psychology focuses on patterns of thoughts and behaviors that make each individual unique.
Several individuals (e.g., Freud and Maslow) that we have already discussed in our historical overview of
psychology, and the American psychologist Gordon Allport, contributed to early theories of personality. These
early theorists attempted to explain how an individual’s personality develops from their given perspective. For
example, Freud proposed that personality arose as conflicts between the conscious and unconscious parts of
the mind were carried out over the lifespan. Specifically, Freud theorized that an individual went through
various psychosexual stages of development. According to Freud, adult personality would result from the
resolution of various conflicts that centered on the migration of erogenous (or sexual pleasure-producing)
zones from the oral (mouth) to the anus to the phallus to the genitals. Like many of Freud’s theories, this
particular idea was controversial and did not lend itself to experimental tests (Person, 1980).
More recently, the study of personality has taken on a more quantitative approach. Rather than explaining how
personality arises, research is focused on identifying personality traits, measuring these traits, and
determining how these traits interact in a particular context to determine how a person will behave in any
given situation. Personality traits are relatively consistent patterns of thought and behavior, and many have
proposed that five trait dimensions are sufficient to capture the variations in personality seen across
individuals. These five dimensions are known as the “Big Five” or the Five Factor model, and include
dimensions of conscientiousness, agreeableness, neuroticism, openness, and extraversion (Figure 1.13). Each
of these traits has been demonstrated to be relatively stable over the lifespan (e.g., Rantanen, Metsäpelto, Feldt,
Pulkinnen, and Kokko, 2007; Soldz & Vaillant, 1999; McCrae & Costa, 2008) and is influenced by genetics (e.g.,
Jang, Livesly, and Vernon, 1996).

3.1 Human Genetics
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Explain the basic principles of the theory of evolution by natural selection
• Describe the differences between genotype and phenotype
• Discuss how gene-environment interactions are critical for expression of physical and psychological
characteristics
Psychological researchers study genetics in order to better understand the biological factors that contribute to
certain behaviors. While all humans share certain biological mechanisms, we are each unique. And while our
bodies have many of the same parts—brains and hormones and cells with genetic codes—these are expressed
in a wide variety of behaviors, thoughts, and reactions.
Why do two people infected by the same disease have different outcomes: one surviving and one succumbing
to the ailment? How are genetic diseases passed through family lines? Are there genetic components to
psychological disorders, such as depression or schizophrenia? To what extent might there be a psychological
basis to health conditions such as childhood obesity?
To explore these questions, let’s start by focusing on a specific genetic disorder, sickle cell anemia, and how it
might manifest in two affected sisters. Sickle-cell anemia is a genetic condition in which red blood cells, which
are normally round, take on a crescent-like shape (Figure 3.2). The changed shape of these cells affects how
they function: sickle-shaped cells can clog blood vessels and block blood flow, leading to high fever, severe
pain, swelling, and tissue damage.
FIGURE 3.2 Normal blood cells travel freely through the blood vessels, while sickle-shaped cells form blockages
preventing blood flow.
Many people with sickle-cell anemia—and the particular genetic mutation that causes it—die at an early age.
While the notion of “survival of the fittest” may suggest that people with this disorder have a low survival rate
and therefore the disorder will become less common, this is not the case. Despite the negative evolutionary
effects associated with this genetic mutation, the sickle-cell gene remains relatively common among people of
African descent. Why is this? The explanation is illustrated with the following scenario.
Imagine two young women—Luwi and Sena—sisters in rural Zambia, Africa. Luwi carries the gene for sickle-
cell anemia; Sena does not carry the gene. Sickle-cell carriers have one copy of the sickle-cell gene but do not
have full-blown sickle-cell anemia. They experience symptoms only if they are severely dehydrated or are
deprived of oxygen (as in mountain climbing). Carriers are thought to be immune from malaria (an often
deadly disease that is widespread in tropical climates) because changes in their blood chemistry and immune
functioning prevent the malaria parasite from having its effects (Gong, Parikh, Rosenthal, & Greenhouse,
2013). However, full-blown sickle-cell anemia, with two copies of the sickle-cell gene, does not provide
immunity to malaria.

While walking home from school, both sisters are bitten by mosquitoes carrying the malaria parasite. Luwi is
protected against malaria because she carries the sickle-cell mutation. Sena, on the other hand, develops
malaria and dies just two weeks later. Luwi survives and eventually has children, to whom she may pass on the
sickle-cell mutation.

Malaria is rare in the United States, so the sickle-cell gene benefits nobody: the gene manifests primarily in
minor health problems for carriers with one copy, or a severe full-blown disease with no health benefits for
carriers with two copies. However, the situation is quite different in other parts of the world. In parts of Africa
where malaria is prevalent, having the sickle-cell mutation does provide health benefits for carriers
(protection from malaria).
The story of malaria fits with Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection (Figure 3.3). In simple
terms, the theory states that organisms that are better suited for their environment will survive and reproduce,
while those that are poorly suited for their environment will die off. In our example, we can see that, as a
carrier, Luwi’s mutation is highly adaptive in her African homeland; however, if she resided in the United
States (where malaria is rare), her mutation could prove costly—with a high probability of the disease in her
descendants and minor health problems of her own.

Origin of Species. (b) The book contains just one illustration: this diagram that shows how species evolve over time
through natural selection.
Two Perspectives on Genetics and Behavior
It’s easy to get confused about two fields that study the interaction of genes and the environment, such as the
fields of evolutionary psychology and behavioral genetics. How can we tell them apart?
In both fields, it is understood that genes not only code for particular traits, but also contribute to certain
patterns of cognition and behavior. Evolutionary psychology focuses on how universal patterns of behavior and
cognitive processes have evolved over time. Therefore, variations in cognition and behavior would make
individuals more or less successful in reproducing and passing those genes on to their offspring. Evolutionary
psychologists study a variety of psychological phenomena that may have evolved as adaptations, including fear

response, food preferences, mate selection, and cooperative behaviors (Confer et al., 2010).
Whereas evolutionary psychologists focus on universal patterns that evolved over millions of years, behavioral
geneticists study how individual differences arise, in the present, through the interaction of genes and the
environment. When studying human behavior, behavioral geneticists often employ twin and adoption studies to
research questions of interest. Twin studies compare the likelihood that a given behavioral trait is shared among
identical and fraternal twins; adoption studies compare those rates among biologically related relatives and
adopted relatives. Both approaches provide some insight into the relative importance of genes and environment
for the expression of a given trait.

Genetic Variation
Genetic variation, the genetic difference between individuals, is what contributes to a species’ adaptation to its
environment. In humans, genetic variation begins with an egg, about 100 million sperm, and fertilization.
Roughly once per month, active ovaries release an egg from follicles. During the egg's journey from the ovary
through the fallopian tubes, to the uterus, a sperm may fertilize the egg.
The egg and the sperm each contain 23 chromosomes. Chromosomes are long strings of genetic material
known as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). DNA is a helix-shaped molecule made up of nucleotide base pairs. In
each chromosome, sequences of DNA make up genes that control or partially control a number of visible
characteristics, known as traits, such as eye color, hair color, and so on. A single gene may have multiple
possible variations, or alleles. An allele is a specific version of a gene. So, a given gene may code for the trait of
hair color, and the different alleles of that gene affect which hair color an individual has.
When a sperm and egg fuse, their 23 chromosomes combine to create a zygote with 46 chromosomes (23
pairs). Therefore, each parent contributes half the genetic information carried by the offspring; the resulting
physical characteristics of the offspring (called the phenotype) are determined by the interaction of genetic
material supplied by the sperm and egg (called the genotype). A person’s genotype is the genetic makeup of
that individual. Phenotype, on the other hand, refers to the individual’s inherited physical characteristics,
which are a combination of genetic and environmental influences (Figure 3.4).
FIGURE 3.4 (a) Genotype refers to the genetic makeup of an individual based on the genetic material (DNA)
inherited from one’s genetic contributors. (b) Phenotype describes an individual’s observable characteristics, such
as hair color, skin color, height, and build. (credit a: modification of work by Caroline Davis; credit b: modification of
work by Cory Zanker)
Note that, in genetics and reproduction, ""parent"" is often used to describe the individual organisms that
74 3 • Biopsychology
Access for free at openstax.org
contribute genetic material to offspring, usually in the form of gamete cells (sperm and egg). The concept of a
genetic parent is distinct from social and legal concepts of parenthood, and may differ from those whom
people consider their parents.
Most traits are controlled by multiple genes, but some traits are controlled by one gene. A characteristic like
cleft chin, for example, is influenced by a single gene from each parent. In this example, we will call the gene
for cleft chin “B,” and the gene for smooth chin “b.” Cleft chin is a dominant trait, which means that having the
dominant allele either from one parent (Bb) or both parents (BB) will always result in the phenotype
associated with the dominant allele. When someone has two copies of the same allele, they are said to be
homozygous for that allele. When someone has a combination of alleles for a given gene, they are said to be
heterozygous. For example, smooth chin is a recessive trait, which means that an individual will only display
the smooth chin phenotype if they are homozygous for that recessive allele (bb).
Imagine that a person with a cleft chin mates with a person with a smooth chin. What type of chin will their
offspring have? The answer to that depends on which alleles each parent carries. If the person with a cleft is
homozygous for cleft chin (BB), their offspring will always have cleft chin. It gets a little more complicated,
however, if the person is heterozygous for this gene (Bb). Since the other person has a smooth chin—therefore
homozygous for the recessive allele (bb)—we can expect the offspring to have a 50% chance of having a cleft
chin and a 50% chance of having a smooth chin (Figure 3.5).
FIGURE 3.5 (a) A Punnett square is a tool used to predict how genes will interact in the production of offspring. The
capital B represents the dominant allele, and the lowercase b represents the recessive allele. In the example of the
cleft chin, where B is cleft chin (dominant allele), wherever a pair contains the dominant allele, B, you can expect a
cleft chin phenotype. You can expect a smooth chin phenotype only when there are two copies of the recessive
allele, bb. (b) A cleft chin, shown here, is an inherited trait.
In sickle cell anemia, heterozygous carriers (like Luwi from the example) can develop blood resistance to
malaria infection while those who are homozygous (like Sena) have a potentially lethal blood disorder. Sickle-
cell anemia is just one of many genetic disorders caused by the pairing of two recessive genes. For example,
phenylketonuria (PKU) is a condition in which individuals lack an enzyme that normally converts harmful
amino acids into harmless byproducts. If someone with this condition goes untreated, they will experience
significant deficits in cognitive function, seizures, and an increased risk of various psychiatric disorders.
Because PKU is a recessive trait, each parent must have at least one copy of the recessive allele in order to
produce a child with the condition (Figure 3.6).
So far, we have discussed traits that involve just one gene, but few human characteristics are controlled by a
single gene. Most traits are polygenic: controlled by more than one gene. Height is one example of a polygenic
trait, as are skin color and weight.
3.1 • Human Genetics 75
FIGURE 3.6 In this Punnett square, N represents the normal allele, and p represents the recessive allele that is
associated with PKU. If two individuals mate who are both heterozygous for the allele associated with PKU, their
offspring have a 25% chance of expressing the PKU phenotype.
Where do harmful genes that contribute to diseases like PKU come from? Gene mutations provide one source
of harmful genes. A mutation is a sudden, permanent change in a gene. While many mutations can be harmful
or lethal, once in a while, a mutation benefits an individual by giving that person an advantage over those who
do not have the mutation. Recall that the theory of evolution asserts that individuals best adapted to their
particular environments are more likely to reproduce and pass on their genes to future generations. In order
for this process to occur, there must be competition—more technically, there must be variability in genes (and
resultant traits) that allow for variation in adaptability to the environment. If a population consisted of
identical individuals, then any dramatic changes in the environment would affect everyone in the same way,
and there would be no variation in selection. In contrast, diversity in genes and associated traits allows some
individuals to perform slightly better than others when faced with environmental change. This creates a
distinct advantage for individuals best suited for their environments in terms of successful reproduction and
genetic transmission.
Human Diversity
This chapter focuses on biology. Later in this course you will learn about social psychology and issues of race,
prejudice, and discrimination. When we focus strictly on biology, race becomes a weak construct. After the
sequencing of the human genome at the turn of the millennium, many scientists began to argue that race was not
a useful variable in genetic research and that its continued use represents a potential source of confusion and
harm. The racial categories that some believed to be helpful in studying genetic diversity in humans are largely
irrelevant. A person's skin tone, eye color, and hair texture are functions of their genetic makeups, but there is
actually more genetic variation within a given racial category than there is between racial categories. In some
cases, focus on race has led to difficulties with misdiagnoses and/or under-diagnoses of diseases ranging from
sickle cell anemia to cystic fibrosis. Some argue that we need to distinguish between ancestry and race and then
focus on ancestry. This approach would facilitate greater understanding of human genetic diversity (Yudell,
Roberts, DeSalle, & Tishkoff, 2016).

Walter Mischel and the Person-Situation Debate
Walter Mischel was a student of Julian Rotter and taught for years at Stanford, where he was a colleague of
Albert Bandura. Mischel surveyed several decades of empirical psychological literature regarding trait
prediction of behavior, and his conclusion shook the foundations of personality psychology. Mischel found that
the data did not support the central principle of the field—that a person’s personality traits are consistent
across situations. His report triggered a decades-long period of self-examination, known as the person-
situation debate, among personality psychologists.
Mischel suggested that perhaps we were looking for consistency in the wrong places. He found that although
behavior was inconsistent across different situations, it was much more consistent within situations—so that a
person’s behavior in one situation would likely be repeated in a similar one. And as you will see next regarding
his famous “marshmallow test,” Mischel also found that behavior is consistent in equivalent situations across
time.
One of Mischel’s most notable contributions to personality psychology was his ideas on self-regulation.
According to Lecci & Magnavita (2013), “Self-regulation is the process of identifying a goal or set of goals and,
in pursuing these goals, using both internal (e.g., thoughts and affect) and external (e.g., responses of anything
or anyone in the environment) feedback to maximize goal attainment” (p. 6.3). Self-regulation is also known as
will power. When we talk about will power, we tend to think of it as the ability to delay gratification. For
example, Bettina’s teenage son made strawberry cupcakes, and they looked delicious. However, Bettina
forfeited the pleasure of eating one, because she is training for a 5K race and wants to be fit and do well in the
race. Would you be able to resist getting a small reward now in order to get a larger reward later? This is the
question Mischel investigated in his now-classic marshmallow test.
Mischel designed a study to assess self-regulation in young children. In the marshmallow study, Mischel and
his colleagues placed a preschool child in a room with one marshmallow on the table. The children were told
they could either eat the marshmallow now, or wait until the researcher returned to the room, and then they
could have two marshmallows (Mischel, Ebbesen & Raskoff, 1972). This was repeated with hundreds of
preschoolers. What Mischel and his team found was that young children differ in their degree of self-control.
Mischel and his colleagues continued to follow this group of preschoolers through high school, and what do
you think they discovered? The children who had more self-control in preschool (the ones who waited for the
bigger reward) were more successful in high school. They had higher SAT scores, had positive peer
relationships, and were less likely to have substance abuse issues; as adults, they also had more stable
marriages (Mischel, Shoda, & Rodriguez, 1989; Mischel et al., 2010). On the other hand, those children who had
poor self-control in preschool (the ones who grabbed the one marshmallow) were not as successful in high
school, and they were found to have academic and behavioral problems. A more recent study using a larger
and more representative sample found associations between early delay of gratification (Watts, Duncan, &
376 11 • Personality

Quan, 2018) and measures of achievement in adolescence. However, researchers also found that the
associations were not as strong as those reported during Mischel's initial experiment and were quite sensitive
to situational factors such as early measures of cognitive capacity, family background, and home environment.
This research suggests that consideration of situational factors is important to better understand behavior.

more and to see the test given to children in Colombia.
Today, the debate is mostly resolved, and most psychologists consider both the situation and personal factors
in understanding behavior. For Mischel (1993), people are situation processors. The children in the
marshmallow test each processed, or interpreted, the rewards structure of that situation in their own way.
Mischel’s approach to personality stresses the importance of both the situation and the way the person
perceives the situation. Instead of behavior being determined by the situation, people use cognitive processes
to interpret the situation and then behave in accordance with that interpretation.
11.5 Humanistic Approaches
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Discuss the contributions of Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers to personality development
As the “third force” in psychology, humanism is touted as a reaction both to the pessimistic determinism of
psychoanalysis, with its emphasis on psychological disturbance, and to the behaviorists’ view of humans
passively reacting to the environment, which has been criticized as making people out to be personality-less
robots. It does not suggest that psychoanalytic, behaviorist, and other points of view are incorrect but argues
that these perspectives do not recognize the depth and meaning of human experience, and fail to recognize the
innate capacity for self-directed change and transforming personal experiences. This perspective focuses on
how healthy people develop. One pioneering humanist, Abraham Maslow, studied people who he considered to
be healthy, creative, and productive, including Albert Einstein, Eleanor Roosevelt, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham
Lincoln, and others. Maslow (1950, 1970) found that such people share similar characteristics, such as being
open, creative, loving, spontaneous, compassionate, concerned for others, and accepting of themselves. When
you studied motivation, you learned about one of the best-known humanistic theories, Maslow's hierarchy of
needs theory, in which Maslow proposes that human beings have certain needs in common and that these
needs must be met in a certain order. The highest need is the need for self-actualization, which is the
achievement of our fullest potential. Maslow differentiated between needs that motivate us to fulfill something
that is missing and needs that inspire us to grow. He believed that many emotional and behavioral concerns
arise as a result of failing to meet these hierarchical needs.
Another humanistic theorist was Carl Rogers. One of Rogers’s main ideas about personality regards self-
concept, our thoughts and feelings about ourselves. How would you respond to the question, “Who am I?” Your
answer can show how you see yourself. If your response is primarily positive, then you tend to feel good about
who you are, and you see the world as a safe and positive place. If your response is mainly negative, then you
may feel unhappy with who you are. Rogers further divided the self into two categories: the ideal self and the
real self. The ideal self is the person that you would like to be; the real self is the person you actually are.
Rogers focused on the idea that we need to achieve consistency between these two selves. We experience
congruence when our thoughts about our real self and ideal self are very similar—in other words, when our
self-concept is accurate. High congruence leads to a greater sense of self-worth and a healthy, productive life.
Parents can help their children achieve this by giving them unconditional positive regard, or unconditional
love. According to Rogers (1980), “As persons are accepted and prized, they tend to develop a more caring
attitude towards themselves” (p. 116). Conversely, when there is a great discrepancy between our ideal and
11.5 • Humanistic Approaches 377
actual selves, we experience a state Rogers called incongruence, which can lead to maladjustment. Both
Rogers’s and Maslow’s theories focus on individual choices and do not believe that biology is deterministic.

• Discuss the findings of the Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart as they relate to personality and genetics
• Discuss temperament and describe the three infant temperaments identified by Thomas and Chess
• Discuss the evolutionary perspective on personality development
How much of our personality is in-born and biological, and how much is influenced by the environment and
culture we are raised in? Psychologists who favor the biological approach believe that inherited
predispositions as well as physiological processes can be used to explain differences in our personalities
(Burger, 2008).
Evolutionary psychology relative to personality development looks at personality traits that are universal, as
well as differences across individuals. In this view, adaptive differences have evolved and then provide a
survival and reproductive advantage. Individual differences are important from an evolutionary viewpoint for
several reasons. Certain individual differences, and the heritability of these characteristics, have been well
documented. David Buss has identified several theories to explore this relationship between personality traits
and evolution, such as life-history theory, which looks at how people expend their time and energy (such as on
bodily growth and maintenance, reproduction, or parenting). Another example is costly signaling theory,
which examines the honesty and deception in the signals people send one another about their quality as a
mate or friend (Buss, 2009).
In the field of behavioral genetics, the Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart—a well-known study of the
genetic basis for personality—conducted research with twins from 1979 to 1999. In studying 350 pairs of
twins, including pairs of identical and fraternal twins reared together and apart, researchers found that
identical twins, whether raised together or apart, have very similar personalities (Bouchard, 1994; Bouchard,
Lykken, McGue, Segal, & Tellegen, 1990; Segal, 2012). These findings suggest the heritability of some
personality traits. Heritability refers to the proportion of difference among people that is attributed to
genetics. Some of the traits that the study reported as having more than a 0.50 heritability ratio include
leadership, obedience to authority, a sense of well-being, alienation, resistance to stress, and fearfulness. The
implication is that some aspects of our personalities are largely controlled by genetics; however, it’s important
to point out that traits are not determined by a single gene, but by a combination of many genes, as well as by
epigenetic factors that control whether the genes are expressed.
Other research that has examined the link between personality and other factors has identified and studied
Type A and Type B personalities, which you will learn more about in the chapter on Stress, Health, and
Lifestyle.

Temperament
Most contemporary psychologists believe temperament has a biological basis due to its appearance very early
in our lives (Rothbart, 2011). As you learned when you studied lifespan development, Thomas and Chess
(1977) found that babies could be categorized into one of three temperaments: easy, difficult, or slow to warm
up. However, environmental factors (family interactions, for example) and maturation can affect the ways in
which children’s personalities are expressed (Carter et al., 2008).

Research suggests that there are two dimensions of our temperament that are important parts of our adult
personality—reactivity and self-regulation (Rothbart, Ahadi, & Evans, 2000). Reactivity refers to how we
respond to new or challenging environmental stimuli; self-regulation refers to our ability to control that
response (Rothbart & Derryberry, 1981; Rothbart, Sheese, Rueda, & Posner, 2011). For example, one person
may immediately respond to new stimuli with a high level of anxiety, while another barely notices it.
11.7 Trait Theorists
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Discuss early trait theories of Cattell and Eysenck
• Discuss the Big Five factors and describe someone who is high and low on each of the five factors
Trait theorists believe personality can be understood via the approach that all people have certain traits, or
characteristic ways of behaving. Do you tend to be sociable or shy? Passive or aggressive? Optimistic or
pessimistic? Moody or even-tempered? Early trait theorists tried to describe all human personality traits. For
example, one trait theorist, Gordon Allport (Allport & Odbert, 1936), found 4,500 words in the English language
that could describe people. He organized these personality traits into three categories: cardinal traits, central
traits, and secondary traits. A cardinal trait is one that dominates your entire personality, and hence your
life—such as Ebenezer Scrooge’s greed and Mother Theresa’s altruism. Cardinal traits are not very common:
Few people have personalities dominated by a single trait. Instead, our personalities typically are composed of
multiple traits. Central traits are those that make up our personalities (such as loyal, kind, agreeable, friendly,
sneaky, wild, and grouchy). Secondary traits are those that are not quite as obvious or as consistent as central
traits. They are present under specific circumstances and include preferences and attitudes. For example, one
person gets angry when people try to tickle him; another can only sleep on the left side of the bed; and yet
another always orders her salad dressing on the side. And you—although not normally an anxious person—feel
nervous before making a speech in front of your English class.
In an effort to make the list of traits more manageable, Raymond Cattell (1946, 1957) narrowed down the list to
about 171 traits. However, saying that a trait is either present or absent does not accurately reflect a person’s
uniqueness, because all of our personalities are actually made up of the same traits; we differ only in the
degree to which each trait is expressed. Cattell (1957) identified 16 factors or dimensions of personality:
warmth, reasoning, emotional stability, dominance, liveliness, rule-consciousness, social boldness, sensitivity,
vigilance, abstractedness, privateness, apprehension, openness to change, self-reliance, perfectionism, and
tension (Table 11.5). He developed a personality assessment based on these 16 factors, called the 16PF.
Instead of a trait being present or absent, each dimension is scored over a continuum, from high to low. For
example, your level of warmth describes how warm, caring, and nice to others you are. If you score low on this
index, you tend to be more distant and cold. A high score on this index signifies you are supportive and
comforting.
Personality Factors Measured by the 16PF Questionnaire

Warmth Reserved, detached Outgoing, supportive
Intellect Concrete thinker Analytical

Psychologists Hans and Sybil Eysenck were personality theorists (Figure 11.12) who focused on temperament,
the inborn, genetically based personality differences that you studied earlier in the chapter. They believed
personality is largely governed by biology. The Eysencks (Eysenck, 1990, 1992; Eysenck & Eysenck, 1963)
viewed people as having two specific personality dimensions: extroversion/introversion and neuroticism/
stability.

Board of Education civil rights case (http://openstax.org/l/crogers2) to learn more. The American Psychological Association has several ethnically based organizations for professional psychologists that facilitate interactions among members. Since psychologists belonging to specific ethnic groups or cultures have the most interest in studying the psychology of their communities, these organizations provide an opportunity for the growth of research on the interplay between culture and psychology. WOMEN IN PSYCHOLOGY Although rarely given credit, women have been contributing to psychology since its inception as a field of study. In 1894, Margaret Floy Washburn was the first woman awarded the doctoral degree in psychology. She wrote The Animal Mind: A Textbook of Comparative Psychology, and it was the standard in the field for over 20 years. In the mid 1890s, Mary Whiton Calkins completed all requirements toward the PhD in psychology, but Harvard University refused to award her that degree because she was a woman. She had been taught and mentored by William James, who tried and failed to convince Harvard to award her the doctoral degree. Her memory research studied primacy and recency (Madigan & O’Hara, 1992), and she also wrote about how structuralism and functionalism both explained self-psychology (Calkins, 1906). Another influential woman, Mary Cover Jones, conducted a study she considered to be a sequel to John B. Watson’s study of Little Albert (you’ll learn about this study in the chapter on Learning). Jones unconditioned fear in Little Peter, who had been afraid of rabbits (Jones, 1924). Ethnic minority women contributing to the field of psychology include Martha Bernal and Inez Beverly Prosser; their studies were related to education. Bernal, the first Latina to earn her doctoral degree in psychology (1962) conducted much of her research with Mexican American children. Prosser was the first African American woman awarded the PhD in 1933 at the University of Cincinnati (Benjamin et al.). Women have also contributed to psychological research in other areas, such as the development of the psychoanalytic school of thought, which was founded by Sigmund Freud. Freud’s work was heavily influenced by the work of Wilhelm Wundt, a German physiologist who conducted the world’s first psychological experiments in Leipzig, Germany. The first women to receive a Ph.D. in psychoanalysis were Anna Freud and Ingrid Bergman (Freud & Bergmann). In addition to these women, there are a number of other women who have made significant contributions to the psychology field. For example, Elizabeth Loftus is an expert witness in criminal cases and has been involved in several high-profile cases, including the 9/11 attacks and the Columbine high school shootings. She is also the author of several books on memory and memory research, as well as her own popular book, Memory: The Science of Remembering (Loftus). She has received numerous awards for her contributions to the science of memory (e.g., National Medal of Science, National Academy of Sciences, American Psychological Association, Association for Psychological Science). In addition, she is a professor at Stanford University, where she has taught psychology for more than 40 years. Women in Psychology: An Ethnographic Perspective In this chapter, we will explore the contributions of women psychologists to our understanding of human behaviors and mental processes. We will also examine the ways in which these contributions have influenced the way that psychology is practiced today. We will begin with a brief overview of how psychology has evolved over the past two centuries. This will help us to understand the role that women played in this evolution and how their contributions are relevant to today’s research and practice. Psychology has gone through many changes throughout its history. Initially, psychology was primarily concerned with understanding the mind and behavior of humans. However, over time, it has become increasingly focused on studying animals and other non-human organisms. As a result, psychologists have had to adapt their research methods and theories in order to study these different types of organisms. This adaptation has resulted in a greater diversity of perspectives and approaches to understanding human and animal behavior. In the nineteenth century, many psychologists were influenced by the ideas of John Stuart Mill. Mill argued that humans are rational beings who can reason and make decisions based on reason.

5.6 Gestalt Principles of Perception
Imagine standing on a city street corner. You might be struck by movement everywhere as
cars and people go about their business, by the sound of a street musician’s melody or a horn honking in the
distance, by the smell of exhaust fumes or of food being sold by a nearby vendor, and by the sensation of hard
pavement under your feet.
We rely on our sensory systems to provide important information about our surroundings. We use this
information to successfully navigate and interact with our environment so that we can find nourishment, seek
shelter, maintain social relationships, and avoid potentially dangerous situations.
This chapter will provide an overview of how sensory information is received and processed by the nervous
system and how that affects our conscious experience of the world. We begin by learning the distinction
between sensation and perception. Then we consider the physical properties of light and sound stimuli, along
with an overview of the basic structure and function of the major sensory systems. The chapter will close with
a discussion of a historically important theory of perception called Gestalt.
5Sensation and Perception
5.1 Sensation versus Perception
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Distinguish between sensation and perception
• Describe the concepts of absolute threshold and difference threshold
• Discuss the roles attention, motivation, and sensory adaptation play in perception
Sensation
What does it mean to sense something? Sensory receptors are specialized neurons that respond to specific
types of stimuli. When sensory information is detected by a sensory receptor, sensation has occurred. For
example, light that enters the eye causes chemical changes in cells that line the back of the eye. These cells
relay messages, in the form of action potentials (as you learned when studying biopsychology), to the central
nervous system. The conversion from sensory stimulus energy to action potential is known as transduction.
You have probably known since elementary school that we have five senses: vision, hearing (audition), smell
(olfaction), taste (gustation), and touch (somatosensation). It turns out that this notion of five senses is
oversimplified. We also have sensory systems that provide information about balance (the vestibular sense),
body position and movement (proprioception and kinesthesia), pain (nociception), and temperature
(thermoception).
The sensitivity of a given sensory system to the relevant stimuli can be expressed as an absolute threshold.
Absolute threshold refers to the minimum amount of stimulus energy that must be present for the stimulus to
be detected 50% of the time. Another way to think about this is by asking how dim can a light be or how soft
can a sound be and still be detected half of the time. The sensitivity of our sensory receptors can be quite
amazing. It has been estimated that on a clear night, the most sensitive sensory cells in the back of the eye can
detect a candle flame 30 miles away (Okawa & Sampath, 2007). Under quiet conditions, the hair cells (the
receptor cells of the inner ear) can detect the tick of a clock 20 feet away (Galanter, 1962).
It is also possible for us to get messages that are presented below the threshold for conscious awareness—these
are called subliminal messages. A stimulus reaches a physiological threshold when it is strong enough to
excite sensory receptors and send nerve impulses to the brain: This is an absolute threshold. A message below
that threshold is said to be subliminal: We receive it, but we are not consciously aware of it. Over the years
there has been a great deal of speculation about the use of subliminal messages in advertising, rock music, and
self-help audio programs. Research evidence shows that in laboratory settings, people can process and
respond to information outside of awareness. But this does not mean that we obey these messages like
zombies; in fact, hidden messages have little effect on behavior outside the laboratory (Kunst-Wilson & Zajonc,
1980; Rensink, 2004; Nelson, 2008; Radel, Sarrazin, Legrain, & Gobancé, 2009; Loersch, Durso, & Petty, 2013).
Absolute thresholds are generally measured under incredibly controlled conditions in situations that are
optimal for sensitivity. Sometimes, we are more interested in how much difference in stimuli is required to
detect a difference between them. This is known as the just noticeable difference (jnd) or difference
threshold. Unlike the absolute threshold, the difference threshold changes depending on the stimulus
intensity. As an example, imagine yourself in a very dark movie theater. If an audience member were to receive
a text message that caused the cell phone screen to light up, chances are that many people would notice the
change in illumination in the theater. However, if the same thing happened in a brightly lit arena during a
basketball game, very few people would notice. The cell phone brightness does not change, but its ability to be
detected as a change in illumination varies dramatically between the two contexts. Ernst Weber proposed this
theory of change in difference threshold in the 1830s, and it has become known as Weber’s law: The difference
threshold is a constant fraction of the original stimulus, as the example illustrates.

Perception
While our sensory receptors are constantly collecting information from the environment, it is ultimately how
we interpret that information that affects how we interact with the world. Perception refers to the way sensory
information is organized, interpreted, and consciously experienced. Perception involves both bottom-up and
top-down processing. Bottom-up processing refers to sensory information from a stimulus in the
environment driving a process, and top-down processing refers to knowledge and expectancy driving a
process, as shown in Figure 5.2 (Egeth & Yantis, 1997; Fine & Minnery, 2009; Yantis & Egeth, 1999).
FIGURE 5.2 Top-down and bottom-up are ways we process our perceptions.
Imagine that you and some friends are sitting in a crowded restaurant eating lunch and talking. It is very noisy,
and you are concentrating on your friend’s face to hear what they are saying, then the sound of breaking glass
and clang of metal pans hitting the floor rings out. The server dropped a large tray of food. Although you were
attending to your meal and conversation, that crashing sound would likely get through your attentional filters
and capture your attention. You would have no choice but to notice it. That attentional capture would be caused
by the sound from the environment: it would be bottom-up.
Alternatively, top-down processes are generally goal directed, slow, deliberate, effortful, and under your
control (Fine & Minnery, 2009; Miller & Cohen, 2001; Miller & D'Esposito, 2005). For instance, if you misplaced
your keys, how would you look for them? If you had a yellow key fob, you would probably look for yellowness of
a certain size in specific locations, such as on the counter, coffee table, and other similar places. You would not
look for yellowness on your ceiling fan, because you know keys are not normally lying on top of a ceiling fan.
That act of searching for a certain size of yellowness in some locations and not others would be top-
down—under your control and based on your experience.
One way to think of this concept is that sensation is a physical process, whereas perception is psychological.
For example, upon walking into a kitchen and smelling the scent of baking cinnamon rolls, the sensation is the
scent receptors detecting the odor of cinnamon, but the perception may be “Mmm, this smells like the bread
Grandma used to bake when the family gathered for holidays.”
Although our perceptions are built from sensations, not all sensations result in perception. In fact, we often
don’t perceive stimuli that remain relatively constant over prolonged periods of time. This is known as
sensory adaptation. Imagine going to a city that you have never visited. You check in to the hotel, but when
you get to your room, there is a road construction sign with a bright flashing light outside your window.
Unfortunately, there are no other rooms available, so you are stuck with a flashing light. You decide to watch
television to unwind. The flashing light was extremely annoying when you first entered your room. It was as if
someone was continually turning a bright yellow spotlight on and off in your room, but after watching
television for a short while, you no longer notice the light flashing. The light is still flashing and filling your
room with yellow light every few seconds, and the photoreceptors in your eyes still sense the light, but you no
longer perceive the rapid changes in lighting conditions. That you no longer perceive the flashing light
demonstrates sensory adaptation and shows that while closely associated, sensation and perception are
different.
5.1 • Sensation versus Perception 147
There is another factor that affects sensation and perception: attention. Attention plays a significant role in
determining what is sensed versus what is perceived. Imagine you are at a party full of music, chatter, and
laughter. You get involved in an interesting conversation with a friend, and you tune out all the background
noise. If someone interrupted you to ask what song had just finished playing, you would probably be unable to
answer that question.
LINK T O LEARNING
See for yourself how inattentional blindness works by checking out this selective attention test
(http://openstax.org/l/blindness) from Simons and Chabris (1999).
One of the most interesting demonstrations of how important attention is in determining our perception of the
environment occurred in a famous study conducted by Daniel Simons and Christopher Chabris (1999). In this
study, participants watched a video of people dressed in black and white passing basketballs. Participants
were asked to count the number of times the team dressed in white passed the ball. During the video, a person
dressed in a black gorilla costume walks among the two teams. You would think that someone would notice the
gorilla, right? Nearly half of the people who watched the video didn’t notice the gorilla at all, despite the fact
that he was clearly visible for nine seconds. Because participants were so focused on the number of times the
team dressed in white was passing the ball, they completely tuned out other visual information. Inattentional
blindness is the failure to notice something that is completely visible because the person was actively
attending to something else and did not pay attention to other things (Mack & Rock, 1998; Simons & Chabris,
1999).
In a similar experiment, researchers tested inattentional blindness by asking participants to observe images
moving across a computer screen. They were instructed to focus on either white or black objects, disregarding
the other color. When a red cross passed across the screen, about one third of subjects did not notice it (Figure
5.3) (Most, Simons, Scholl, & Chabris, 2000).
FIGURE 5.3 Nearly one third of participants in a study did not notice that a red cross passed on the screen because
their attention was focused on the black or white figures. (credit: Cory Zanker)
Motivation can also affect perception. Have you ever been expecting a really important phone call and, while
taking a shower, you think you hear the phone ringing, only to discover that it is not? If so, then you have
experienced how motivation to detect a meaningful stimulus can shift our ability to discriminate between a
true sensory stimulus and background noise. The ability to identify a stimulus when it is embedded in a
distracting background is called signal detection theory. This might also explain why a mother is awakened
by a quiet murmur from her baby but not by other sounds that occur while she is asleep. Signal detection
theory has practical applications, such as increasing air traffic controller accuracy. Controllers need to be able
to detect planes among many signals (blips) that appear on the radar screen and follow those planes as they
move through the sky. In fact, the original work of the researcher who developed signal detection theory was
focused on improving the sensitivity of air traffic controllers to plane blips (Swets, 1964).

Our perceptions can also be affected by our beliefs, values, prejudices, expectations, and life experiences. As
you will see later in this chapter, individuals who are deprived of the experience of binocular vision during
critical periods of development have trouble perceiving depth (Fawcett, Wang, & Birch, 2005). The shared
experiences of people within a given cultural context can have pronounced effects on perception. For example,
Marshall Segall, Donald Campbell, and Melville Herskovits (1963) published the results of a multinational
study in which they demonstrated that individuals from Western cultures were more prone to experience
certain types of visual illusions than individuals from non-Western cultures, and vice versa. One such illusion
that Westerners were more likely to experience was the Müller-Lyer illusion (Figure 5.4): The lines appear to be
different lengths, but they are actually the same length.
FIGURE 5.4 In the Müller-Lyer illusion, lines appear to be different lengths although they are identical. (a) Arrows at
the ends of lines may make the line on the right appear longer, although the lines are the same length. (b) When
applied to a three-dimensional image, the line on the right again may appear longer although both black lines are
the same length.
These perceptual differences were consistent with differences in the types of environmental features
experienced on a regular basis by people in a given cultural context. People in Western cultures, for example,
have a perceptual context of buildings with straight lines, what Segall’s study called a carpentered world (Segall
et al., 1966). In contrast, people from certain non-Western cultures with an uncarpentered view, such as the
Zulu of South Africa, whose villages are made up of round huts arranged in circles, are less susceptible to this
illusion (Segall et al., 1999). It is not just vision that is affected by cultural factors. Indeed, research has
demonstrated that the ability to identify an odor, and rate its pleasantness and its intensity, varies cross-
culturally (Ayabe-Kanamura, Saito, Distel, Martínez-Gómez, & Hudson, 1998).
Children described as thrill seekers are more likely to show taste preferences for intense sour flavors (Liem,
Westerbeek, Wolterink, Kok, & de Graaf, 2004), which suggests that basic aspects of personality might affect
perception. Furthermore, individuals who hold positive attitudes toward reduced-fat foods are more likely to
rate foods labeled as reduced fat as tasting better than people who have less positive attitudes about these
products (Aaron, Mela, & Evans, 1994).
5.2 Waves and Wavelengths
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe important physical features of wave forms
• Show how physical properties of light waves are associated with perceptual experience
• Show how physical properties of sound waves are associated with perceptual experience
Visual and auditory stimuli both occur in the form of waves. Although the two stimuli are very different in
terms of composition, wave forms share similar characteristics that are especially important to our visual and
5.2 • Waves and Wavelengths 149
auditory perceptions. In this section, we describe the physical properties of the waves as well as the perceptual
experiences associated with them.
Amplitude and Wavelength
Two physical characteristics of a wave are amplitude and wavelength (Figure 5.5). The amplitude of a wave is
the distance from the center line to the top point of the crest or the bottom point of the trough. Wavelength
refers to the length of a wave from one peak to the next.
FIGURE 5.5 The amplitude or height of a wave is measured from the peak to the trough. The wavelength is
measured from peak to peak.
Wavelength is directly related to the frequency of a given wave form. Frequency refers to the number of waves
that pass a given point in a given time period and is often expressed in terms of hertz (Hz), or cycles per
second. Longer wavelengths will have lower frequencies, and shorter wavelengths will have higher frequencies
(Figure 5.6).
FIGURE 5.6 This figure illustrates waves of differing wavelengths/frequencies. At the top of the figure, the red wave
has a long wavelength/short frequency. Moving from top to bottom, the wavelengths decrease and frequencies
increase.
Light Waves
The visible spectrum is the portion of the larger electromagnetic spectrum that we can see. As Figure 5.7
shows, the electromagnetic spectrum encompasses all of the electromagnetic radiation that occurs in our
environment and includes gamma rays, x-rays, ultraviolet light, visible light, infrared light, microwaves, and
radio waves. The visible spectrum in humans is associated with wavelengths that range from 380 to 740 nm—a
very small distance, since a nanometer (nm) is one billionth of a meter. Other species can detect other portions
of the electromagnetic spectrum. For instance, honeybees can see light in the ultraviolet range (Wakakuwa,
Stavenga, & Arikawa, 2007), and some snakes can detect infrared radiation in addition to more traditional
visual light cues (Chen, Deng, Brauth, Ding, & Tang, 2012; Hartline, Kass, & Loop, 1978).

The chapter then turns to the study of vision, hearing, and the other senses, including touch and smell. Finally, the chapter discusses the principles of perception and how they can be applied to our everyday lives. Sensory Systems The nervous system is a complex network of nerve cells (neurons) that transmit and receive information from the outside world, such as light, sound, touch, smell, taste, sight, etc. These neurons are organized into different types of neurons, each with its own specific function. For example, there are sensory neurons that receive information from our sense organs (eyes, ears) and transmit that information to other parts of our nervous system. There are also motor neurons (nerve cells that send signals to muscles to cause them to contract or relax), which are responsible for controlling the movement of muscles in response to signals received from other neurons. The sensory system receives and processes information in a variety of ways, depending on the type of input that is being received. Sensory information can come in many different forms. Some of these forms include visual, auditory, olfactory (smell), gustatory (taste), tactile (touch), and proprioceptive (body position and movement) information. Each sensory type has a unique way of processing and interpreting the information it receives, which is referred to as its “type of sensation”. Types of Sensations There are two main categories of sensations: physical sensations and emotional sensations. Physical sensations are those that involve the body’s internal organs and systems. Examples of physical sensory types include pain, temperature, pressure, vibration, cold, heat, humidity, moisture, motion, gravity, vision, sight, audition (hearing), olfaction (嗅觉), taste (salty, sweet, sour, bitter, umami), touch (warm, cool, rough, smooth), and proprioception (position, movement, balance). Emotional sensations refer to feelings and emotions that arise from interactions with the external world. Examples of emotional types include fear, anxiety, anger, sadness, happiness, joy, surprise, excitement, disgust, disgust, shame, guilt, embarrassment, pride, contempt, fear of death, love, hate, jealousy, envy, sympathy, compassion, gratitude, awe, wonder, curiosity,","{""sections"": [""Sensation and Perception/Vision""], ""pages"": [""158"", ""159"", ""160""]}"

5.6 Gestalt Principles of Perception
Imagine standing on a city street corner. You might be struck by movement everywhere as
cars and people go about their business, by the sound of a street musician’s melody or a horn honking in the
distance, by the smell of exhaust fumes or of food being sold by a nearby vendor, and by the sensation of hard
pavement under your feet.
We rely on our sensory systems to provide important information about our surroundings. We use this
information to successfully navigate and interact with our environment so that we can find nourishment, seek
shelter, maintain social relationships, and avoid potentially dangerous situations.
This chapter will provide an overview of how sensory information is received and processed by the nervous
system and how that affects our conscious experience of the world. We begin by learning the distinction
between sensation and perception. Then we consider the physical properties of light and sound stimuli, along
with an overview of the basic structure and function of the major sensory systems. The chapter will close with
a discussion of a historically important theory of perception called Gestalt.
5Sensation and Perception
5.1 Sensation versus Perception
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Distinguish between sensation and perception
• Describe the concepts of absolute threshold and difference threshold
• Discuss the roles attention, motivation, and sensory adaptation play in perception
Sensation
What does it mean to sense something? Sensory receptors are specialized neurons that respond to specific
types of stimuli. When sensory information is detected by a sensory receptor, sensation has occurred. For
example, light that enters the eye causes chemical changes in cells that line the back of the eye. These cells
relay messages, in the form of action potentials (as you learned when studying biopsychology), to the central
nervous system. The conversion from sensory stimulus energy to action potential is known as transduction.
You have probably known since elementary school that we have five senses: vision, hearing (audition), smell
(olfaction), taste (gustation), and touch (somatosensation). It turns out that this notion of five senses is
oversimplified. We also have sensory systems that provide information about balance (the vestibular sense),
body position and movement (proprioception and kinesthesia), pain (nociception), and temperature
(thermoception).
The sensitivity of a given sensory system to the relevant stimuli can be expressed as an absolute threshold.
Absolute threshold refers to the minimum amount of stimulus energy that must be present for the stimulus to
be detected 50% of the time. Another way to think about this is by asking how dim can a light be or how soft
can a sound be and still be detected half of the time. The sensitivity of our sensory receptors can be quite
amazing. It has been estimated that on a clear night, the most sensitive sensory cells in the back of the eye can
detect a candle flame 30 miles away (Okawa & Sampath, 2007). Under quiet conditions, the hair cells (the
receptor cells of the inner ear) can detect the tick of a clock 20 feet away (Galanter, 1962).
It is also possible for us to get messages that are presented below the threshold for conscious awareness—these
are called subliminal messages. A stimulus reaches a physiological threshold when it is strong enough to
excite sensory receptors and send nerve impulses to the brain: This is an absolute threshold. A message below
that threshold is said to be subliminal: We receive it, but we are not consciously aware of it. Over the years
there has been a great deal of speculation about the use of subliminal messages in advertising, rock music, and
self-help audio programs. Research evidence shows that in laboratory settings, people can process and
respond to information outside of awareness. But this does not mean that we obey these messages like
zombies; in fact, hidden messages have little effect on behavior outside the laboratory (Kunst-Wilson & Zajonc,
1980; Rensink, 2004; Nelson, 2008; Radel, Sarrazin, Legrain, & Gobancé, 2009; Loersch, Durso, & Petty, 2013).
Absolute thresholds are generally measured under incredibly controlled conditions in situations that are
optimal for sensitivity. Sometimes, we are more interested in how much difference in stimuli is required to
detect a difference between them. This is known as the just noticeable difference (jnd) or difference
threshold. Unlike the absolute threshold, the difference threshold changes depending on the stimulus
intensity. As an example, imagine yourself in a very dark movie theater. If an audience member were to receive
a text message that caused the cell phone screen to light up, chances are that many people would notice the
change in illumination in the theater. However, if the same thing happened in a brightly lit arena during a
basketball game, very few people would notice. The cell phone brightness does not change, but its ability to be
detected as a change in illumination varies dramatically between the two contexts. Ernst Weber proposed this
theory of change in difference threshold in the 1830s, and it has become known as Weber’s law: The difference
threshold is a constant fraction of the original stimulus, as the example illustrates.

Perception
While our sensory receptors are constantly collecting information from the environment, it is ultimately how
we interpret that information that affects how we interact with the world. Perception refers to the way sensory
information is organized, interpreted, and consciously experienced. Perception involves both bottom-up and
top-down processing. Bottom-up processing refers to sensory information from a stimulus in the
environment driving a process, and top-down processing refers to knowledge and expectancy driving a
process, as shown in Figure 5.2 (Egeth & Yantis, 1997; Fine & Minnery, 2009; Yantis & Egeth, 1999).
FIGURE 5.2 Top-down and bottom-up are ways we process our perceptions.
Imagine that you and some friends are sitting in a crowded restaurant eating lunch and talking. It is very noisy,
and you are concentrating on your friend’s face to hear what they are saying, then the sound of breaking glass
and clang of metal pans hitting the floor rings out. The server dropped a large tray of food. Although you were
attending to your meal and conversation, that crashing sound would likely get through your attentional filters
and capture your attention. You would have no choice but to notice it. That attentional capture would be caused
by the sound from the environment: it would be bottom-up.
Alternatively, top-down processes are generally goal directed, slow, deliberate, effortful, and under your
control (Fine & Minnery, 2009; Miller & Cohen, 2001; Miller & D'Esposito, 2005). For instance, if you misplaced
your keys, how would you look for them? If you had a yellow key fob, you would probably look for yellowness of
a certain size in specific locations, such as on the counter, coffee table, and other similar places. You would not
look for yellowness on your ceiling fan, because you know keys are not normally lying on top of a ceiling fan.
That act of searching for a certain size of yellowness in some locations and not others would be top-
down—under your control and based on your experience.
One way to think of this concept is that sensation is a physical process, whereas perception is psychological.
For example, upon walking into a kitchen and smelling the scent of baking cinnamon rolls, the sensation is the
scent receptors detecting the odor of cinnamon, but the perception may be “Mmm, this smells like the bread
Grandma used to bake when the family gathered for holidays.”
Although our perceptions are built from sensations, not all sensations result in perception. In fact, we often
don’t perceive stimuli that remain relatively constant over prolonged periods of time. This is known as
sensory adaptation. Imagine going to a city that you have never visited. You check in to the hotel, but when
you get to your room, there is a road construction sign with a bright flashing light outside your window.
Unfortunately, there are no other rooms available, so you are stuck with a flashing light. You decide to watch
television to unwind. The flashing light was extremely annoying when you first entered your room. It was as if
someone was continually turning a bright yellow spotlight on and off in your room, but after watching
television for a short while, you no longer notice the light flashing. The light is still flashing and filling your
room with yellow light every few seconds, and the photoreceptors in your eyes still sense the light, but you no
longer perceive the rapid changes in lighting conditions. That you no longer perceive the flashing light
demonstrates sensory adaptation and shows that while closely associated, sensation and perception are
different.
5.1 • Sensation versus Perception 147
There is another factor that affects sensation and perception: attention. Attention plays a significant role in
determining what is sensed versus what is perceived. Imagine you are at a party full of music, chatter, and
laughter. You get involved in an interesting conversation with a friend, and you tune out all the background
noise. If someone interrupted you to ask what song had just finished playing, you would probably be unable to
answer that question.
LINK T O LEARNING
See for yourself how inattentional blindness works by checking out this selective attention test
(http://openstax.org/l/blindness) from Simons and Chabris (1999).
One of the most interesting demonstrations of how important attention is in determining our perception of the
environment occurred in a famous study conducted by Daniel Simons and Christopher Chabris (1999). In this
study, participants watched a video of people dressed in black and white passing basketballs. Participants
were asked to count the number of times the team dressed in white passed the ball. During the video, a person
dressed in a black gorilla costume walks among the two teams. You would think that someone would notice the
gorilla, right? Nearly half of the people who watched the video didn’t notice the gorilla at all, despite the fact
that he was clearly visible for nine seconds. Because participants were so focused on the number of times the
team dressed in white was passing the ball, they completely tuned out other visual information. Inattentional
blindness is the failure to notice something that is completely visible because the person was actively
attending to something else and did not pay attention to other things (Mack & Rock, 1998; Simons & Chabris,
1999).
In a similar experiment, researchers tested inattentional blindness by asking participants to observe images
moving across a computer screen. They were instructed to focus on either white or black objects, disregarding
the other color. When a red cross passed across the screen, about one third of subjects did not notice it (Figure
5.3) (Most, Simons, Scholl, & Chabris, 2000).
FIGURE 5.3 Nearly one third of participants in a study did not notice that a red cross passed on the screen because
their attention was focused on the black or white figures. (credit: Cory Zanker)
Motivation can also affect perception. Have you ever been expecting a really important phone call and, while
taking a shower, you think you hear the phone ringing, only to discover that it is not? If so, then you have
experienced how motivation to detect a meaningful stimulus can shift our ability to discriminate between a
true sensory stimulus and background noise. The ability to identify a stimulus when it is embedded in a
distracting background is called signal detection theory. This might also explain why a mother is awakened
by a quiet murmur from her baby but not by other sounds that occur while she is asleep. Signal detection
theory has practical applications, such as increasing air traffic controller accuracy. Controllers need to be able
to detect planes among many signals (blips) that appear on the radar screen and follow those planes as they
move through the sky. In fact, the original work of the researcher who developed signal detection theory was
focused on improving the sensitivity of air traffic controllers to plane blips (Swets, 1964).

Our perceptions can also be affected by our beliefs, values, prejudices, expectations, and life experiences. As
you will see later in this chapter, individuals who are deprived of the experience of binocular vision during
critical periods of development have trouble perceiving depth (Fawcett, Wang, & Birch, 2005). The shared
experiences of people within a given cultural context can have pronounced effects on perception. For example,
Marshall Segall, Donald Campbell, and Melville Herskovits (1963) published the results of a multinational
study in which they demonstrated that individuals from Western cultures were more prone to experience
certain types of visual illusions than individuals from non-Western cultures, and vice versa. One such illusion
that Westerners were more likely to experience was the Müller-Lyer illusion (Figure 5.4): The lines appear to be
different lengths, but they are actually the same length.
FIGURE 5.4 In the Müller-Lyer illusion, lines appear to be different lengths although they are identical. (a) Arrows at
the ends of lines may make the line on the right appear longer, although the lines are the same length. (b) When
applied to a three-dimensional image, the line on the right again may appear longer although both black lines are
the same length.
These perceptual differences were consistent with differences in the types of environmental features
experienced on a regular basis by people in a given cultural context. People in Western cultures, for example,
have a perceptual context of buildings with straight lines, what Segall’s study called a carpentered world (Segall
et al., 1966). In contrast, people from certain non-Western cultures with an uncarpentered view, such as the
Zulu of South Africa, whose villages are made up of round huts arranged in circles, are less susceptible to this
illusion (Segall et al., 1999). It is not just vision that is affected by cultural factors. Indeed, research has
demonstrated that the ability to identify an odor, and rate its pleasantness and its intensity, varies cross-
culturally (Ayabe-Kanamura, Saito, Distel, Martínez-Gómez, & Hudson, 1998).
Children described as thrill seekers are more likely to show taste preferences for intense sour flavors (Liem,
Westerbeek, Wolterink, Kok, & de Graaf, 2004), which suggests that basic aspects of personality might affect
perception. Furthermore, individuals who hold positive attitudes toward reduced-fat foods are more likely to
rate foods labeled as reduced fat as tasting better than people who have less positive attitudes about these
products (Aaron, Mela, & Evans, 1994).

Summary
5.1 Sensation versus Perception
Sensation occurs when sensory receptors detect sensory stimuli. Perception involves the organization,
interpretation, and conscious experience of those sensations. All sensory systems have both absolute and
difference thresholds, which refer to the minimum amount of stimulus energy or the minimum amount of
difference in stimulus energy required to be detected about 50% of the time, respectively. Sensory adaptation,
selective attention, and signal detection theory can help explain what is perceived and what is not. In addition,
our perceptions are affected by a number of factors, including beliefs, values, prejudices, culture, and life
experiences.
5.2 Waves and Wavelengths
Both light and sound can be described in terms of wave forms with physical characteristics like amplitude,
wavelength, and timbre. Wavelength and frequency are inversely related so that longer waves have lower
frequencies, and shorter waves have higher frequencies. In the visual system, a light wave’s wavelength is
generally associated with color, and its amplitude is associated with brightness. In the auditory system, a
sound’s frequency is associated with pitch, and its amplitude is associated with loudness.
5.3 Vision
Light waves cross the cornea and enter the eye at the pupil. The eye’s lens focuses this light so that the image is
focused on a region of the retina known as the fovea. The fovea contains cones that possess high levels of
visual acuity and operate best in bright light conditions. Rods are located throughout the retina and operate
best under dim light conditions. Visual information leaves the eye via the optic nerve. Information from each
visual field is sent to the opposite side of the brain at the optic chiasm. Visual information then moves through
a number of brain sites before reaching the occipital lobe, where it is processed.
Two theories explain color perception. The trichromatic theory asserts that three distinct cone groups are
tuned to slightly different wavelengths of light, and it is the combination of activity across these cone types that
results in our perception of all the colors we see. The opponent-process theory of color vision asserts that color
is processed in opponent pairs and accounts for the interesting phenomenon of a negative afterimage. We
perceive depth through a combination of monocular and binocular depth cues.
5.4 Hearing
Sound waves are funneled into the auditory canal and cause vibrations of the eardrum; these vibrations move
the ossicles. As the ossicles move, the stapes presses against the oval window of the cochlea, which causes fluid
inside the cochlea to move. As a result, hair cells embedded in the basilar membrane become enlarged, which
sends neural impulses to the brain via the auditory nerve.
Pitch perception and sound localization are important aspects of hearing. Our ability to perceive pitch relies
on both the firing rate of the hair cells in the basilar membrane as well as their location within the membrane.
In terms of sound localization, both monaural and binaural cues are used to locate where sounds originate in
our environment.
Individuals can be born deaf, or they can develop deafness as a result of age, genetic predisposition, and/or
environmental causes. Hearing loss that results from a failure of the vibration of the eardrum or the resultant
movement of the ossicles is called conductive hearing loss. Hearing loss that involves a failure of the
174 5 • Summary

transmission of auditory nerve impulses to the brain is called sensorineural hearing loss.
5.5 The Other Senses
Taste (gustation) and smell (olfaction) are chemical senses that employ receptors on the tongue and in the
nose that bind directly with taste and odor molecules in order to transmit information to the brain for
processing. Our ability to perceive touch, temperature, and pain is mediated by a number of receptors and free
nerve endings that are distributed throughout the skin and various tissues of the body. The vestibular sense
helps us maintain a sense of balance through the response of hair cells in the utricle, saccule, and semi-
circular canals that respond to changes in head position and gravity. Our proprioceptive and kinesthetic
systems provide information about body position and body movement through receptors that detect stretch
and tension in the muscles, joints, tendons, and skin of the body.
5.6 Gestalt Principles of Perception
Gestalt theorists have been incredibly influential in the areas of sensation and perception. Gestalt principles
such as figure-ground relationship, grouping by proximity or similarity, the law of good continuation, and
closure are all used to help explain how we organize sensory information. Our perceptions are not infallible,
and they can be influenced by bias, prejudice, and other factors.

You might be struck by movement everywhere as cars and people go about their business, by the sound of a street musician’s melody or a horn honking in the distance, by the smell of exhaust fumes or of food being sold by a nearby vendor, and by the sensation of hard pavement under your feet. We rely on our sensory systems to provide important information about our surroundings. We use this information to successfully navigate and interact with our environment so that we can find nourishment, seek shelter, maintain social relationships, and avoid potentially dangerous situations. This chapter will provide an overview of how sensory information is received and processed by the nervous system and how that affects our conscious experience of the world. We begin by learning the distinction between sensation and perception. Next, we explore the properties of light and sound waves, as well as how they are perceived by our eyes and ears, respectively. The chapter then turns to the study of vision, hearing, and the other senses, including touch and smell. Finally, the chapter discusses the principles of perception and how they can be applied to our everyday lives. Sensory Systems The nervous system is a complex network of nerve cells (neurons) that transmit and receive information from the outside world, such as light, sound, touch, smell, taste, sight, etc. These neurons are organized into different types of neurons, each with its own specific function. For example, there are sensory neurons that receive information from our sense organs (eyes, ears) and transmit that information to other parts of our nervous system. There are also motor neurons (nerve cells that send signals to muscles to cause them to contract or relax), which are responsible for controlling the movement of muscles in response to signals received from other neurons. The sensory system receives and processes information in a variety of ways, depending on the type of input that is being received. Sensory information can come in many different forms. Some of these forms include visual, auditory, olfactory (smell), gustatory (taste), tactile (touch), and proprioceptive (body position and movement) information. Each sensory type has a unique way of processing and interpreting the information it receives, which is referred to as its “type of sensation”. Types of Sensations There are two main categories of sensations: physical sensations and emotional sensations. Physical sensations are those that involve the body’s internal organs and systems. Examples of physical sensory types include pain, temperature, pressure, vibration, cold, heat, humidity, moisture, motion, gravity, vision, sight, audition (hearing), olfaction (嗅觉), taste (salty, sweet, sour, bitter, umami), touch (warm, cool, rough, smooth), and proprioception (position, movement, balance). Emotional sensations refer to feelings and emotions that arise from interactions with the external world. Examples of emotional types include fear, anxiety, anger, sadness, happiness, joy, surprise, excitement, disgust, disgust, shame, guilt, embarrassment, pride, contempt, fear of death, love, hate, jealousy, envy, sympathy, compassion, gratitude, awe, wonder, curiosity,","{""sections"": [""Sensation and Perception/Vision"", ""Learning/Classical Conditioning""], ""pages"": [""158"", ""159"", ""186""]}"

neurodevelopment, plasticity of the nervous system, and biological correlates of psychological disorders.
Given the broad areas of interest falling under the purview of biological psychology, it will probably come as no
surprise that individuals from all sorts of backgrounds are involved in this research, including biologists,
medical professionals, physiologists, and chemists. This interdisciplinary approach is often referred to as
neuroscience, of which biological psychology is a component (Carlson, 2013).
While biopsychology typically focuses on the immediate causes of behavior based in the physiology of a
human or other animal, evolutionary psychology seeks to study the ultimate biological causes of behavior. To
the extent that a behavior is impacted by genetics, a behavior, like any anatomical characteristic of a human or
animal, will demonstrate adaption to its surroundings. These surroundings include the physical environment
and, since interactions between organisms can be important to survival and reproduction, the social
environment. The study of behavior in the context of evolution has its origins with Charles Darwin, the co-
discoverer of the theory of evolution by natural selection. Darwin was well aware that behaviors should be
adaptive and wrote books titled, The Descent of Man (1871) and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and
Animals (1872), to explore this field.
Evolutionary psychology, and specifically, the evolutionary psychology of humans, has enjoyed a resurgence in
recent decades. To be subject to evolution by natural selection, a behavior must have a significant genetic
cause. In general, we expect all human cultures to express a behavior if it is caused genetically, since the
genetic differences among human groups are small. The approach taken by most evolutionary psychologists is
to predict the outcome of a behavior in a particular situation based on evolutionary theory and then to make
observations, or conduct experiments, to determine whether the results match the theory. It is important to
recognize that these types of studies are not strong evidence that a behavior is adaptive, since they lack
information that the behavior is in some part genetic and not entirely cultural (Endler, 1986). Demonstrating
that a trait, especially in humans, is naturally selected is extraordinarily difficult; perhaps for this reason,
some evolutionary psychologists are content to assume the behaviors they study have genetic determinants
(Confer et al., 2010).
One other drawback of evolutionary psychology is that the traits that we possess now evolved under
environmental and social conditions far back in human history, and we have a poor understanding of what
these conditions were. This makes predictions about what is adaptive for a behavior difficult. Behavioral traits
need not be adaptive under current conditions, only under the conditions of the past when they evolved, about
which we can only hypothesize.
There are many areas of human behavior for which evolution can make predictions. Examples include
memory, mate choice, relationships between kin, friendship and cooperation, parenting, social organization,
and status (Confer et al., 2010).
Evolutionary psychologists have had success in finding experimental correspondence between observations
and expectations. In one example, in a study of mate preference differences between men and women that
spanned 37 cultures, Buss (1989) found that women valued earning potential factors greater than men, and
men valued potential reproductive factors (youth and attractiveness) greater than women in their prospective
mates. In general, the predictions were in line with the predictions of evolution, although there were deviations
in some cultures.
Sensation and Perception
Scientists interested in both physiological aspects of sensory systems as well as in the psychological
experience of sensory information work within the area of sensation and perception (Figure 1.11). As such,
sensation and perception research is also quite interdisciplinary. Imagine walking between buildings as you
move from one class to another. You are inundated with sights, sounds, touch sensations, and smells. You also
experience the temperature of the air around you and maintain your balance as you make your way. These are

all factors of interest to someone working in the domain of sensation and perception.
FIGURE 1.11 When you look at this image, you may see a duck or a rabbit. The sensory information remains the
same, but your perception can vary dramatically.
As described in a later chapter that focuses on the results of studies in sensation and perception, our
experience of our world is not as simple as the sum total of all of the sensory information (or sensations)
together. Rather, our experience (or perception) is complex and is influenced by where we focus our attention,
our previous experiences, and even our cultural backgrounds.
Cognitive Psychology
As mentioned in the previous section, the cognitive revolution created an impetus for psychologists to focus
their attention on better understanding the mind and mental processes that underlie behavior. Thus, cognitive
psychology is the area of psychology that focuses on studying cognitions, or thoughts, and their relationship to
our experiences and our actions. Like biological psychology, cognitive psychology is broad in its scope and
often involves collaborations among people from a diverse range of disciplinary backgrounds. This has led
some to coin the term cognitive science to describe the interdisciplinary nature of this area of research (Miller,
2003).
Cognitive psychologists have research interests that span a spectrum of topics, ranging from attention to
problem solving to language to memory. The approaches used in studying these topics are equally diverse.
Given such diversity, cognitive psychology is not captured in one chapter of this text per se; rather, various
concepts related to cognitive psychology will be covered in relevant portions of the chapters in this text on
sensation and perception, thinking and intelligence, memory, lifespan development, social psychology, and
therapy.
Developmental Psychology
Developmental psychology is the scientific study of development across a lifespan. Developmental
psychologists are interested in processes related to physical maturation. However, their focus is not limited to
the physical changes associated with aging, as they also focus on changes in cognitive skills, moral reasoning,
social behavior, and other psychological attributes.
Early developmental psychologists focused primarily on changes that occurred through reaching adulthood,
providing enormous insight into the differences in physical, cognitive, and social capacities that exist between
very young children and adults. For instance, research by Jean Piaget (Figure 1.12) demonstrated that very
young children do not demonstrate object permanence. Object permanence refers to the understanding that
physical things continue to exist, even if they are hidden from us. If you were to show an adult a toy, and then
hide it behind a curtain, the adult knows that the toy still exists. However, very young infants act as if a hidden
object no longer exists. The age at which object permanence is achieved is somewhat controversial (Munakata,
McClelland, Johnson, and Siegler, 1997).
1.3 • Contemporary Psychology 21
FIGURE 1.12 Jean Piaget is famous for his theories regarding changes in cognitive ability that occur as we move
from infancy to adulthood.
While Piaget was focused on cognitive changes during infancy and childhood as we move to adulthood, there is
an increasing interest in extending research into the changes that occur much later in life. This may be
reflective of changing population demographics of developed nations as a whole. As more and more people live
longer lives, the number of people of advanced age will continue to increase. Indeed, it is estimated that there
were just over 40 million people aged 65 or older living in the United States in 2010. However, by 2020, this
number is expected to increase to about 55 million. By the year 2050, it is estimated that nearly 90 million
people in this country will be 65 or older (Department of Health and Human Services, n.d.).
Personality Psychology
Personality psychology focuses on patterns of thoughts and behaviors that make each individual unique.
Several individuals (e.g., Freud and Maslow) that we have already discussed in our historical overview of
psychology, and the American psychologist Gordon Allport, contributed to early theories of personality. These
early theorists attempted to explain how an individual’s personality develops from their given perspective. For
example, Freud proposed that personality arose as conflicts between the conscious and unconscious parts of
the mind were carried out over the lifespan. Specifically, Freud theorized that an individual went through
various psychosexual stages of development. According to Freud, adult personality would result from the
resolution of various conflicts that centered on the migration of erogenous (or sexual pleasure-producing)
zones from the oral (mouth) to the anus to the phallus to the genitals. Like many of Freud’s theories, this
particular idea was controversial and did not lend itself to experimental tests (Person, 1980).
More recently, the study of personality has taken on a more quantitative approach. Rather than explaining how
personality arises, research is focused on identifying personality traits, measuring these traits, and
determining how these traits interact in a particular context to determine how a person will behave in any
given situation. Personality traits are relatively consistent patterns of thought and behavior, and many have
proposed that five trait dimensions are sufficient to capture the variations in personality seen across
individuals. These five dimensions are known as the “Big Five” or the Five Factor model, and include
dimensions of conscientiousness, agreeableness, neuroticism, openness, and extraversion (Figure 1.13). Each
of these traits has been demonstrated to be relatively stable over the lifespan (e.g., Rantanen, Metsäpelto, Feldt,
Pulkinnen, and Kokko, 2007; Soldz & Vaillant, 1999; McCrae & Costa, 2008) and is influenced by genetics (e.g.,
Jang, Livesly, and Vernon, 1996).

FIGURE 1.13 Each of the dimensions of the Five Factor model is shown in this figure. The provided description
would describe someone who scored highly on that given dimension. Someone with a lower score on a given
dimension could be described in opposite terms.
Social Psychology
Social psychology focuses on how we interact with and relate to others. Social psychologists conduct research
on a wide variety of topics that include differences in how we explain our own behavior versus how we explain
the behaviors of others, prejudice, and attraction, and how we resolve interpersonal conflicts. Social
psychologists have also sought to determine how being among other people changes our own behavior and
patterns of thinking.
There are many interesting examples of social psychological research, and you will read about many of these
in a later chapter of this textbook. Until then, you will be introduced to one of the most controversial
psychological studies ever conducted. Stanley Milgram was an American social psychologist who is most
famous for research that he conducted on obedience. After the holocaust, in 1961, a Nazi war criminal, Adolf
Eichmann, who was accused of committing mass atrocities, was put on trial. Many people wondered how
German soldiers were capable of torturing prisoners in concentration camps, and they were unsatisfied with
the excuses given by soldiers that they were simply following orders. At the time, most psychologists agreed
that few people would be willing to inflict such extraordinary pain and suffering, simply because they were
obeying orders. Milgram decided to conduct research to determine whether or not this was true (Figure 1.14).
As you will read later in the text, Milgram found that nearly two-thirds of his participants were willing to
deliver what they believed to be lethal shocks to another person, simply because they were instructed to do so
by an authority figure (in this case, a man dressed in a lab coat). This was in spite of the fact that participants
1.3 • Contemporary Psychology 23
received payment for simply showing up for the research study and could have chosen not to inflict pain or
more serious consequences on another person by withdrawing from the study. No one was actually hurt or
harmed in any way, Milgram’s experiment was a clever ruse that took advantage of research confederates,
those who pretend to be participants in a research study who are actually working for the researcher and have
clear, specific directions on how to behave during the research study (Hock, 2009). Milgram’s and others’
studies that involved deception and potential emotional harm to study participants catalyzed the development
of ethical guidelines for conducting psychological research that discourage the use of deception of research
subjects, unless it can be argued not to cause harm and, in general, requiring informed consent of
participants.
FIGURE 1.14 Stanley Milgram’s research demonstrated just how far people will go in obeying orders from an
authority figure. This advertisement was used to recruit subjects for his research.
Industrial-Organizational Psychology
Industrial-Organizational psychology (I-O psychology) is a subfield of psychology that applies psychological
theories, principles, and research findings in industrial and organizational settings. I-O psychologists are often
involved in issues related to personnel management, organizational structure, and workplace environment.
Businesses often seek the aid of I-O psychologists to make the best hiring decisions as well as to create an
environment that results in high levels of employee productivity and efficiency. In addition to its applied
nature, I-O psychology also involves conducting scientific research on behavior within I-O settings (Riggio,
2013).

that personality is shaped, in some part, by experiences we have in childhood. These stages are discussed in
detail in the chapter on personality.
Psychosocial Theory of Development
Erik Erikson (1902–1994) (Figure 9.4), another stage theorist, took Freud’s theory and modified it as
psychosocial theory. Erikson’s psychosocial development theory emphasizes the social nature of our
development rather than its sexual nature. While Freud believed that personality is shaped only in childhood,
Erikson proposed that personality development takes place all through the lifespan. Erikson suggested that
how we interact with others is what affects our sense of self, or what he called the ego identity.
FIGURE 9.4 Erik Erikson proposed the psychosocial theory of development. In each stage of Erikson’s theory, there
is a psychosocial task that we must master in order to feel a sense of competence.
Erikson proposed that we are motivated by a need to achieve competence in certain areas of our lives.
According to psychosocial theory, we experience eight stages of development over our lifespan, from infancy
through late adulthood. At each stage there is a conflict, or task, that we need to resolve. Successful completion
of each developmental task results in a sense of competence and a healthy personality. Failure to master these
tasks leads to feelings of inadequacy.
According to Erikson (1963), trust is the basis of our development during infancy (birth to 12 months).
Therefore, the primary task of this stage is trust versus mistrust. Infants are dependent upon their caregivers,
so caregivers who are responsive and sensitive to their infant’s needs help their baby to develop a sense of
trust; their baby will see the world as a safe, predictable place. Unresponsive caregivers who do not meet their
baby’s needs can engender feelings of anxiety, fear, and mistrust; their baby may see the world as
unpredictable.
As toddlers (ages 1–3 years) begin to explore their world, they learn that they can control their actions and act
on the environment to get results. They begin to show clear preferences for certain elements of the
environment, such as food, toys, and clothing. A toddler’s main task is to resolve the issue of autonomy versus
shame and doubt, by working to establish independence. This is the “me do it” stage. For example, we might
observe a budding sense of autonomy in a 2-year-old child who wants to choose her clothes and dress herself.
Although her outfits might not be appropriate for the situation, her input in such basic decisions has an effect
on her sense of independence. If denied the opportunity to act on her environment, she may begin to doubt her
abilities, which could lead to low self-esteem and feelings of shame.
Once children reach the preschool stage (ages 3–6 years), they are capable of initiating activities and asserting
control over their world through social interactions and play. According to Erikson, preschool children must
resolve the task of initiative versus guilt. By learning to plan and achieve goals while interacting with others,
preschool children can master this task. Those who do will develop self-confidence and feel a sense of purpose.
Those who are unsuccessful at this stage—with their initiative misfiring or stifled—may develop feelings of
guilt. How might over-controlling parents stifle a child’s initiative?
9.2 • Lifespan Theories 285
During the elementary school stage (ages 7–11), children face the task of industry versus inferiority. Children
begin to compare themselves to their peers to see how they measure up. They either develop a sense of pride
and accomplishment in their schoolwork, sports, social activities, and family life, or they feel inferior and
inadequate when they don’t measure up. What are some things parents and teachers can do to help children
develop a sense of competence and a belief in themselves and their abilities?
In adolescence (ages 12–18), children face the task of identity versus role confusion. According to Erikson, an
adolescent’s main task is developing a sense of self. Adolescents struggle with questions such as “Who am I?”
and “What do I want to do with my life?” Along the way, most adolescents try on many different selves to see
which ones fit. Adolescents who are successful at this stage have a strong sense of identity and are able to
remain true to their beliefs and values in the face of problems and other people’s perspectives. What happens
to apathetic adolescents, who do not make a conscious search for identity, or those who are pressured to
conform to their parents’ ideas for the future? These teens will have a weak sense of self and experience role
confusion. They are unsure of their identity and confused about the future.
People in early adulthood (i.e., 20s through early 40s) are concerned with intimacy versus isolation. After we
have developed a sense of self in adolescence, we are ready to share our life with others. Erikson said that we
must have a strong sense of self before developing intimate relationships with others. Adults who do not
develop a positive self-concept in adolescence may experience feelings of loneliness and emotional isolation.
When people reach their 40s, they enter the time known as middle adulthood, which extends to the mid-60s.
The social task of middle adulthood is generativity versus stagnation. Generativity involves finding your life’s
work and contributing to the development of others, through activities such as volunteering, mentoring, and
raising children. Those who do not master this task may experience stagnation, having little connection with
others and little interest in productivity and self-improvement.
From the mid-60s to the end of life, we are in the period of development known as late adulthood. Erikson’s
task at this stage is called integrity versus despair. He said that people in late adulthood reflect on their lives
and feel either a sense of satisfaction or a sense of failure. People who feel proud of their accomplishments feel
a sense of integrity, and they can look back on their lives with few regrets. However, people who are not
successful at this stage may feel as if their life has been wasted. They focus on what “would have,” “should
have,” and “could have” been. They face the end of their lives with feelings of bitterness, depression, and
despair. Table 9.1 summarizes the stages of Erikson’s theory.

TABLE 9.1
Cognitive Theory of Development
Jean Piaget (1896–1980) is another stage theorist who studied childhood development (Figure 9.5). Instead of
approaching development from a psychoanalytical or psychosocial perspective, Piaget focused on children’s
cognitive growth. He believed that thinking is a central aspect of development and that children are naturally
inquisitive. However, he said that children do not think and reason like adults (Piaget, 1930, 1932). His theory
of cognitive development holds that our cognitive abilities develop through specific stages, which exemplifies
the discontinuity approach to development. As we progress to a new stage, there is a distinct shift in how we
think and reason.
FIGURE 9.5 Jean Piaget spent over 50 years studying children and how their minds develop.
Piaget said that children develop schemata to help them understand the world. Schemata are concepts
(mental models) that are used to help us categorize and interpret information. By the time children have
reached adulthood, they have created schemata for almost everything. When children learn new information,
they adjust their schemata through two processes: assimilation and accommodation. First, they assimilate new
information or experiences in terms of their current schemata: assimilation is when they take in information
that is comparable to what they already know. Accommodation describes when they change their schemata
based on new information. This process continues as children interact with their environment.
For example, 2-year-old Abdul learned the schema for dogs because his family has a Labrador retriever. When
Abdul sees other dogs in his picture books, he says, “Look mommy, dog!” Thus, he has assimilated them into
9.2 • Lifespan Theories 287
his schema for dogs. One day, Abdul sees a sheep for the first time and says, “Look mommy, dog!” Having a
basic schema that a dog is an animal with four legs and fur, Abdul thinks all furry, four-legged creatures are
dogs. When Abdul’s mom tells him that the animal he sees is a sheep, not a dog, Abdul must accommodate his
schema for dogs to include more information based on his new experiences. Abdul’s schema for dog was too
broad, since not all furry, four-legged creatures are dogs. He now modifies his schema for dogs and forms a
new one for sheep.
Like Freud and Erikson, Piaget thought development unfolds in a series of stages approximately associated
with age ranges. He proposed a theory of cognitive development that unfolds in four stages: sensorimotor,
preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational (Table 9.2).

TABLE 9.2
The first stage is the sensorimotor stage, which lasts from birth to about 2 years old. During this stage,
children learn about the world through their senses and motor behavior. Young children put objects in their
mouths to see if the items are edible, and once they can grasp objects, they may shake or bang them to see if
they make sounds. Between 5 and 8 months old, the child develops object permanence, which is the
understanding that even if something is out of sight, it still exists (Bogartz, Shinskey, & Schilling, 2000).
According to Piaget, young infants do not remember an object after it has been removed from sight. Piaget
studied infants’ reactions when a toy was first shown to an infant and then hidden under a blanket. Infants
who had already developed object permanence would reach for the hidden toy, indicating that they knew it still
existed, whereas infants who had not developed object permanence would appear confused.

Please take a few minutes and view this brief video demonstrating different children's abilities to understand
object permanence (http://openstax.org/l/piaget) to learn more.
In Piaget’s view, around the same time children develop object permanence, they also begin to exhibit stranger
anxiety, which is a fear of unfamiliar people. Babies may demonstrate this by crying and turning away from a
stranger, by clinging to a caregiver, or by attempting to reach their arms toward familiar faces such as parents.
Stranger anxiety results when a child is unable to assimilate the stranger into an existing schema; therefore,
288 9 • Lifespan Development

she can’t predict what her experience with that stranger will be like, which results in a fear response.
Piaget’s second stage is the preoperational stage, which is from approximately 2 to 7 years old. In this stage,
children can use symbols to represent words, images, and ideas, which is why children in this stage engage in
pretend play. A child’s arms might become airplane wings as they zoom around the room, or a child with a
stick might become a brave knight with a sword. Children also begin to use language in the preoperational
stage, but they cannot understand adult logic or mentally manipulate information (the term operational refers
to logical manipulation of information, so children at this stage are considered to be pre-operational).
Children’s logic is based on their own personal knowledge of the world so far, rather than on conventional
knowledge. For example, dad gave a slice of pizza to 10-year-old Keiko and another slice to her 3-year-old
brother, Kenny. Kenny’s pizza slice was cut into five pieces, so Kenny told his sister that he got more pizza than
she did. Children in this stage cannot perform mental operations because they have not developed an
understanding of conservation, which is the idea that even if you change the appearance of something, it is
still equal in size as long as nothing has been removed or added.
LINK T O LEARNING
Watch this video of a boy in the preoperational stage responding to Piaget's conservation tasks
(http://openstax.org/l/piaget2) to learn more.
During this stage, we also expect children to display egocentrism, which means that the child is not able to
take the perspective of others. A child at this stage thinks that everyone sees, thinks, and feels just as they do.
Let’s look at Kenny and Keiko again. Keiko’s birthday is coming up, so their mom takes Kenny to the toy store to
choose a present for his sister. He selects an Iron Man action figure for her, thinking that if he likes the toy, his
sister will too. An egocentric child is not able to infer the perspective of other people and instead attributes his
own perspective.
LINK T O LEARNING
Piaget developed the Three-Mountain Task to determine the level of egocentrism displayed by children.
Children view a 3-dimensional mountain scene from one viewpoint, and are asked what another person at a
different viewpoint would see in the same scene. Watch this short video of the Three Mountain Task in action
(http://openstax.org/l/WonderYears) from the University of Minnesota and the Science Museum of Minnesota.
Piaget’s third stage is the concrete operational stage, which occurs from about 7 to 11 years old. In this stage,
children can think logically about real (concrete) events; they have a firm grasp on the use of numbers and
start to employ memory strategies. They can perform mathematical operations and understand
transformations, such as addition is the opposite of subtraction, and multiplication is the opposite of division.
In this stage, children also master the concept of conservation: Even if something changes shape, its mass,
volume, and number stay the same. For example, if you pour water from a tall, thin glass to a short, fat glass,
you still have the same amount of water. Remember Keiko and Kenny and the pizza? How did Keiko know that
Kenny was wrong when he said that he had more pizza?
Children in the concrete operational stage also understand the principle of reversibility, which means that
objects can be changed and then returned back to their original form or condition. Take, for example, water
that you poured into the short, fat glass: You can pour water from the fat glass back to the thin glass and still
have the same amount (minus a couple of drops).
The fourth, and last, stage in Piaget’s theory is the formal operational stage, which is from about age 11 to
adulthood. Whereas children in the concrete operational stage are able to think logically only about concrete
events, children in the formal operational stage can also deal with abstract ideas and hypothetical situations.
Children in this stage can use abstract thinking to problem solve, look at alternative solutions, and test these

studied by developmental psychologists. They view development as a lifelong process that can be studied
scientifically across three developmental domains: physical, cognitive development, and psychosocial. There
are several theories of development that focus on the following issues: whether development is continuous or
discontinuous, whether development follows one course or many, and the relative influence of nature versus
nurture on development.
9.2 Lifespan Theories
There are many theories regarding how babies and children grow and develop into happy, healthy adults.
Sigmund Freud suggested that we pass through a series of psychosexual stages in which our energy is focused
on certain erogenous zones on the body. Eric Erikson modified Freud’s ideas and suggested a theory of
psychosocial development. Erikson said that our social interactions and successful completion of social tasks
shape our sense of self. Jean Piaget proposed a theory of cognitive development that explains how children
think and reason as they move through various stages. Finally, Lawrence Kohlberg turned his attention to
moral development. He said that we pass through three levels of moral thinking that build on our cognitive
development.
9.3 Stages of Development
At conception the egg and sperm cell are united to form a zygote, which will begin to divide rapidly. This marks
the beginning of the first stage of prenatal development (germinal stage), which lasts about two weeks. Then
the zygote implants itself into the lining of the uterus, marking the beginning of the second stage of prenatal
development (embryonic stage), which lasts about six weeks. The embryo begins to develop body and organ
structures, and the neural tube forms, which will later become the brain and spinal cord. The third phase of
prenatal development (fetal stage) begins at 9 weeks and lasts until birth. The body, brain, and organs grow
rapidly during this stage. During all stages of pregnancy it is important that the parent receive prenatal care to
reduce health risks to themself and to the developing baby.
Newborn infants weigh about 7.5 pounds. Doctors assess a newborn’s reflexes, such as the sucking, rooting,
and Moro reflexes. Our physical, cognitive, and psychosocial skills grow and change as we move through
developmental stages from infancy through late adulthood. Attachment in infancy is a critical component of
healthy development. Parenting styles have been found to have an effect on childhood outcomes of well-being.
The transition from adolescence to adulthood can be challenging due to the timing of puberty, and due to the
extended amount of time spent in emerging adulthood. Although physical decline begins in middle adulthood,
cognitive decline does not begin until later. Activities that keep the body and mind active can help maintain
good physical and cognitive health as we age. Social supports through family and friends remain important as
we age.
9.4 Death and Dying
Death marks the endpoint of our lifespan. There are many ways that we might react when facing death. Kübler-
Ross developed a five-stage model of grief as a way to explain this process. Many people facing death choose
hospice care, which allows their last days to be spent at home in a comfortable, supportive environment.

Context: sensory and motor systems, sleep, drug use and abuse, ingestive behavior, reproductive behavior, neurodevelopment, plasticity of the nervous system, and biological correlates of psychological disorders. Given the broad areas of interest falling under the purview of biological psychology, it will probably come as no surprise that individuals from all sorts of backgrounds are involved in this research, including biologists, medical professionals, physiologists, and chemists. This interdisciplinary approach is often referred to as neuroscience, of which biological psychology is a component (Carlson, 2013). While biopsychology typically focuses on the immediate causes of behavior based in the physiology of a human or other animal, evolutionary psychology seeks to study the ultimate biological causes of behavior. To the extent that a behavior is impacted by genetics, a behavior, like any anatomical characteristic of a human or animal, will demonstrate adaption to its surroundings. These surroundings include the physical environment and, since interactions between organisms can be important to survival and reproduction, the social environment. The study of behavior in the context of evolution has its origins with Charles Darwin, the co- discoverer of the theory of evolution by natural selection. Darwin was well aware that behaviors should be adaptive and wrote books titled, The Descent of Man (1871) and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872), to explore this field. Evolutionary psychology, and specifically, the evolutionary psychology of humans, has enjoyed a resurgence in recent decades. To be subject to evolution by natural selection, a behavior must have a significant genetic cause. In general, we expect all human cultures to express a behavior if it is caused genetically, since the genetic differences among human groups are small. The approach taken by most evolutionary psychologists is to predict the outcome of a behavior in a particular situation based on evolutionary theory and then to make observations, or conduct experiments, to determine whether the results match the theory. It is important to recognize that these types of studies are not strong evidence that a behavior is adaptive, since they lack information that the behavior is in some part genetic and not entirely cultural (Endler, 1986). Demonstrating that a trait, especially one that has been shown to be adaptive in other species, is also found in humans is an important step toward understanding the adaptive nature of human behavior. In this chapter, you will learn about the basic concepts of behavioral genetics and evolutionary psychology. You will also be introduced to the field of neurobiology, which studies the brain and behavior in humans and other animals. Neurobiologists are interested in how the human brain works and how it responds to environmental stimuli, such as learning and memory. They also study how changes in brain structure and function can lead to neurological disorders. Finally, neuroscientists use brain imaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography (PET), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and electroencephalogram (EEG) to observe brain activity in response to different stimuli and to investigate the neural mechanisms that underlie learning, memory, attention, perception, emotion, motivation, decision-making, stress, anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, addiction, personality, aging, brain injury, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, autism, Tourette's syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), schizophrenia, alcoholism, eating disorders, sexual dysfunction, mood disorders (depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, etc.), and addiction (e.g., cocaine, amphetamines, opiates, marijuana, nicotine, heroin, methadone, cocaine, morphine, alprazolam, benzodiazepines, barbiturates), as well as how these disorders are diagnosed and treated. This chapter is divided into three sections. Section 3.1 provides an overview of basic principles of behavioral genetics. Specifically, this section covers the following topics: (a) the concept of heritability, (b) the role of genes and environment in determining the likelihood that an individual will exhibit certain behaviors and (c) how environmental factors can influence the expression of genetic traits. (Section 4.2) provides a brief introduction to evolutionary biology, with a focus on human evolution and the role that evolution has played in shaping our behavior and our understanding of ourselves as a species. Lastly, Section 5.3 discusses the neurobiological underpinnings of mental disorders and their relationship to behavioral disorders. Each of these sections is followed by a set of exercises that will help you apply the concepts discussed in that section to your own research.","{""sections"": [""Lifespan Development/Stages of Development"", ""Emotion and Motivation/Hunger and Eating"", ""Introduction to Psychology""], ""pages"": [""299"", ""329"", ""34""]}"

The Association for Psychological Science (APS) was founded in 1988 and seeks to advance the scientific
orientation of psychology. Its founding resulted from disagreements between members of the scientific and
clinical branches of psychology within the APA. The APS publishes five research journals and engages in
education and advocacy with funding agencies. A significant proportion of its members are international,
although the majority is located in the United States. Other organizations provide networking and
collaboration opportunities for professionals of several ethnic or racial groups working in psychology, such as
the National Latina/o Psychological Association (NLPA), the Asian American Psychological Association (AAPA),
the Association of Black Psychologists (ABPsi), and the Society of Indian Psychologists (SIP). Most of these
groups are also dedicated to studying psychological and social issues within their specific communities.
This section will provide an overview of the major subdivisions within psychology today in the order in which
they are introduced throughout the remainder of this textbook. This is not meant to be an exhaustive listing,
but it will provide insight into the major areas of research and practice of modern-day psychologists.

Biopsychology and Evolutionary Psychology
As the name suggests, biopsychology explores how our biology influences our behavior. While biological
psychology is a broad field, many biological psychologists want to understand how the structure and function
of the nervous system is related to behavior (Figure 1.10). As such, they often combine the research strategies
of both psychologists and physiologists to accomplish this goal (as discussed in Carlson, 2013).
FIGURE 1.10 Biological psychologists study how the structure and function of the nervous system generate
behavior.
The research interests of biological psychologists span a number of domains, including but not limited to,
1.3 • Contemporary Psychology 19
sensory and motor systems, sleep, drug use and abuse, ingestive behavior, reproductive behavior,
neurodevelopment, plasticity of the nervous system, and biological correlates of psychological disorders.
Given the broad areas of interest falling under the purview of biological psychology, it will probably come as no
surprise that individuals from all sorts of backgrounds are involved in this research, including biologists,
medical professionals, physiologists, and chemists. This interdisciplinary approach is often referred to as
neuroscience, of which biological psychology is a component (Carlson, 2013).
While biopsychology typically focuses on the immediate causes of behavior based in the physiology of a
human or other animal, evolutionary psychology seeks to study the ultimate biological causes of behavior. To
the extent that a behavior is impacted by genetics, a behavior, like any anatomical characteristic of a human or
animal, will demonstrate adaption to its surroundings. These surroundings include the physical environment
and, since interactions between organisms can be important to survival and reproduction, the social
environment. The study of behavior in the context of evolution has its origins with Charles Darwin, the co-
discoverer of the theory of evolution by natural selection. Darwin was well aware that behaviors should be
adaptive and wrote books titled, The Descent of Man (1871) and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and
Animals (1872), to explore this field.
Evolutionary psychology, and specifically, the evolutionary psychology of humans, has enjoyed a resurgence in
recent decades. To be subject to evolution by natural selection, a behavior must have a significant genetic
cause. In general, we expect all human cultures to express a behavior if it is caused genetically, since the
genetic differences among human groups are small. The approach taken by most evolutionary psychologists is
to predict the outcome of a behavior in a particular situation based on evolutionary theory and then to make
observations, or conduct experiments, to determine whether the results match the theory. It is important to
recognize that these types of studies are not strong evidence that a behavior is adaptive, since they lack
information that the behavior is in some part genetic and not entirely cultural (Endler, 1986). Demonstrating
that a trait, especially in humans, is naturally selected is extraordinarily difficult; perhaps for this reason,
some evolutionary psychologists are content to assume the behaviors they study have genetic determinants
(Confer et al., 2010).
One other drawback of evolutionary psychology is that the traits that we possess now evolved under
environmental and social conditions far back in human history, and we have a poor understanding of what
these conditions were. This makes predictions about what is adaptive for a behavior difficult. Behavioral traits
need not be adaptive under current conditions, only under the conditions of the past when they evolved, about
which we can only hypothesize.
There are many areas of human behavior for which evolution can make predictions. Examples include
memory, mate choice, relationships between kin, friendship and cooperation, parenting, social organization,
and status (Confer et al., 2010).
Evolutionary psychologists have had success in finding experimental correspondence between observations
and expectations. In one example, in a study of mate preference differences between men and women that
spanned 37 cultures, Buss (1989) found that women valued earning potential factors greater than men, and
men valued potential reproductive factors (youth and attractiveness) greater than women in their prospective
mates. In general, the predictions were in line with the predictions of evolution, although there were deviations
in some cultures.
Sensation and Perception
Scientists interested in both physiological aspects of sensory systems as well as in the psychological
experience of sensory information work within the area of sensation and perception (Figure 1.11). As such,
sensation and perception research is also quite interdisciplinary. Imagine walking between buildings as you
move from one class to another. You are inundated with sights, sounds, touch sensations, and smells. You also
experience the temperature of the air around you and maintain your balance as you make your way. These are

all factors of interest to someone working in the domain of sensation and perception.
FIGURE 1.11 When you look at this image, you may see a duck or a rabbit. The sensory information remains the
same, but your perception can vary dramatically.
As described in a later chapter that focuses on the results of studies in sensation and perception, our
experience of our world is not as simple as the sum total of all of the sensory information (or sensations)
together. Rather, our experience (or perception) is complex and is influenced by where we focus our attention,
our previous experiences, and even our cultural backgrounds.
Cognitive Psychology
As mentioned in the previous section, the cognitive revolution created an impetus for psychologists to focus
their attention on better understanding the mind and mental processes that underlie behavior. Thus, cognitive
psychology is the area of psychology that focuses on studying cognitions, or thoughts, and their relationship to
our experiences and our actions. Like biological psychology, cognitive psychology is broad in its scope and
often involves collaborations among people from a diverse range of disciplinary backgrounds. This has led
some to coin the term cognitive science to describe the interdisciplinary nature of this area of research (Miller,
2003).
Cognitive psychologists have research interests that span a spectrum of topics, ranging from attention to
problem solving to language to memory. The approaches used in studying these topics are equally diverse.
Given such diversity, cognitive psychology is not captured in one chapter of this text per se; rather, various
concepts related to cognitive psychology will be covered in relevant portions of the chapters in this text on
sensation and perception, thinking and intelligence, memory, lifespan development, social psychology, and
therapy.
Developmental Psychology
Developmental psychology is the scientific study of development across a lifespan. Developmental
psychologists are interested in processes related to physical maturation. However, their focus is not limited to
the physical changes associated with aging, as they also focus on changes in cognitive skills, moral reasoning,
social behavior, and other psychological attributes.
Early developmental psychologists focused primarily on changes that occurred through reaching adulthood,
providing enormous insight into the differences in physical, cognitive, and social capacities that exist between
very young children and adults. For instance, research by Jean Piaget (Figure 1.12) demonstrated that very
young children do not demonstrate object permanence. Object permanence refers to the understanding that
physical things continue to exist, even if they are hidden from us. If you were to show an adult a toy, and then
hide it behind a curtain, the adult knows that the toy still exists. However, very young infants act as if a hidden
object no longer exists. The age at which object permanence is achieved is somewhat controversial (Munakata,
McClelland, Johnson, and Siegler, 1997).
1.3 • Contemporary Psychology 21
FIGURE 1.12 Jean Piaget is famous for his theories regarding changes in cognitive ability that occur as we move
from infancy to adulthood.
While Piaget was focused on cognitive changes during infancy and childhood as we move to adulthood, there is
an increasing interest in extending research into the changes that occur much later in life. This may be
reflective of changing population demographics of developed nations as a whole. As more and more people live
longer lives, the number of people of advanced age will continue to increase. Indeed, it is estimated that there
were just over 40 million people aged 65 or older living in the United States in 2010. However, by 2020, this
number is expected to increase to about 55 million. By the year 2050, it is estimated that nearly 90 million
people in this country will be 65 or older (Department of Health and Human Services, n.d.).
Personality Psychology
Personality psychology focuses on patterns of thoughts and behaviors that make each individual unique.
Several individuals (e.g., Freud and Maslow) that we have already discussed in our historical overview of
psychology, and the American psychologist Gordon Allport, contributed to early theories of personality. These
early theorists attempted to explain how an individual’s personality develops from their given perspective. For
example, Freud proposed that personality arose as conflicts between the conscious and unconscious parts of
the mind were carried out over the lifespan. Specifically, Freud theorized that an individual went through
various psychosexual stages of development. According to Freud, adult personality would result from the
resolution of various conflicts that centered on the migration of erogenous (or sexual pleasure-producing)
zones from the oral (mouth) to the anus to the phallus to the genitals. Like many of Freud’s theories, this
particular idea was controversial and did not lend itself to experimental tests (Person, 1980).
More recently, the study of personality has taken on a more quantitative approach. Rather than explaining how
personality arises, research is focused on identifying personality traits, measuring these traits, and
determining how these traits interact in a particular context to determine how a person will behave in any
given situation. Personality traits are relatively consistent patterns of thought and behavior, and many have
proposed that five trait dimensions are sufficient to capture the variations in personality seen across
individuals. These five dimensions are known as the “Big Five” or the Five Factor model, and include
dimensions of conscientiousness, agreeableness, neuroticism, openness, and extraversion (Figure 1.13). Each
of these traits has been demonstrated to be relatively stable over the lifespan (e.g., Rantanen, Metsäpelto, Feldt,
Pulkinnen, and Kokko, 2007; Soldz & Vaillant, 1999; McCrae & Costa, 2008) and is influenced by genetics (e.g.,
Jang, Livesly, and Vernon, 1996).

FIGURE 1.13 Each of the dimensions of the Five Factor model is shown in this figure. The provided description
would describe someone who scored highly on that given dimension. Someone with a lower score on a given
dimension could be described in opposite terms.
Social Psychology
Social psychology focuses on how we interact with and relate to others. Social psychologists conduct research
on a wide variety of topics that include differences in how we explain our own behavior versus how we explain
the behaviors of others, prejudice, and attraction, and how we resolve interpersonal conflicts. Social
psychologists have also sought to determine how being among other people changes our own behavior and
patterns of thinking.
There are many interesting examples of social psychological research, and you will read about many of these
in a later chapter of this textbook. Until then, you will be introduced to one of the most controversial
psychological studies ever conducted. Stanley Milgram was an American social psychologist who is most
famous for research that he conducted on obedience. After the holocaust, in 1961, a Nazi war criminal, Adolf
Eichmann, who was accused of committing mass atrocities, was put on trial. Many people wondered how
German soldiers were capable of torturing prisoners in concentration camps, and they were unsatisfied with
the excuses given by soldiers that they were simply following orders. At the time, most psychologists agreed
that few people would be willing to inflict such extraordinary pain and suffering, simply because they were
obeying orders. Milgram decided to conduct research to determine whether or not this was true (Figure 1.14).
As you will read later in the text, Milgram found that nearly two-thirds of his participants were willing to
deliver what they believed to be lethal shocks to another person, simply because they were instructed to do so
by an authority figure (in this case, a man dressed in a lab coat). This was in spite of the fact that participants
1.3 • Contemporary Psychology 23
During the elementary school stage (ages 7–11), children face the task of industry versus inferiority. Children
begin to compare themselves to their peers to see how they measure up. They either develop a sense of pride
and accomplishment in their schoolwork, sports, social activities, and family life, or they feel inferior and
inadequate when they don’t measure up. What are some things parents and teachers can do to help children
develop a sense of competence and a belief in themselves and their abilities?
In adolescence (ages 12–18), children face the task of identity versus role confusion. According to Erikson, an
adolescent’s main task is developing a sense of self. Adolescents struggle with questions such as “Who am I?”
and “What do I want to do with my life?” Along the way, most adolescents try on many different selves to see
which ones fit. Adolescents who are successful at this stage have a strong sense of identity and are able to
remain true to their beliefs and values in the face of problems and other people’s perspectives. What happens
to apathetic adolescents, who do not make a conscious search for identity, or those who are pressured to
conform to their parents’ ideas for the future? These teens will have a weak sense of self and experience role
confusion. They are unsure of their identity and confused about the future.
People in early adulthood (i.e., 20s through early 40s) are concerned with intimacy versus isolation. After we
have developed a sense of self in adolescence, we are ready to share our life with others. Erikson said that we
must have a strong sense of self before developing intimate relationships with others. Adults who do not
develop a positive self-concept in adolescence may experience feelings of loneliness and emotional isolation.
When people reach their 40s, they enter the time known as middle adulthood, which extends to the mid-60s.
The social task of middle adulthood is generativity versus stagnation. Generativity involves finding your life’s
work and contributing to the development of others, through activities such as volunteering, mentoring, and
raising children. Those who do not master this task may experience stagnation, having little connection with
others and little interest in productivity and self-improvement.
From the mid-60s to the end of life, we are in the period of development known as late adulthood. Erikson’s
task at this stage is called integrity versus despair. He said that people in late adulthood reflect on their lives
and feel either a sense of satisfaction or a sense of failure. People who feel proud of their accomplishments feel
a sense of integrity, and they can look back on their lives with few regrets. However, people who are not
successful at this stage may feel as if their life has been wasted. They focus on what “would have,” “should
have,” and “could have” been. They face the end of their lives with feelings of bitterness, depression, and
despair. Table 9.1 summarizes the stages of Erikson’s theory.

TABLE 9.1
Cognitive Theory of Development
Jean Piaget (1896–1980) is another stage theorist who studied childhood development (Figure 9.5). Instead of
approaching development from a psychoanalytical or psychosocial perspective, Piaget focused on children’s
cognitive growth. He believed that thinking is a central aspect of development and that children are naturally
inquisitive. However, he said that children do not think and reason like adults (Piaget, 1930, 1932). His theory
of cognitive development holds that our cognitive abilities develop through specific stages, which exemplifies
the discontinuity approach to development. As we progress to a new stage, there is a distinct shift in how we
think and reason.
FIGURE 9.5 Jean Piaget spent over 50 years studying children and how their minds develop.
Piaget said that children develop schemata to help them understand the world. Schemata are concepts
(mental models) that are used to help us categorize and interpret information. By the time children have
reached adulthood, they have created schemata for almost everything. When children learn new information,
they adjust their schemata through two processes: assimilation and accommodation. First, they assimilate new
information or experiences in terms of their current schemata: assimilation is when they take in information
that is comparable to what they already know. Accommodation describes when they change their schemata
based on new information. This process continues as children interact with their environment.
For example, 2-year-old Abdul learned the schema for dogs because his family has a Labrador retriever. When
Abdul sees other dogs in his picture books, he says, “Look mommy, dog!” Thus, he has assimilated them into
9.2 • Lifespan Theories 287
his schema for dogs. One day, Abdul sees a sheep for the first time and says, “Look mommy, dog!” Having a
basic schema that a dog is an animal with four legs and fur, Abdul thinks all furry, four-legged creatures are
dogs. When Abdul’s mom tells him that the animal he sees is a sheep, not a dog, Abdul must accommodate his
schema for dogs to include more information based on his new experiences. Abdul’s schema for dog was too
broad, since not all furry, four-legged creatures are dogs. He now modifies his schema for dogs and forms a
new one for sheep.
Like Freud and Erikson, Piaget thought development unfolds in a series of stages approximately associated
with age ranges. He proposed a theory of cognitive development that unfolds in four stages: sensorimotor,
preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational (Table 9.2).

The first stage is the sensorimotor stage, which lasts from birth to about 2 years old. During this stage,
children learn about the world through their senses and motor behavior. Young children put objects in their
mouths to see if the items are edible, and once they can grasp objects, they may shake or bang them to see if
they make sounds. Between 5 and 8 months old, the child develops object permanence, which is the
understanding that even if something is out of sight, it still exists (Bogartz, Shinskey, & Schilling, 2000).
According to Piaget, young infants do not remember an object after it has been removed from sight. Piaget
studied infants’ reactions when a toy was first shown to an infant and then hidden under a blanket. Infants
who had already developed object permanence would reach for the hidden toy, indicating that they knew it still
existed, whereas infants who had not developed object permanence would appear confused.

In Piaget’s view, around the same time children develop object permanence, they also begin to exhibit stranger
anxiety, which is a fear of unfamiliar people. Babies may demonstrate this by crying and turning away from a
stranger, by clinging to a caregiver, or by attempting to reach their arms toward familiar faces such as parents.
Stranger anxiety results when a child is unable to assimilate the stranger into an existing schema; therefore,

she can’t predict what her experience with that stranger will be like, which results in a fear response.
Piaget’s second stage is the preoperational stage, which is from approximately 2 to 7 years old. In this stage,
children can use symbols to represent words, images, and ideas, which is why children in this stage engage in
pretend play. A child’s arms might become airplane wings as they zoom around the room, or a child with a
stick might become a brave knight with a sword. Children also begin to use language in the preoperational
stage, but they cannot understand adult logic or mentally manipulate information (the term operational refers
to logical manipulation of information, so children at this stage are considered to be pre-operational).
Children’s logic is based on their own personal knowledge of the world so far, rather than on conventional
knowledge. For example, dad gave a slice of pizza to 10-year-old Keiko and another slice to her 3-year-old
brother, Kenny. Kenny’s pizza slice was cut into five pieces, so Kenny told his sister that he got more pizza than
she did. Children in this stage cannot perform mental operations because they have not developed an
understanding of conservation, which is the idea that even if you change the appearance of something, it is
still equal in size as long as nothing has been removed or added.

During this stage, we also expect children to display egocentrism, which means that the child is not able to
take the perspective of others. A child at this stage thinks that everyone sees, thinks, and feels just as they do.
Let’s look at Kenny and Keiko again. Keiko’s birthday is coming up, so their mom takes Kenny to the toy store to
choose a present for his sister. He selects an Iron Man action figure for her, thinking that if he likes the toy, his
sister will too. An egocentric child is not able to infer the perspective of other people and instead attributes his
own perspective.
LINK T O LEARNING
Piaget developed the Three-Mountain Task to determine the level of egocentrism displayed by children.
Children view a 3-dimensional mountain scene from one viewpoint, and are asked what another person at a
different viewpoint would see in the same scene. Watch this short video of the Three Mountain Task in action
(http://openstax.org/l/WonderYears) from the University of Minnesota and the Science Museum of Minnesota.
Piaget’s third stage is the concrete operational stage, which occurs from about 7 to 11 years old. In this stage,
children can think logically about real (concrete) events; they have a firm grasp on the use of numbers and
start to employ memory strategies. They can perform mathematical operations and understand
transformations, such as addition is the opposite of subtraction, and multiplication is the opposite of division.
In this stage, children also master the concept of conservation: Even if something changes shape, its mass,
volume, and number stay the same. For example, if you pour water from a tall, thin glass to a short, fat glass,
you still have the same amount of water. Remember Keiko and Kenny and the pizza? How did Keiko know that
Kenny was wrong when he said that he had more pizza?
Children in the concrete operational stage also understand the principle of reversibility, which means that
objects can be changed and then returned back to their original form or condition. Take, for example, water
that you poured into the short, fat glass: You can pour water from the fat glass back to the thin glass and still
have the same amount (minus a couple of drops).
The fourth, and last, stage in Piaget’s theory is the formal operational stage, which is from about age 11 to
adulthood. Whereas children in the concrete operational stage are able to think logically only about concrete
events, children in the formal operational stage can also deal with abstract ideas and hypothetical situations.
Children in this stage can use abstract thinking to problem solve, look at alternative solutions, and test these
9.2 • Lifespan Theories 289
solutions. In adolescence, a renewed egocentrism occurs. For example, a 15-year-old with a very small pimple
on her face might think it is huge and incredibly visible, under the mistaken impression that others must share
her perceptions.
Beyond Formal Operational Thought
As with other major contributors of theories of development, several of Piaget’s ideas have come under
criticism based on the results of further research. For example, several contemporary studies support a model
of development that is more continuous than Piaget’s discrete stages (Courage & Howe, 2002; Siegler, 2005,
2006). Many others suggest that children reach cognitive milestones earlier than Piaget describes (Baillargeon,
2004; de Hevia & Spelke, 2010).
According to Piaget, the highest level of cognitive development is formal operational thought, which develops
between 11 and 20 years old. However, many developmental psychologists disagree with Piaget, suggesting a
fifth stage of cognitive development, known as the postformal stage (Basseches, 1984; Commons & Bresette,
2006; Sinnott, 1998). In postformal thinking, decisions are made based on situations and circumstances, and
logic is integrated with emotion as adults develop principles that depend on contexts. One way that we can see
the difference between an adult in postformal thought and an adolescent in formal operations is in terms of
how they handle emotionally charged issues.
It seems that once we reach adulthood our problem solving abilities change: As we attempt to solve problems,
we tend to think more deeply about many areas of our lives, such as relationships, work, and politics
(Labouvie-Vief & Diehl, 1999). Because of this, postformal thinkers are able to draw on past experiences to help
them solve new problems. Problem-solving strategies using postformal thought vary, depending on the
situation. What does this mean? Adults can recognize, for example, that what seems to be an ideal solution to a
problem at work involving a disagreement with a colleague may not be the best solution to a disagreement with
a significant other.
Neuroconstructivism
The genetic environmental correlation you’ve learned about concerning the bidirectional influence of genes and the
environment has been explored in more recent theories (Newcombe, 2011). One such theory, neuroconstructivism,
suggests that neural brain development influences cognitive development. Experiences that a child encounters can
impact or change the way that neural pathways develop in response to the environment. An individual’s behavior is
based on how one understands the world. There is interaction between neural and cognitive networks at and
between each level, consisting of these:
• genes
• neurons
• brain
• body
• social environment
These interactions shape mental representations in the brain and are dependent on context that individuals actively
explore throughout their lifetimes (Westermann, Mareschal, Johnson, Sirois, Spratling, & Thomas, 2007).
An example of this would be a child who may be genetically predisposed to a difficult temperament. They may have
parents who provide a social environment in which they are encouraged to express themselves in an optimal
manner. The child's brain would form neural connections enhanced by that environment, thus influencing the brain.
The brain gives information to the body about how it will experience the environment. Thus, neural and cognitive
networks work together to influence genes (i.e., attenuating temperament), body (i.e., may be less prone to high
blood pressure), and social environment (i.e., may seek people who are similar to them).

newborn’s response to anything that touches their cheek: When you stroke a baby’s cheek, the baby naturally
turns the head in that direction and begins to suck. The sucking reflex is the automatic, unlearned, sucking
motions that infants do with their mouths. Several other interesting newborn reflexes can be observed. For
instance, if you put your finger into a newborn’s hand, you will witness the grasping reflex, in which a baby
automatically grasps anything that touches the palms. The Moro reflex is the newborn’s response to the
sensation of falling. The baby spreads the arms, pulls them back in, and then (usually) cries. How do you think
these reflexes promote survival in the first months of life?

What can young infants see, hear, and smell? Newborn infants’ sensory abilities are significant, but their
senses are not yet fully developed. Many of a newborn’s innate preferences facilitate interaction with
caregivers and other humans. Although vision is their least developed sense, newborns already show a
preference for faces. Babies who are just a few days old also prefer human voices, they will listen to voices
longer than sounds that do not involve speech (Vouloumanos & Werker, 2004), and they seem to prefer their
mother’s voice over a stranger’s voice (Mills & Melhuish, 1974). In an interesting experiment, 3-week-old
babies were given pacifiers that played a recording of the infant’s mother’s voice and of a stranger’s voice.
When the infants heard their mother’s voice, they sucked more strongly at the pacifier (Mills & Melhuish,
1974). Newborns also have a strong sense of smell. For instance, newborn babies can distinguish the smell of
their own mother from that of others. In a study by MacFarlane (1978), 1-week-old babies who were being
breastfed were placed between two gauze pads. One gauze pad was from the bra of a nursing mother who was a
stranger, and the other gauze pad was from the bra of the infant’s own mother. More than two-thirds of the
week-old babies turned toward the gauze pad with their mother’s scent.
Physical Development
In infancy, toddlerhood, and early childhood, the body’s physical development is rapid (Figure 9.10). On
average, newborns weigh between 5 and 10 pounds, and a newborn’s weight typically doubles in six months
and triples in one year. By 2 years old the weight will have quadrupled, so we can expect that a 2 year old
should weigh between 20 and 40 pounds. The average length of a newborn is 19.5 inches, increasing to 29.5
inches by 12 months and 34.4 inches by 2 years old (WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study Group, 2006).

During infancy and childhood, growth does not occur at a steady rate (Carel, Lahlou, Roger, & Chaussain,
2004). Growth slows between 4 and 6 years old: During this time children gain 5–7 pounds and grow about 2–3
inches per year. Once females reach 8–9 years old, their growth rate outpaces that of males due to a pubertal
growth spurt. This growth spurt continues until around 12 years old, coinciding with the start of the menstrual
9.3 • Stages of Development 297
cycle. By 10 years old, the average female weighs 88 pounds, and the average male weighs 85 pounds.
It was previously believed that we are born with all of the brain cells we will ever have. More recent research
suggests that neurogenesis (the formation of neurons) can continue through adulthood. However, the vast
majority of neural connections and pathways occur during the first few years of a child’s life (National Institute
of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, 2019). This period of rapid neural growth is called blooming. Neural
pathways continue to develop through puberty. The blooming period of neural growth is then followed by a
period of pruning, where neural connections are reduced. It is thought that pruning causes the brain to
function more efficiently, allowing for mastery of more complex skills (Hutchinson, 2011). Blooming occurs
during the first few years of life, and pruning continues through childhood and into adolescence in various
areas of the brain.
The size of our brains increases rapidly. For example, the brain of a 2-year-old is 55% of its adult size, and by 6
years old the brain is about 90% of its adult size (Tanner, 1978). During early childhood (ages 3–6), the frontal
lobes grow rapidly. Recalling our discussion of the 4 lobes of the brain earlier in this book, the frontal lobes are
associated with planning, reasoning, memory, and impulse control. Therefore, by the time children reach
school age, they are developmentally capable of controlling their attention and behavior. Through the
elementary school years, the frontal, temporal, occipital, and parietal lobes all grow in size. The brain growth
spurts experienced in childhood tend to follow Piaget’s sequence of cognitive development, so that significant
changes in neural functioning account for cognitive advances (Kolb & Whishaw, 2009; Overman, Bachevalier,
Turner, & Peuster, 1992).
Motor development occurs in an orderly sequence as infants move from reflexive reactions (e.g., sucking and
rooting) to more advanced motor functioning. For instance, babies first learn to hold their heads up, then to sit
with assistance, and then to sit unassisted, followed later by crawling and then walking.
Motor skills refer to our ability to move our bodies and manipulate objects. Fine motor skills focus on the
muscles in our fingers, toes, and eyes, and enable coordination of small actions (e.g., grasping a toy, writing
with a pencil, and using a spoon). Gross motor skills focus on large muscle groups that control our arms and
legs and involve larger movements (e.g., balancing, running, and jumping).
As motor skills develop, there are certain developmental milestones that young children should achieve (Table
9.4). For each milestone there is an average age, as well as a range of ages in which the milestone should be
reached. An example of a developmental milestone is sitting. On average, most babies sit alone at 7 months
old. Sitting involves both coordination and muscle strength, and 90% of babies achieve this milestone between
5 and 9 months old. In another example, babies on average are able to hold up their head at 6 weeks old, and
90% of babies achieve this between 3 weeks and 4 months old. If a baby is not holding up their head by 4
months old, they are showing a delay. If the child is displaying delays on several milestones, that is reason for
concern, and the parent or caregiver should discuss this with the child’s pediatrician. Some developmental
delays can be identified and addressed through early intervention.

Cognitive Development
In addition to rapid physical growth, young children also exhibit significant development of their cognitive
abilities. Piaget thought that children’s ability to understand objects—such as learning that a rattle makes a
noise when shaken—was a cognitive skill that develops slowly as a child matures and interacts with the
environment. Today, developmental psychologists think Piaget was incorrect. Researchers have found that
even very young children understand objects and how they work long before they have experience with those
objects (Baillargeon, 1987; Baillargeon, Li, Gertner, & Wu, 2011). For example, children as young as 3 months
old demonstrated knowledge of the properties of objects that they had only viewed and did not have prior
experience with them. In one study, 3-month-old infants were shown a truck rolling down a track and behind a
screen. The box, which appeared solid but was actually hollow, was placed next to the track. The truck rolled
past the box as would be expected. Then the box was placed on the track to block the path of the truck. When
the truck was rolled down the track this time, it continued unimpeded. The infants spent significantly more
time looking at this impossible event (Figure 9.11). Baillargeon (1987) concluded that they knew solid objects
cannot pass through each other. Baillargeon’s findings suggest that very young children have an understanding
of objects and how they work, which Piaget (1954) would have said is beyond their cognitive abilities due to
their limited experiences in the world.
FIGURE 9.11 In Baillargeon’s study, infants observed a truck (a) roll down an unobstructed track, (b) roll down an
unobstructed track with an obstruction (box) beside it, and (c) roll down and pass through what appeared to be an
obstruction.
Just as there are physical milestones that we expect children to reach, there are also cognitive milestones. It is
helpful to be aware of these milestones as children gain new abilities to think, problem solve, and
communicate. For example, infants shake their head “no” around 6–9 months, and they respond to verbal
requests to do things like “wave bye-bye” or “blow a kiss” around 9–12 months. Remember Piaget’s ideas
about object permanence? We can expect children to grasp the concept that objects continue to exist even
when they are not in sight by around 8 months old. Because toddlers (i.e., 12–24 months old) have mastered
9.3 • Stages of Development 299
object permanence, they enjoy games like hide and seek, and they realize that when someone leaves the room
they will come back (Loop, 2013). Toddlers also point to pictures in books and look in appropriate places when
you ask them to find objects.
Preschool-age children (i.e., 3–5 years old) also make steady progress in cognitive development. Not only can
they count, name colors, and tell you their name and age, but they can also make some decisions on their own,
such as choosing an outfit to wear. Preschool-age children understand basic time concepts and sequencing
(e.g., before and after), and they can predict what will happen next in a story. They also begin to enjoy the use
of humor in stories. Because they can think symbolically, they enjoy pretend play and inventing elaborate
characters and scenarios. One of the most common examples of their cognitive growth is their blossoming
curiosity. Preschool-age children love to ask “Why?”
An important cognitive change occurs in children this age. Recall that Piaget described 2–3 year olds as
egocentric, meaning that they do not have an awareness of others’ points of view. Between 3 and 5 years old,
children come to understand that people have thoughts, feelings, and beliefs that are different from their own.
This is known as theory-of-mind (TOM). Children can use this skill to tease others, persuade their parents to
purchase a candy bar, or understand why a sibling might be angry. When children develop TOM, they can
recognize that others have false beliefs (Dennett, 1987; Callaghan et al., 2005).
LINK T O LEARNING
False-belief tasks are useful in determining a child’s acquisition of theory-of-mind (TOM). Take a look at this
video clip that shows a false belief task involving a box of crayons (http://openstax.org/l/crayons) to learn more.
Cognitive skills continue to expand in middle and late childhood (6–11 years old). Thought processes become
more logical and organized when dealing with concrete information (Figure 9.12). Children at this age
understand concepts such as the past, present, and future, giving them the ability to plan and work toward
goals. Additionally, they can process complex ideas such as addition and subtraction and cause-and-effect
relationships. However, children’s attention spans tend to be very limited until they are around 11 years old.
After that point, it begins to improve through adulthood.
FIGURE 9.12 Because they understand luck and fairness, children in middle and late childhood (6–11 years old)
are able to follow rules for games. (credit: Edwin Martinez)
One well-researched aspect of cognitive development is language acquisition. As mentioned earlier, the order
in which children learn language structures is consistent across children and cultures (Hatch, 1983). You’ve
also learned that some psychological researchers have proposed that children possess a biological
predisposition for language acquisition.
Starting before birth, babies begin to develop language and communication skills. At birth, babies apparently
recognize their mother’s voice and can discriminate between the language(s) spoken by their mothers and
foreign languages, and they show preferences for faces that are moving in synchrony with audible language
(Blossom & Morgan, 2006; Pickens, 1994; Spelke & Cortelyou, 1981).
Children communicate information through gesturing long before they speak, and there is some evidence that
300 9 • Lifespan Development
Access for free at openstax.org
gesture usage predicts subsequent language development (Iverson & Goldin-Meadow, 2005). In terms of
producing spoken language, babies begin to coo almost immediately. Cooing is a one-syllable combination of a
consonant and a vowel sound (e.g., coo or ba). Interestingly, babies replicate sounds from their own languages.
A baby whose parents speak French will coo in a different tone than a baby whose parents speak Spanish or
Urdu. After cooing, the baby starts to babble. Babbling begins with repeating a syllable, such as ma-ma, da-da,
or ba-ba. When babies are about 12 months old, we expect them to say their first word for meaning, and to
start combining words for meaning at about 18 months.
At about 2 years old, a toddler uses between 50 and 200 words; by 3 years old they have a vocabulary of up to
1,000 words and can speak in sentences. During the early childhood years, children's vocabulary increases at a
rapid pace. This is sometimes referred to as the “vocabulary spurt” and has been claimed to involve an
expansion in vocabulary at a rate of 10–20 new words per week. Recent research may indicate that while some
children experience these spurts, it is far from universal (as discussed in Ganger & Brent, 2004). It has been
estimated that, 5 year olds understand about 6,000 words, speak 2,000 words, and can define words and
question their meanings. They can rhyme and name the days of the week. Seven year olds speak fluently and
use slang and clichés (Stork & Widdowson, 1974).
What accounts for such dramatic language learning by children? Behaviorist B. F. Skinner thought that we
learn language in response to reinforcement or feedback, such as through parental approval or through being
understood. For example, when a two-year-old child asks for juice, he might say, “me juice,” to which his
mother might respond by giving him a cup of apple juice. Noam Chomsky (1957) criticized Skinner’s theory
and proposed that we are all born with an innate capacity to learn language. Chomsky called this mechanism a
language acquisition device (LAD). Who is correct? Both Chomsky and Skinner are right. Remember that we
are a product of both nature and nurture. Researchers now believe that language acquisition is partially inborn
and partially learned through our interactions with our linguistic environment (Gleitman & Newport, 1995;
Stork & Widdowson, 1974).
Attachment
Psychosocial development occurs as children form relationships, interact with others, and understand and
manage their feelings. In social and emotional development, forming healthy attachments is very important
and is the major social milestone of infancy. Attachment is a long-standing connection or bond with others.
Developmental psychologists are interested in how infants reach this milestone. They ask such questions as:
How do parent and infant attachment bonds form? How does neglect affect these bonds? What accounts for
children’s attachment differences?
Researchers Harry Harlow, John Bowlby, and Mary Ainsworth conducted studies designed to answer these
questions. In the 1950s, Harlow conducted a series of experiments on monkeys. He separated newborn
monkeys from their mothers. Each monkey was presented with two surrogate mothers. One surrogate monkey
was made out of wire mesh, and she could dispense milk. The other monkey was softer and made from cloth:
This monkey did not dispense milk. Research shows that the monkeys preferred the soft, cuddly cloth monkey,
even though she did not provide any nourishment. The baby monkeys spent their time clinging to the cloth
monkey and only went to the wire monkey when they needed to be fed. Prior to this study, the medical and
scientific communities generally thought that babies become attached to the people who provide their
nourishment. However, Harlow (1958) concluded that there was more to the mother-child bond than
nourishment. Feelings of comfort and security are the critical components to maternal-infant bonding, which
leads to healthy psychosocial development.

Biopsychology and Evolutionary Psychology As the name suggests, biopsychology explores how our biology influences our behavior. While biological psychology is a broad field, many biological psychologists want to understand how the structure and function of the nervous system is related to behavior (Figure 1.10). As such, they often combine the research strategies of both psychologists and physiologists to accomplish this goal (as discussed in Carlson, 2013). FIGURE 1.10 Biological psychologists study how the structure and function of the nervous system generate behavior. The research interests of biological psychologists span a number of domains, including but not limited to, 1.3 • Contemporary Psychology 19 sensory and motor systems, sleep, drug use and abuse, ingestive behavior, learning and memory, personality and personality disorders, and mental health. 2.4 • Clinical Psychology and Counseling 3.5 • Developmental Psychology, Social Psychology, and Social Cognition 4.6 • Cognitive Neuroscience 5.7 • Neuropsychology 6.8 • Psychophysiology 7.9 • Neuroendocrinology, Neuroimmunology, Neurobiology of Learning and Memory 8.0 • Behavioral Genetics 9.2 • Human Development and Aging Biological psychology is an interdisciplinary field that draws on knowledge from a wide range of disciplines, including biology, physiology, neurology, psychiatry, sociology, anthropology, linguistics, psychology, neuroscience, computer science, mathematics, statistics, philosophy, history, law, economics, art, music, literature, dance, theater, film, literature, television, radio, video games, etc. In addition to the above disciplines, there are many subfields within biological psychology that focus on a particular aspect of biological processes. For example, the field of neurobiology is concerned with the study of brain and nervous system function and structure, as well as the molecular and cellular processes that underlie these processes. Neuropsychologists study the effects of disease and injury on brain function, while neuroscientists study how the brain processes information and how it changes over time in response to experience. Psychobiologists study the biological basis of human behavior and personality. Behavioral genetics focuses on the genetic basis of behavior in humans and other animals. Finally, human development and aging studies the physical and psychological development of humans from conception to old age. Evolutionary psychology (also known as cultural psychology) is the branch of psychological science that investigates how people acquire and use knowledge and skills, how they learn from their environment, how they interact with other people and with nature, what motivates people to behave in certain ways, what drives them to act in particular ways, why people behave the way they do and why they behave differently from person to person and from one culture to another. It is also a subfield of evolutionary biology, which studies how organisms adapt to their environments in order to survive and reproduce. Although evolutionary psychology has its roots in evolutionary biology and genetics, it is distinct from that field in that it does not focus solely on biological processes, but also on social and cultural processes.

Genes affect more than our physical characteristics. Indeed, scientists have found genetic linkages to a
number of behavioral characteristics, ranging from basic personality traits to sexual orientation to spirituality
(for examples, see Mustanski et al., 2005; Comings, Gonzales, Saucier, Johnson, & MacMurray, 2000). Genes are
also associated with temperament and a number of psychological disorders, such as depression and
schizophrenia. So while it is true that genes provide the biological blueprints for our cells, tissues, organs, and
body, they also have a significant impact on our experiences and our behaviors.
Let’s look at the following findings regarding schizophrenia in light of our three views of gene-environment
interactions. Which view do you think best explains this evidence?
In a 2004 study by Tienari and colleagues, adoptees whose biological mothers had schizophrenia and who had
been raised in a disturbed family environment were much more likely to develop schizophrenia or another
psychotic disorder than were any of the other groups in the study:
• Of adoptees whose biological mothers had schizophrenia (high genetic risk) and who were raised in
disturbed family environments, 36.8% were likely to develop schizophrenia.
• Of adoptees whose biological mothers had schizophrenia (high genetic risk) and who were raised in
healthy family environments, 5.8% were likely to develop schizophrenia.
• Of adoptees with a low genetic risk (whose mothers did not have schizophrenia) and who were raised in
disturbed family environments, 5.3% were likely to develop schizophrenia.
• Of adoptees with a low genetic risk (whose mothers did not have schizophrenia) and who were raised in
healthy family environments, 4.8% were likely to develop schizophrenia.
The study shows that adoptees with high genetic risk were most likely to develop schizophrenia if they were
raised in disturbed home environments. This research lends credibility to the notion that both genetic
vulnerability and environmental stress are necessary for schizophrenia to develop, and that genes alone do not
tell the full tale.
3.2 Cells of the Nervous System
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Identify the basic parts of a neuron
• Describe how neurons communicate with each other
• Explain how drugs act as agonists or antagonists for a given neurotransmitter system
Psychologists striving to understand the human mind may study the nervous system. Learning how the body's
cells and organs function can help us understand the biological basis of human psychology. The nervous
system is composed of two basic cell types: glial cells (also known as glia) and neurons. Glial cells are
traditionally thought to play a supportive role to neurons, both physically and metabolically. Glial cells provide
scaffolding on which the nervous system is built, help neurons line up closely with each other to allow
neuronal communication, provide insulation to neurons, transport nutrients and waste products, and mediate
immune responses. For years, researchers believed that there were many more glial cells than neurons;
however, more recent work from Suzanna Herculano-Houzel's laboratory has called this long-standing
assumption into question and has provided important evidence that there may be a nearly 1:1 ratio of glia cells
to neurons. This is important because it suggests that human brains are more similar to other primate brains
than previously thought (Azevedo et al, 2009; Herculano-Houzel, 2012; Herculano-Houzel, 2009). Neurons, on
78 3 • Biopsychology

the other hand, serve as interconnected information processors that are essential for all of the tasks of the
nervous system. This section briefly describes the structure and function of neurons.
Neuron Structure
Neurons are the central building blocks of the nervous system, 100 billion strong at birth. Like all cells,
neurons consist of several different parts, each serving a specialized function (Figure 3.8). A neuron’s outer
surface is made up of a semipermeable membrane. This membrane allows smaller molecules and molecules
without an electrical charge to pass through it, while stopping larger or highly charged molecules.
FIGURE 3.8 This illustration shows a prototypical neuron, which is being myelinated by a glial cell.
The nucleus of the neuron is located in the soma, or cell body. The soma has branching extensions known as
dendrites. The neuron is a small information processor, and dendrites serve as input sites where signals are
received from other neurons. These signals are transmitted electrically across the soma and down a major
extension from the soma known as the axon, which ends at multiple terminal buttons. The terminal buttons
contain synaptic vesicles that house neurotransmitters, the chemical messengers of the nervous system.
Axons range in length from a fraction of an inch to several feet. In some axons, glial cells form a fatty substance
known as the myelin sheath, which coats the axon and acts as an insulator, increasing the speed at which the
signal travels. The myelin sheath is not continuous and there are small gaps that occur down the length of the
axon. These gaps in the myelin sheath are known as the Nodes of Ranvier. The myelin sheath is crucial for the
normal operation of the neurons within the nervous system: the loss of the insulation it provides can be
detrimental to normal function. To understand how this works, let’s consider an example. PKU, a genetic
disorder discussed earlier, causes a reduction in myelin and abnormalities in white matter cortical and
subcortical structures. The disorder is associated with a variety of issues including severe cognitive deficits,
exaggerated reflexes, and seizures (Anderson & Leuzzi, 2010; Huttenlocher, 2000). Another disorder, multiple
sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disorder, involves a large-scale loss of the myelin sheath on axons throughout
the nervous system. The resulting interference in the electrical signal prevents the quick transmittal of
information by neurons and can lead to a number of symptoms, such as dizziness, fatigue, loss of motor
control, and sexual dysfunction. While some treatments may help to modify the course of the disease and
manage certain symptoms, there is currently no known cure for multiple sclerosis.
In healthy individuals, the neuronal signal moves rapidly down the axon to the terminal buttons, where
synaptic vesicles release neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft (Figure 3.9). The synaptic cleft is a very
small space between two neurons and is an important site where communication between neurons occurs.
Once neurotransmitters are released into the synaptic cleft, they travel across it and bind with corresponding
receptors on the dendrite of an adjacent neuron. Receptors, proteins on the cell surface where
neurotransmitters attach, vary in shape, with different shapes “matching” different neurotransmitters.
How does a neurotransmitter “know” which receptor to bind to? The neurotransmitter and the receptor have
3.2 • Cells of the Nervous System 79
what is referred to as a lock-and-key relationship—specific neurotransmitters fit specific receptors similar to
how a key fits a lock. The neurotransmitter binds to any receptor that it fits.
FIGURE 3.9 (a) The synaptic cleft is the space between the terminal button of one neuron and the dendrite of
another neuron. (b) In this pseudo-colored image from a scanning electron microscope, a terminal button (green)
has been opened to reveal the synaptic vesicles (orange and blue) inside. Each vesicle contains about 10,000
neurotransmitter molecules. (credit b: modification of work by Tina Carvalho, NIH-NIGMS; scale-bar data from Matt
Russell)
Neuronal Communication
Now that we have learned about the basic structures of the neuron and the role that these structures play in
neuronal communication, let’s take a closer look at the signal itself—how it moves through the neuron and then
jumps to the next neuron, where the process is repeated.
We begin at the neuronal membrane. The neuron exists in a fluid environment—it is surrounded by
extracellular fluid and contains intracellular fluid (i.e., cytoplasm). The neuronal membrane keeps these two
fluids separate—a critical role because the electrical signal that passes through the neuron depends on the
intra- and extracellular fluids being electrically different. This difference in charge across the membrane,
called the membrane potential, provides energy for the signal.
The electrical charge of the fluids is caused by charged molecules (ions) dissolved in the fluid. The
semipermeable nature of the neuronal membrane somewhat restricts the movement of these charged
molecules, and, as a result, some of the charged particles tend to become more concentrated either inside or
outside the cell.
Between signals, the neuron membrane’s potential is held in a state of readiness, called the resting potential.
Like a rubber band stretched out and waiting to spring into action, ions line up on either side of the cell
membrane, ready to rush across the membrane when the neuron goes active and the membrane opens its
gates. Ions in high-concentration areas are ready to move to low-concentration areas, and positive ions are
ready to move to areas with a negative charge.
In the resting state, sodium (Na+) is at higher concentrations outside the cell, so it will tend to move into the
cell. Potassium (K+), on the other hand, is more concentrated inside the cell, and will tend to move out of the
cell (Figure 3.10). In addition, the inside of the cell is slightly negatively charged compared to the outside, due
to the activity of the sodium-potassium pump. This pump actively transports three sodium ions out of the cell
for every two potassium ions in, creating a net negative charge inside the cell. This provides an additional
force on sodium, causing it to move into the cell.
80 3 • Biopsychology
Access for free at openstax.org
FIGURE 3.10 At resting potential, Na+ (blue pentagons) is more highly concentrated outside the cell in the
extracellular fluid (shown in blue), whereas K+ (purple squares) is more highly concentrated near the membrane in
the cytoplasm or intracellular fluid. Other molecules, such as chloride ions (yellow circles) and negatively charged
proteins (brown squares), help contribute to a positive net charge in the extracellular fluid and a negative net charge
in the intracellular fluid.
From this resting potential state, the neuron receives a signal and its state changes abruptly (Figure 3.11).
When a neuron receives signals at the dendrites—due to neurotransmitters from an adjacent neuron binding
to its receptors—small pores, or gates, open on the neuronal membrane, allowing Na+ ions, propelled by both
charge and concentration differences, to move into the cell. With this influx of positive ions, the internal
charge of the cell becomes more positive. If that charge reaches a certain level, called the threshold of
excitation, the neuron becomes active and the action potential begins.
Many additional pores open, causing a massive influx of Na+ ions and a huge positive spike in the membrane
potential, the peak action potential. At the peak of the spike, the sodium gates close and the potassium gates
open. As positively charged potassium ions leave, the cell quickly begins repolarization. At first, it
hyperpolarizes, becoming slightly more negative than the resting potential, and then it levels off, returning to
the resting potential.
FIGURE 3.11 During the action potential, the electrical charge across the membrane changes dramatically.
This positive spike constitutes the action potential: the electrical signal that typically moves from the cell body
down the axon to the axon terminals. The electrical signal moves down the axon with the impulses jumping in
a leapfrog fashion between the Nodes of Ranvier. The Nodes of Ranvier are natural gaps in the myelin sheath.
At each point, some of the sodium ions that enter the cell diffuse to the next section of the axon, raising the
charge past the threshold of excitation and triggering a new influx of sodium ions. The action potential moves
3.2 • Cells of the Nervous System 81
all the way down the axon in this fashion until reaching the terminal buttons.
The action potential is an all-or-none phenomenon. In simple terms, this means that an incoming signal from
another neuron is either sufficient or insufficient to reach the threshold of excitation. There is no in-between,
and there is no turning off an action potential once it starts. Think of it like sending an email or a text message.
You can think about sending it all you want, but the message is not sent until you hit the send button.
Furthermore, once you send the message, there is no stopping it.
Because it is all or none, the action potential is recreated, or propagated, at its full strength at every point along
the axon. Much like the lit fuse of a firecracker, it does not fade away as it travels down the axon. It is this all-or-
none property that explains the fact that your brain perceives an injury to a distant body part like your toe as
equally painful as one to your nose.
As noted earlier, when the action potential arrives at the terminal button, the synaptic vesicles release their
neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitters travel across the synapse and bind to
receptors on the dendrites of the adjacent neuron, and the process repeats itself in the new neuron (assuming
the signal is sufficiently strong to trigger an action potential). Once the signal is delivered, excess
neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft drift away, are broken down into inactive fragments, or are reabsorbed
in a process known as reuptake. Reuptake involves the neurotransmitter being pumped back into the neuron
that released it, in order to clear the synapse (Figure 3.12). Clearing the synapse serves both to provide a clear
“on” and “off” state between signals and to regulate the production of neurotransmitter (full synaptic vesicles
provide signals that no additional neurotransmitters need to be produced).
FIGURE 3.12 Reuptake involves moving a neurotransmitter from the synapse back into the axon terminal from
which it was released.
Neuronal communication is often referred to as an electrochemical event. The movement of the action
potential down the length of the axon is an electrical event, and movement of the neurotransmitter across the
synaptic space represents the chemical portion of the process. However, there are some specialized
connections between neurons that are entirely electrical. In such cases, the neurons are said to communicate
via an electrical synapse. In these cases, two neurons physically connect to one another via gap junctions,
which allows the current from one cell to pass into the next. There are far fewer electrical synapses in the
brain, but those that do exist are much faster than the chemical synapses that have been described above
(Connors & Long, 2004).

Neurotransmitters and Drugs
There are several different types of neurotransmitters released by different neurons, and we can speak in
broad terms about the kinds of functions associated with different neurotransmitters (Table 3.1). Much of what
psychologists know about the functions of neurotransmitters comes from research on the effects of drugs in
psychological disorders. Psychologists who take a biological perspective and focus on the physiological
causes of behavior assert that psychological disorders like depression and schizophrenia are associated with
imbalances in one or more neurotransmitter systems. In this perspective, psychotropic medications can help
improve the symptoms associated with these disorders. Psychotropic medications are drugs that treat
psychiatric symptoms by restoring neurotransmitter balance.
Major Neurotransmitters and How They Affect Behavior
Neurotransmitter Involved in Potential Effect on Behavior
Acetylcholine Muscle action, memory Increased arousal, enhanced cognition
Beta-endorphin Pain, pleasure Decreased anxiety, decreased tension
Dopamine Mood, sleep, learning Increased pleasure, suppressed appetite
Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) Brain function, sleep Decreased anxiety, decreased tension
Glutamate Memory, learning Increased learning, enhanced memory
Norepinephrine Heart, intestines, alertness Increased arousal, suppressed appetite
Serotonin Mood, sleep Modulated mood, suppressed appetite
TABLE 3.1
Psychoactive drugs can act as agonists or antagonists for a given neurotransmitter system. Agonists are
chemicals that mimic a neurotransmitter at the receptor site. An antagonist, on the other hand, blocks or
impedes the normal activity of a neurotransmitter at the receptor. Agonists and antagonists represent drugs
that are prescribed to correct the specific neurotransmitter imbalances underlying a person’s condition. For
example, Parkinson's disease, a progressive nervous system disorder, is associated with low levels of
dopamine. Therefore, a common treatment strategy for Parkinson's disease involves using dopamine agonists,
which mimic the effects of dopamine by binding to dopamine receptors.
Certain symptoms of schizophrenia are associated with overactive dopamine neurotransmission. The
antipsychotics used to treat these symptoms are antagonists for dopamine—they block dopamine’s effects by
binding its receptors without activating them. Thus, they prevent dopamine released by one neuron from
signaling information to adjacent neurons.
In contrast to agonists and antagonists, which both operate by binding to receptor sites, reuptake inhibitors
prevent unused neurotransmitters from being transported back to the neuron. This allows neurotransmitters
to remain active in the synaptic cleft for longer durations, increasing their effectiveness. Depression, which
has been consistently linked with reduced serotonin levels, is commonly treated with selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). By preventing reuptake, SSRIs strengthen the effect of serotonin, giving it more
time to interact with serotonin receptors on dendrites. Common SSRIs on the market today include Prozac,
Paxil, and Zoloft. The drug LSD is structurally very similar to serotonin, and it affects the same neurons and
receptors as serotonin. Psychotropic drugs are not instant solutions for people suffering from psychological
disorders. Often, an individual must take a drug for several weeks before seeing improvement, and many
3.2 • Cells of the Nervous System 83
psychoactive drugs have significant negative side effects. Furthermore, individuals vary dramatically in how
they respond to the drugs. To improve chances for success, it is not uncommon for people receiving
pharmacotherapy to undergo psychological and/or behavioral therapies as well. Some research suggests that
combining drug therapy with other forms of therapy tends to be more effective than any one treatment alone
(for one such example, see March et al., 2007).
3.3 Parts of the Nervous System
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the difference between the central and peripheral nervous systems
• Explain the difference between the somatic and autonomic nervous systems
• Differentiate between the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system
The nervous system can be divided into two major subdivisions: the central nervous system (CNS) and the
peripheral nervous system (PNS), shown in Figure 3.13. The CNS is comprised of the brain and spinal cord;
the PNS connects the CNS to the rest of the body. In this section, we focus on the peripheral nervous system;
later, we look at the brain and spinal cord.
FIGURE 3.13 The nervous system is divided into two major parts: (a) the Central Nervous System and (b) the
Peripheral Nervous System.
Peripheral Nervous System
The peripheral nervous system is made up of thick bundles of axons, called nerves, carrying messages back
and forth between the CNS and the muscles, organs, and senses in the periphery of the body (i.e., everything
outside the CNS). The PNS has two major subdivisions: the somatic nervous system and the autonomic
84 3 • Biopsychology
Access for free at openstax.org
nervous system.
The somatic nervous system is associated with activities traditionally thought of as conscious or voluntary. It
is involved in the relay of sensory and motor information to and from the CNS; therefore, it consists of motor
neurons and sensory neurons. Motor neurons, carrying instructions from the CNS to the muscles, are efferent
fibers (efferent means “moving away from”). Sensory neurons, carrying sensory information to the CNS, are
afferent fibers (afferent means “moving toward”). A helpful way to remember this is that efferent = exit and
afferent = arrive. Each nerve is basically a bundle of neurons forming a two-way superhighway, containing
thousands of axons, both efferent and afferent.
The autonomic nervous system controls our internal organs and glands and is generally considered to be
outside the realm of voluntary control. It can be further subdivided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic
divisions (Figure 3.14). The sympathetic nervous system is involved in preparing the body for stress-related
activities; the parasympathetic nervous system is associated with returning the body to routine, day-to-day
operations. The two systems have complementary functions, operating in tandem to maintain the body’s
homeostasis. Homeostasis is a state of equilibrium, or balance, in which biological conditions (such as body
temperature) are maintained at optimal levels.
FIGURE 3.14 The sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system have the opposite
effects on various systems.
The sympathetic nervous system is activated when we are faced with stressful or high-arousal situations. The
activity of this system was adaptive for our ancestors, increasing their chances of survival. Imagine, for
example, that one of our early ancestors, out hunting small game, suddenly disturbs a large bear with her cubs.
At that moment, the hunter's body undergoes a series of changes—a direct function of sympathetic
activation—preparing them to face the threat. The pupils dilate, the heart rate and blood pressure increase, the
bladder relaxes, and the liver releases glucose; adrenaline surges into the bloodstream. This constellation of

Summary
3.1 Human Genetics
Genes are sequences of DNA that code for a particular trait. Different versions of a gene are called
alleles—sometimes alleles can be classified as dominant or recessive. A dominant allele always results in the
dominant phenotype. In order to exhibit a recessive phenotype, an individual must be homozygous for the
recessive allele. Genes affect both physical and psychological characteristics. Ultimately, how and when a gene
is expressed, and what the outcome will be—in terms of both physical and psychological characteristics—is a
function of the interaction between our genes and our environments.
3.2 Cells of the Nervous System
Glia and neurons are the two cell types that make up the nervous system. While glia generally play supporting
roles, the communication between neurons is fundamental to all of the functions associated with the nervous
system. Neuronal communication is made possible by the neuron’s specialized structures. The soma contains
the cell nucleus, and the dendrites extend from the soma in tree-like branches. The axon is another major
extension of the cell body; axons are often covered by a myelin sheath, which increases the speed of
transmission of neural impulses. At the end of the axon are terminal buttons that contain synaptic vesicles
filled with neurotransmitters.
Neuronal communication is an electrochemical event. The dendrites contain receptors for neurotransmitters
released by nearby neurons. If the signals received from other neurons are sufficiently strong, an action
potential will travel down the length of the axon to the terminal buttons, resulting in the release of
neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. Action potentials operate on the all-or-none principle and involve

the movement of Na+ and K+ across the neuronal membrane.
Different neurotransmitters are associated with different functions. Often, psychological disorders involve
imbalances in a given neurotransmitter system. Therefore, psychotropic drugs are prescribed in an attempt to
bring the neurotransmitters back into balance. Drugs can act either as agonists or as antagonists for a given
neurotransmitter system.
3.3 Parts of the Nervous System
The brain and spinal cord make up the central nervous system. The peripheral nervous system is comprised of
the somatic and autonomic nervous systems. The somatic nervous system transmits sensory and motor
signals to and from the central nervous system. The autonomic nervous system controls the function of our
organs and glands, and can be divided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions. Sympathetic
activation prepares us for fight or flight, while parasympathetic activation is associated with normal
functioning under relaxed conditions.
3.4 The Brain and Spinal Cord
The brain consists of two hemispheres, each controlling the opposite side of the body. Each hemisphere can be
subdivided into different lobes: frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital. In addition to the lobes of the
cerebral cortex, the forebrain includes the thalamus (sensory relay) and limbic system (emotion and memory
circuit). The midbrain contains the reticular formation, which is important for sleep and arousal, as well as the
substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area. These structures are important for movement, reward, and
addictive processes. The hindbrain contains the structures of the brainstem (medulla, pons, and midbrain),
which control automatic functions like breathing and blood pressure. The hindbrain also contains the
cerebellum, which helps coordinate movement and certain types of memories.
Individuals with brain damage have been studied extensively to provide information about the role of different
areas of the brain, and recent advances in technology allow us to glean similar information by imaging brain
structure and function. These techniques include CT, PET, MRI, fMRI, and EEG.
3.5 The Endocrine System
The glands of the endocrine system secrete hormones to regulate normal body functions. The hypothalamus
serves as the interface between the nervous system and the endocrine system, and it controls the secretions of
the pituitary. The pituitary serves as the master gland, controlling the secretions of all other glands. The
thyroid secretes thyroxine, which is important for basic metabolic processes and growth; the adrenal glands
secrete hormones involved in the stress response; the pancreas secretes hormones that regulate blood sugar
levels; and the ovaries and testes produce sex hormones that regulate sexual motivation and behavior.

","Answer VERY concisely from the provided context only. Your answer length: less or equal 150 tokens. Plain text, no Markdown. Answer only, no other questions. Context: expressed over time and through their unique environmental interactions. The epigenetic perspective is very different from range of reaction, because here the genotype is not fixed and limited. LINK T O LEARNING Watch this video about the epigenetics of twin studies (http://openstax.org/l/twinstudy) to learn more. Genes affect more than our physical characteristics. Indeed, scientists have found genetic linkages to a number of behavioral characteristics, ranging from basic personality traits to sexual orientation to spirituality (for examples, see Mustanski et al., 2005; Comings, Gonzales, Saucier, Johnson, & MacMurray, 2000). Genes are also associated with temperament and a number of psychological disorders, such as depression and schizophrenia. So while it is true that genes provide the biological blueprints for our cells, tissues, organs, and body, they also have a significant impact on our experiences and our behaviors. Let’s look at the following findings regarding schizophrenia in light of our three views of gene-environment interactions. Which view do you think best explains this evidence? In a 2004 study by Tienari and colleagues, adoptees whose biological mothers had schizophrenia and who had been raised in a disturbed family environment were much more likely to develop schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder than were any of the other groups in the study: • Of adoptees whose biological mothers had schizophrenia (high genetic risk) and who were raised in disturbed family environments, 36.8% were likely to develop schizophrenia. • Of adoptees whose biological mothers had schizophrenia (high genetic risk) and who were raised in healthy family environments, 5.8% were likely to develop schizophrenia. • Of adoptees with a low genetic risk (whose mothers did not have schizophrenia) and who were raised in disturbed family environments, 5.3% were likely to develop schizophrenia. • Of adoptees with a low genetic risk (whose mothers did not have schizophrenia) and who were raised in healthy family environments, 4.8% were likely to develop schizophrenia. The study shows that adoptees with high genetic risk were most likely to develop schizophrenia if they were raised in disturbed home environments. This is consistent with our view that the environment plays a major role in determining whether or not an individual will develop a psychological disorder. In contrast, the study suggests that if an adoptee’s biological mother had no schizophrenia, she would not be at risk for developing a psychotic disorder, even if she had raised her adoptive child in an environment of high genetic risk. In another study, researchers found that children of mothers with schizophrenia had a significantly higher risk of developing schizophrenia than did children whose mothers were not schizophrenic. They also found that the risk of schizophrenia was significantly greater for boys than for girls. These findings are consistent with our views on the role of genetics in schizophrenia. For example, we know that schizophrenia is more common in males than in females and that boys are at greater risk than girls for developing the disorder. However, these findings do not necessarily mean that genetics is the only factor that determines whether or not a child develops a mental illness. There are many other factors that may play a role, including environmental factors and biological factors, as well as both genetic and non-genetic factors. Therefore, it is important to consider all of these factors when trying to understand why some children develop mental illnesses and others don’t. Another example of how genetics and environment interact can be found in studies of twins. Researchers found that identical twins raised together were less likely than fraternal (non-identical) twins to become twin sisters or brothers. However, when the twins were separated at birth and raised apart, there was no significant difference in their likelihood of becoming twin sisters and brothers. These findings suggest that genetic factors are important, but they are not the whole story. It is also important to recognize that environmental factors can play an important role in shaping a person’s characteristics and behaviors, just as they do in other areas of life. Environmental factors include families, friends, schools, neighborhoods, etc. Just as genetics can influence our behavior, so too can our experiences and interactions with the world around us.","{""sections"": [""Biopsychology/The Brain and Spinal Cord"", ""States of Consciousness/Sleep and Why We Sleep""], ""pages"": [""92"", ""95"", ""115""]}"

Take this assessment based on Cattell's 16PF questionnaire (http://openstax.org/l/cattell) to see which
personality traits dominate your personality.
Psychologists Hans and Sybil Eysenck were personality theorists (Figure 11.12) who focused on temperament,
the inborn, genetically based personality differences that you studied earlier in the chapter. They believed
personality is largely governed by biology. The Eysencks (Eysenck, 1990, 1992; Eysenck & Eysenck, 1963)
viewed people as having two specific personality dimensions: extroversion/introversion and neuroticism/
stability.

According to their theory, people high on the trait of extroversion are sociable and outgoing, and readily
connect with others, whereas people high on the trait of introversion have a higher need to be alone, engage in
solitary behaviors, and limit their interactions with others. In the neuroticism/stability dimension, people high
on neuroticism tend to be anxious; they tend to have an overactive sympathetic nervous system and, even with
low stress, their bodies and emotional state tend to go into a flight-or-fight reaction. In contrast, people high on
stability tend to need more stimulation to activate their flight-or-fight reaction and are considered more
emotionally stable. Based on these two dimensions, the Eysencks’ theory divides people into four quadrants.
These quadrants are sometimes compared with the four temperaments described by the Greeks: melancholic,
choleric, phlegmatic, and sanguine (Figure 11.13).
11.7 • Trait Theorists 381
FIGURE 11.13 The Eysencks described two factors to account for variations in our personalities: extroversion/
introversion and emotional stability/instability.
Later, the Eysencks added a third dimension: psychoticism versus superego control (Eysenck, Eysenck &
Barrett, 1985). In this dimension, people who are high on psychoticism tend to be independent thinkers, cold,
nonconformists, impulsive, antisocial, and hostile, whereas people who are high on superego control tend to
have high impulse control—they are more altruistic, empathetic, cooperative, and conventional (Eysenck,
Eysenck & Barrett, 1985).
While Cattell’s 16 factors may be too broad, the Eysenck’s two-factor system has been criticized for being too
narrow. Another personality theory, called the Five Factor Model, effectively hits a middle ground, with its five
factors referred to as the Big Five personality factors. It is the most popular theory in personality psychology
today and the most accurate approximation of the basic personality dimensions (Funder, 2001). The five
factors are openness to experience, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism (Figure
11.14). A helpful way to remember the factors is by using the mnemonic OCEAN.
In the Five Factor Model, each person has each factor, but they occur along a spectrum. Openness to
experience is characterized by imagination, feelings, actions, and ideas. People who score high on this factor
tend to be curious and have a wide range of interests. Conscientiousness is characterized by competence, self-
discipline, thoughtfulness, and achievement-striving (goal-directed behavior). People who score high on this
factor are hardworking and dependable. Numerous studies have found a positive correlation between
conscientiousness and academic success (Akomolafe, 2013; Chamorro-Premuzic & Furnham, 2008; Conrad &
Patry, 2012; Noftle & Robins, 2007; Wagerman & Funder, 2007). Extroversion is characterized by sociability,
assertiveness, excitement-seeking, and emotional expression. People who score high on this factor are usually
described as outgoing and warm. Not surprisingly, people who score high on both extroversion and openness
are more likely to participate in adventure and risky sports due to their curious and excitement-seeking nature
(Tok, 2011). The fourth factor is agreeableness, which is the tendency to be pleasant, cooperative, trustworthy,
and good-natured. People who score low on agreeableness tend to be described as rude and uncooperative, yet
one recent study reported that men who scored low on this factor actually earned more money than men who
were considered more agreeable (Judge, Livingston, & Hurst, 2012). The last of the Big Five factors is
382 11 • Personality
Access for free at openstax.org
neuroticism, which is the tendency to experience negative emotions. People high on neuroticism tend to
experience emotional instability and are characterized as angry, impulsive, and hostile. Watson and Clark
(1984) found that people reporting high levels of neuroticism also tend to report feeling anxious and unhappy.
In contrast, people who score low in neuroticism tend to be calm and even-tempered.
FIGURE 11.14 In the Five Factor Model, each person has five factors, each scored on a continuum from high to low.
In the center column, notice that the first letter of each factor spells the mnemonic OCEAN.
The Big Five personality factors each represent a range between two extremes. In reality, most of us tend to lie
somewhere midway along the continuum of each factor, rather than at polar ends. It’s important to note that
the Big Five factors are relatively stable over our lifespan, with some tendency for the factors to increase or
decrease slightly. Researchers have found that conscientiousness increases through young adulthood into
middle age, as we become better able to manage our personal relationships and careers (Donnellan & Lucas,
2008). Agreeableness also increases with age, peaking between 50 to 70 years (Terracciano, McCrae, Brant, &
Costa, 2005). Neuroticism and extroversion tend to decline slightly with age (Donnellan & Lucas; Terracciano
et al.). Additionally, The Big Five factors have been shown to exist across ethnicities, cultures, and ages, and
may have substantial biological and genetic components (Jang, Livesley, & Vernon, 1996; Jang et al., 2006;
McCrae & Costa, 1997; Schmitt et al., 2007).
Another model of personality traits is the HEXACO model. HEXACO is an acronym for six broad traits: honesty-
humility, emotionality, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience (Anglim &
O’Connor, 2018). Table 11.6 provides a brief overview of each trait.

11.8 Cultural Understandings of Personality
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section you should be able to:
• Discuss personality differences of people from collectivist and individualist cultures
• Discuss the three approaches to studying personality in a cultural context
As you have learned in this chapter, personality is shaped by both genetic and environmental factors. The
culture in which you live is one of the most important environmental factors that shapes your personality
(Triandis & Suh, 2002). The term culture refers to all of the beliefs, customs, art, and traditions of a particular
society. Culture is transmitted to people through language as well as through the modeling of culturally
acceptable and nonacceptable behaviors that are either rewarded or punished (Triandis & Suh, 2002). With
these ideas in mind, personality psychologists have become interested in the role of culture in understanding
personality. They ask whether personality traits are the same across cultures or if there are variations. It
appears that there are both universal and culture-specific aspects that account for variation in people’s
personalities.
Why might it be important to consider cultural influences on personality? Western ideas about personality
may not be applicable to other cultures (Benet-Martinez & Oishi, 2008). In fact, there is evidence that the
strength of personality traits varies across cultures. Let’s take a look at some of the Big Five factors
(conscientiousness, neuroticism, openness, and extroversion) across cultures. As you will learn when you
study social psychology, Asian cultures are more collectivist, and people in these cultures tend to be less
extroverted. People in Central and South American cultures tend to score higher on openness to experience,
whereas Europeans score higher on neuroticism (Benet-Martinez & Karakitapoglu-Aygun, 2003).
According to a study by Rentfrow and colleagues, there also seem to be regional personality differences within
the United States (Figure 11.15). Researchers analyzed responses from over 1.5 million individuals in the
United States and found that there are three distinct regional personality clusters: Cluster 1, which is in the
Upper Midwest and Deep South, is dominated by people who fall into the “friendly and conventional”
personality; Cluster 2, which includes the West, is dominated by people who are more relaxed, emotionally
384 11 • Personality
Access for free at openstax.org
stable, calm, and creative; and Cluster 3, which includes the Northeast, has more people who are stressed,
irritable, and depressed. People who live in Clusters 2 and 3 are also generally more open (Rentfrow et al.,
2013).
FIGURE 11.15 Researchers found three distinct regional personality clusters in the United States. People tend to be
friendly and conventional in the Upper Midwest and Deep South; relaxed, emotionally stable, and creative in the
West; and stressed, irritable, and depressed in the Northeast (Rentfrow et al., 2013).
One explanation for the regional differences is selective migration (Rentfrow et al., 2013). Selective migration
is the concept that people choose to move to places that are compatible with their personalities and needs. For
example, a person high on the agreeable scale would likely want to live near family and friends, and would
choose to settle or remain in such an area. In contrast, someone high on openness would prefer to settle in a
place that is recognized as diverse and innovative (such as California). Further, Rentfrow, Jost, Gosling, & Potter
(2009) noted an overlap between geographical regions and personality characteristics that goes beyond the
often-used explanations of religion, racial diversity, and education. Their research suggests that the
psychological profile of a region is closely related to that of its residents. They found that levels of openness
and conscientiousness in a state may predict voting patterns, indicating that there are correlations between
geographic regions and personality differences between liberals and conservatives relating to political views,
levels of economic vitality, and entrepreneurial rates.
Personality in Individualist and Collectivist Cultures
Individualist cultures and collectivist cultures place emphasis on different basic values. People who live in
individualist cultures tend to believe that independence, competition, and personal achievement are
important. Individuals in Western nations such as the United States, England, and Australia score high on
11.8 • Cultural Understandings of Personality 385
individualism (Oyserman, Coon, & Kemmelmier, 2002). People who live in collectivist cultures value social
harmony, respectfulness, and group needs over individual needs. Individuals who live in countries in Asia,
Africa, and South America score high on collectivism (Hofstede, 2001; Triandis, 1995). These values influence
personality. For example, Yang (2006) found that people in individualist cultures displayed more personally
oriented personality traits, whereas people in collectivist cultures displayed more socially oriented personality
traits. Frewer and Bleus (1991) conducted a study of the Eysenk Personality Inventory in a collectivist culture
using Papua New Guinean university students. They found that the results of the personality inventory were
only relevant when analyzed within the context of a collectivist society. Similarly, Dana (1986) suggested that
personality assessment services for Native Americans are often provided without a proper recognition of
culture-specific responses and a tribe-specific frame of reference. Assessors need to have more than a general
knowledge of history, tribal differences, contemporary culture on reservations, and levels of acculturation in
order to interpret psychological test responses with a minimal bias.
Approaches to Studying Personality in a Cultural Context
There are three approaches that can be used to study personality in a cultural context, the cultural-
comparative approach; the indigenous approach; and the combined approach, which incorporates elements of
both views. Since ideas about personality have a Western basis, the cultural-comparative approach seeks to
test Western ideas about personality in other cultures to determine whether they can be generalized and if
they have cultural validity (Cheung van de Vijver, & Leong, 2011). For example, recall from the previous section
on the trait perspective that researchers used the cultural-comparative approach to test the universality of
McCrae and Costa’s Five Factor Model. They found applicability in numerous cultures around the world, with
the Big Five factors being stable in many cultures (McCrae & Costa, 1997; McCrae et al., 2005). The indigenous
approach came about in reaction to the dominance of Western approaches to the study of personality in non-
Western settings (Cheung et al., 2011). Because Western-based personality assessments cannot fully capture
the personality constructs of other cultures, the indigenous model has led to the development of personality
assessment instruments that are based on constructs relevant to the culture being studied (Cheung et al.,
2011). The third approach to cross-cultural studies of personality is the combined approach, which serves as a
bridge between Western and indigenous psychology as a way of understanding both universal and cultural
variations in personality (Cheung et al., 2011).
11.9 Personality Assessment
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Discuss the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory
• Recognize and describe common projective tests used in personality assessment
Roberto, Mikhail, and Nat are college friends and all want to be police officers. Roberto is quiet and shy, lacks
self-confidence, and usually follows others. He is a kind person, but lacks motivation. Mikhail is loud and
boisterous, a leader. He works hard, but is impulsive and drinks too much on the weekends. Nat is thoughtful
and well liked. They are trustworthy, but are very methodical and therefore have difficulty making quick
decisions. Of these three, who would make the best police officer? What qualities and personality factors make
someone a good police officer? What makes someone a bad or dangerous police officer?
A police officer’s job is very high in stress, and law enforcement agencies want to make sure they hire the right
people. Personality testing is often used for this purpose—to screen applicants for employment and job
training. Personality tests are also used in criminal cases and custody battles, and to assess psychological
disorders. This section explores the best known among the many different types of personality tests.
Self-Report Inventories
Self-report inventories are a kind of objective test used to assess personality. They typically use multiple-
choice items or numbered scales, which represent a range from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).

In contrast, stable people tend to be less anxious and more relaxed. People with a high level of extraversion and low levels of anxiety are called extroverts, while people with high levels anxiety and a low need for social interaction are classified as introverts. Extroverted and introverted people differ from each other in a number of ways. For example, they differ in their attitudes toward stress. Introverts are more sensitive to stress and are less able to cope with stressful situations. They are also more likely to withdraw from social situations. On the other hand, extraverts are generally more tolerant of stress because they are not as easily overwhelmed by it. Extraverted individuals may be more prone to feeling stressed out, but they can also be better at coping with stress. In addition to these personality characteristics, there are several other traits that can be used to classify people into different personality types. Some of these traits include openness to experience, conscientiousness, agreeableness, and emotional stability. These traits can help you determine which personality type you are and how you can use your strengths and weaknesses to become a better person.

The most widely used personality test is the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). The MBTI was developed by Carl R.

Preface 1
28. Describe how social support can affect health both directly and indirectly.
29. In considering the three dimensions of happiness discussed in this section (the pleasant life, the good life,
and the meaningful life), what are some steps you could take to improve your personal level of happiness?
30. The day before the drawing of a $300 million Powerball lottery, you notice that a line of people waiting to
buy their Powerball tickets is stretched outside the door of a nearby convenience store. Based on what
you’ve learned, provide some perspective on why these people are doing this, and what would likely
happen if one of these individuals happened to pick the right numbers.
Personal Application Questions
31. Think of a time in which you and others you know (family members, friends, and classmates) experienced
an event that some viewed as threatening and others viewed as challenging. What were some of the
differences in the reactions of those who experienced the event as threatening compared to those who
viewed the event as challenging? Why do you think there were differences in how these individuals judged
the same event?
32. Suppose you want to design a study to examine the relationship between stress and illness, but you cannot
use the Social Readjustment Rating Scale. How would you go about measuring stress? How would you
measure illness? What would you need to do in order to tell if there is a cause-effect relationship between
stress and illness?
33. If a family member or friend of yours has asthma, talk to that person (if they are willing) about their
symptom triggers. Does this person mention stress or emotional states? If so, are there any commonalities
in these asthma triggers?
34. Try to think of an example in which you coped with a particular stressor by using problem-focused
coping. What was the stressor? What did your problem-focused efforts involve? Were they effective?
35. Think of an activity you participate in that you find engaging and absorbing. For example, this might be
something like playing video games, reading, or a hobby. What are your experiences typically like while
engaging in this activity? Do your experiences conform to the notion of flow? If so, how? Do you think these
experiences have enriched your life? Why or why not?

On Monday, September 16, 2013, a gunman killed 12 people as the workday began at the
Washington Navy Yard in Washington, DC. Aaron Alexis, 34, had a troubled history: he thought that he was
being controlled by radio waves. He called the police to complain about voices in his head and being under
surveillance by “shadowy forces” (Thomas, Levine, Date, & Cloherty, 2013). While Alexis’s actions cannot be
excused, it is clear that he had some form of mental illness. Mental illness is not necessarily a cause of
violence; it is far more likely that the mentally ill will be victims rather than perpetrators of violence (Stuart,
2003). If, however, Alexis had received the help he needed, this tragedy might have been averted.

15.1 What Are Psychological Disorders?
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Understand the problems inherent in defining the concept of psychological disorder
• Describe what is meant by harmful dysfunction
• Identify the formal criteria that thoughts, feelings, and behaviors must meet to be considered abnormal and,
thus, symptomatic of a psychological disorder
According to the American Psychiatric Association, a psychological disorder, or mental disorder, is “a
syndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotion regulation,
or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological, or developmental processes underlying
mental functioning. Mental disorders are usually associated with significant distress in social, occupational, or
other important activities” (2013). Psychopathology is the study of psychological disorders, including their
symptoms, etiology (i.e., their causes), and treatment. The term psychopathology can also refer to the
manifestation of a psychological disorder. Although consensus can be difficult, it is extremely important for
mental health professionals to agree on what kinds of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are truly abnormal in
the sense that they genuinely indicate the presence of psychopathology. Certain patterns of behavior and inner
experience can easily be labeled as abnormal and clearly signify some kind of psychological disturbance. The
person who washes their hands 40 times per day and the person who claims to hear the voices of demons
exhibit behaviors and inner experiences that most would regard as abnormal: beliefs and behaviors that
suggest the existence of a psychological disorder. But, consider the nervousness a young man feels when
talking to an attractive person or the loneliness and longing for home a first-year student experiences during
her first semester of college—these feelings may not be regularly present, but they fall in the range of normal.
So, what kinds of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors represent a true psychological disorder? Psychologists work
to distinguish psychological disorders from inner experiences and behaviors that are merely situational,
idiosyncratic, or unconventional.
Mental health issues are often incorrectly viewed as less important than physical illnesses, and sometimes
people are blamed or otherwise stigmatized for their condition. People with mental illnesses did not choose or
create their illness, and cannot simply manage it through positive thinking or other attitudinal changes.
Diagnosis, treatment, and support are all necessary, and all must be considered with respect and sensitivity to
the extremely challenging nature of mental illness. While not everyone experiencing difficulty has a
psychological disorder, mental health is critical to our ability to function in our relationships, education, and
work. It is important that people talk with qualified professionals if they are having persistent feelings or
experiences in line with the descriptions below; the discussion may or may not lead to a diagnosis, but as with
physical illnesses, one has a better chance at success if they raise the issues with doctors or other experts.
Definition of a Psychological Disorder
Perhaps the simplest approach to conceptualizing psychological disorders is to label behaviors, thoughts, and
inner experiences that are atypical, distressful, dysfunctional, and sometimes even dangerous, as signs of a
disorder. For example, if you ask a classmate for a date and you are rejected, you probably would feel a little
dejected. Such feelings would be normal. If you felt extremely depressed—so much so that you lost interest in
activities, had difficulty eating or sleeping, felt utterly worthless, and contemplated suicide—your feelings
would be atypical, would deviate from the norm, and could signify the presence of a psychological disorder.
Just because something is atypical, however, does not necessarily mean it is disordered.
For example, only about 4% of people in the United States have red hair, so red hair is considered an atypical
characteristic (Figure 15.2), but it is not considered disordered, it’s just unusual. And it is less unusual in
Scotland, where approximately 13% of the population has red hair (“DNA Project Aims,” 2012). As you will
learn, some disorders, although not exactly typical, are far from atypical, and the rates in which they appear in
the population are surprisingly high.

Cross are three natural redheads. (credit a: modification of work by Richard Goldschmidt; credit b: modification of
work by Glyn Lowe; credit c: modification of work by Kirk Weaver)
If we can agree that merely being atypical is an insufficient criterion for a having a psychological disorder, is it
reasonable to consider behavior or inner experiences that differ from widely expected cultural values or
expectations as disordered? Using this criterion, a person who walks around a subway platform wearing a
heavy winter coat in July while screaming obscenities at strangers may be considered as exhibiting symptoms
of a psychological disorder. Their actions and clothes violate socially accepted rules governing appropriate
dress and behavior; these characteristics are atypical.
Cultural Expectations
Violating cultural expectations is not, in and of itself, a satisfactory means of identifying the presence of a
psychological disorder. Since behavior varies from one culture to another, what may be expected and
considered appropriate in one culture may not be viewed as such in other cultures. For example, returning a
stranger’s smile is expected in the United States because a pervasive social norm dictates that we reciprocate
friendly gestures. A person who refuses to acknowledge such gestures might be considered socially
awkward—perhaps even disordered—for violating this expectation. However, such expectations are not
universally shared. Cultural expectations in Japan involve showing reserve, restraint, and a concern for
maintaining privacy around strangers. Japanese people are generally unresponsive to smiles from strangers
(Patterson et al., 2007). Eye contact provides another example. In the United States and Europe, eye contact
with others typically signifies honesty and attention. However, most Latin-American, Asian, and African
cultures interpret direct eye contact as rude, confrontational, and aggressive (Pazain, 2010). Thus, someone
who makes eye contact with you could be considered appropriate and respectful or brazen and offensive,
depending on your culture (Figure 15.3).
FIGURE 15.3 Eye contact is one of many social gestures that vary from culture to culture. (credit: Joi Ito)
Hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not physically present) in Western societies is a violation of
15.1 • What Are Psychological Disorders? 539
cultural expectations, and a person who reports such inner experiences is readily labeled as psychologically
disordered. In other cultures, visions that, for example, pertain to future events may be regarded as normal
experiences that are positively valued (Bourguignon, 1970). Finally, it is important to recognize that cultural
norms change over time: what might be considered typical in a society at one time may no longer be viewed
this way later, similar to how fashion trends from one era may elicit quizzical looks decades later—imagine how
a headband, legwarmers, and the big hair of the 1980s would go over on your campus today.
The Myth of Mental Illness
In the 1950s and 1960s, the concept of mental illness was widely criticized. One of the major criticisms focused
on the notion that mental illness was a “myth that justifies psychiatric intervention in socially disapproved
behavior” (Wakefield, 1992). Thomas Szasz (1960), a noted psychiatrist, was perhaps the biggest proponent of
this view. Szasz argued that the notion of mental illness was invented by society (and the mental health
establishment) to stigmatize and subjugate people whose behavior violates accepted social and legal norms.
Indeed, Szasz suggested that what appear to be symptoms of mental illness are more appropriately
characterized as “problems in living” (Szasz, 1960).
In his 1961 book, The Myth of Mental Illness: Foundations of a Theory of Personal Conduct, Szasz expressed his
disdain for the concept of mental illness and for the field of psychiatry in general (Oliver, 2006). The basis for
Szasz’s attack was his contention that detectable abnormalities in bodily structures and functions (e.g.,
infections and organ damage or dysfunction) represent the defining features of genuine illness or disease, and
because symptoms of purported mental illness are not accompanied by such detectable abnormalities, so-called
psychological disorders are not disorders at all. Szasz (1961/2010) proclaimed that “disease or illness can only
affect the body; hence, there can be no mental illness” (p. 267).
Today, we recognize the extreme level of psychological suffering experienced by people with psychological
disorders: the painful thoughts and feelings they experience, the disordered behavior they demonstrate, and the
levels of distress and impairment they exhibit. This makes it very difficult to deny the reality of mental illness.
However controversial Szasz’s views and those of his supporters might have been, they have influenced the
mental health community and society in several ways. First, lay people, politicians, and professionals now often
refer to mental illness as mental health “problems,” implicitly acknowledging the “problems in living”
perspective Szasz described (Buchanan-Barker & Barker, 2009). Also influential was Szasz’s view of sexual
orientation. Szasz was perhaps the first psychiatrist to openly challenge the idea that same-sex attraction
represented a form of mental illness or disease (Szasz, 1965), which helped pave the way for the social and civil
rights that gay and lesbian people now have (Barker, 2010). His work also inspired legal changes that protect the
rights of people in psychiatric institutions and allow such individuals a greater degree of influence and
responsibility over their lives (Buchanan-Barker & Barker, 2009).
Harmful Dysfunction
If none of the criterion discussed so far is adequate by itself to define the presence of a psychological disorder,
how can a disorder be conceptualized? Many efforts have been made to identify the specific dimensions of
psychological disorders, yet none is entirely satisfactory. No universal definition of psychological disorder
exists that can apply to all situations in which a disorder is thought to be present (Zachar & Kendler, 2007).
However, one of the more influential conceptualizations was proposed by Wakefield (1992), who defined
psychological disorder as a harmful dysfunction. Wakefield argued that natural internal mechanisms—that is,
psychological processes honed by evolution, such as cognition, perception, and learning—have important
functions, such as enabling us to experience the world the way others do and to engage in rational thought,
problem solving, and communication. For example, learning allows us to associate a fear with a potential

how can a disorder be conceptualized? Many efforts have been made to identify the specific dimensions of

danger in such a way that the intensity of fear is roughly equal to the degree of actual danger. Dysfunction
occurs when an internal mechanism breaks down and can no longer perform its normal function. But, the
presence of a dysfunction by itself does not determine a disorder. The dysfunction must be harmful in that it
leads to negative consequences for the individual or for others, as judged by the standards of the individual’s
culture. The harm may include significant internal anguish (e.g., high levels of anxiety or depression) or
problems in day-to-day living (e.g., in one’s social or work life).
To illustrate, Janet has an extreme fear of spiders. Janet’s fear might be considered a dysfunction in that it
signals that the internal mechanism of learning is not working correctly (i.e., a faulty process prevents Janet
from appropriately associating the magnitude of fear with the actual threat posed by spiders). Janet’s fear of
spiders has a significant negative influence on daily life: she avoids all situations in which she suspects spiders
to be present (e.g., the basement or a friend’s home), and she quit her job last month because she saw a spider
in the restroom at work and is now unemployed. According to the harmful dysfunction model, Janet’s
condition would signify a disorder because (a) there is a dysfunction in an internal mechanism, and (b) the
dysfunction has resulted in harmful consequences. Similar to how the symptoms of physical illness reflect
dysfunctions in biological processes, the symptoms of psychological disorders presumably reflect
dysfunctions in mental processes. The internal mechanism component of this model is especially appealing
because it implies that disorders may occur through a breakdown of biological functions that govern various
psychological processes, thus supporting contemporary neurobiological models of psychological disorders
(Fabrega, 2007).
The American Psychiatric Association (APA) Definition
Many of the features of the harmful dysfunction model are incorporated in a formal definition of psychological
disorder developed by the American Psychiatric Association (APA). According to the APA (2013), a
psychological disorder is a condition that is said to consist of the following:
• There are significant disturbances in thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. A person must experience
inner states (e.g., thoughts and/or feelings) and exhibit behaviors that are clearly disturbed—that is,
unusual, but in a negative, self-defeating way. Often, such disturbances are troubling to those around the
individual who experiences them. For example, an individual who is uncontrollably preoccupied by
thoughts of germs spends hours each day bathing, has inner experiences, and displays behaviors that
most would consider atypical and negative (disturbed) and that would likely be troubling to family
members.
• The disturbances reflect some kind of biological, psychological, or developmental dysfunction.
Disturbed patterns of inner experiences and behaviors should reflect some flaw (dysfunction) in the
internal biological, psychological, and developmental mechanisms that lead to normal, healthy
psychological functioning. For example, the hallucinations observed in schizophrenia could be a sign of
brain abnormalities.
• The disturbances lead to significant distress or disability in one’s life. A person’s inner experiences and
behaviors are considered to reflect a psychological disorder if they cause the person considerable distress,
or greatly impair their ability to function as a normal individual (often referred to as functional
impairment, or occupational and social impairment). As an illustration, a person’s fear of social situations
might be so distressing that it causes the person to avoid all social situations (e.g., preventing that person
from being able to attend class or apply for a job).
• The disturbances do not reflect expected or culturally approved responses to certain events.
Disturbances in thoughts, feelings, and behaviors must be socially unacceptable responses to certain
events that often happen in life. For example, it is perfectly natural (and expected) that a person would
experience great sadness and might wish to be left alone following the death of a close family member.
Because such reactions are in some ways culturally expected, the individual would not be assumed to
signify a mental disorder.
15.1 • What Are Psychological Disorders? 541
Some believe that there is no essential criterion or set of criteria that can definitively distinguish all cases of
disorder from nondisorder (Lilienfeld & Marino, 1999). In truth, no single approach to defining a psychological
disorder is adequate by itself, nor is there universal agreement on where the boundary is between disordered
and not disordered. From time to time we all experience anxiety, unwanted thoughts, and moments of
sadness; our behavior at other times may not make much sense to ourselves or to others. These inner
experiences and behaviors can vary in their intensity, but are only considered disordered when they are highly
disturbing to us and/or others, suggest a dysfunction in normal mental functioning, and are associated with
significant distress or disability in social or occupational activities.
15.2 Diagnosing and Classifying Psychological Disorders
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Explain why classification systems are necessary in the study of psychopathology
• Describe the basic features of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)
• Discuss changes in the DSM over time, including criticisms of the current edition
• Identify which disorders are generally the most common
A first step in the study of psychological disorders is carefully and systematically discerning significant signs
and symptoms. How do mental health professionals ascertain whether or not a person’s inner states and
behaviors truly represent a psychological disorder? Arriving at a proper diagnosis—that is, appropriately
identifying and labeling a set of defined symptoms—is absolutely crucial. This process enables professionals to
use a common language with others in the field and aids in communication about the disorder with the
patient, colleagues and the public. A proper diagnosis is an essential element to guide proper and successful
treatment. For these reasons, classification systems that organize psychological disorders systematically are
necessary.
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)
Although a number of classification systems have been developed over time, the one that is used by most
mental health professionals in the United States is the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association (2013). (Note that the American Psychiatric
Association differs from the American Psychological Association; both are abbreviated APA.) The first edition
of the DSM, published in 1952, classified psychological disorders according to a format developed by the U.S.
Army during World War II (Clegg, 2012). In the years since, the DSM has undergone numerous revisions and
editions. The most recent edition, published in 2013, is the DSM-5 (APA, 2013). The DSM-5 includes many
categories of disorders (e.g., anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, and dissociative disorders). Each
disorder is described in detail, including an overview of the disorder (diagnostic features), specific symptoms
required for diagnosis (diagnostic criteria), prevalence information (what percent of the population is thought
to be afflicted with the disorder), and risk factors associated with the disorder. Figure 15.4 shows lifetime
prevalence rates—the percentage of people in a population who develop a disorder in their lifetime—of various
psychological disorders among U.S. adults. These data were based on a national sample of 9,282 U.S. residents
(National Comorbidity Survey, 2007).

FIGURE 15.4 The graph shows the breakdown of psychological disorders, comparing the percentage prevalence
among adult males and adult females in the United States. Because the data is from 2007, the categories shown
here are from the DSM-IV, which has been supplanted by the DSM-5. Most categories remain the same; however,
alcohol abuse now falls under a broader Alcohol Use Disorder category.
The DSM-5 also provides information about comorbidity; the co-occurrence of two disorders. For example, the
DSM-5 mentions that 41% of people with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) also meet the diagnostic
criteria for major depressive disorder (Figure 15.5). Problematic substance use is highly comorbid with other
mental illnesses; 6 out of 10 people who have a substance use disorder also suffer from another form of mental
illness (National Institute on Drug Abuse [NIDA], 2007).
FIGURE 15.5 Obsessive-compulsive disorder and major depressive disorder frequently occur in the same person.
Comorbidity
As you’ve learned in the text, comorbidity refers to situations in which an individual suffers from more than one
disorder, and often the symptoms of each can interact in negative ways. Co-occurrence and comorbidity of
psychological disorders are quite common, and some of the most pervasive comorbidities involve substance use
disorders that co-occur with psychological disorders. Indeed, some estimates suggest that around a quarter of
CONNECT THE CONCEPTS
15.2 • Diagnosing and Classifying Psychological Disorders 543
people who suffer from the most severe cases of mental illness exhibit substance use disorder as well. Conversely,
around 10 percent of individuals seeking treatment for substance use disorder have serious mental illnesses.
Observations such as these have important implications for treatment options that are available. When people with
a mental illness are also habitual drug users, their symptoms can be exacerbated and resistant to treatment.
Furthermore, it is not always clear whether the symptoms are due to drug use, the mental illness, or a combination
of the two. Therefore, it is recommended that behavior is observed in situations in which the individual has ceased
using drugs and is no longer experiencing withdrawal from the drug in order to make the most accurate diagnosis
(NIDA, 2018).
Obviously, substance use disorders are not the only possible comorbidities. In fact, some of the most common
psychological disorders tend to co-occur. For instance, more than half of individuals who have a primary diagnosis of
depressive disorder are estimated to exhibit some sort of anxiety disorder. The reverse is also true for those
diagnosed with a primary diagnosis of an anxiety disorder. Further, anxiety disorders and major depression have a
high rate of comorbidity with several other psychological disorders (Al-Asadi, Klein, & Meyer, 2015).
The DSM has changed considerably in the half-century since it was originally published. The first two editions
of the DSM, for example, listed homosexuality as a disorder; however, in 1973, the APA voted to remove it from
the manual (Silverstein, 2009). While the DSM-III did not list homosexuality as a disorder, it introduced a new
diagnosis, ego-dystonic homosexuality, which emphasized same-sex arousal that the patient viewed as
interfering with desired heterosexual relationships and causing distress for the individual. This new diagnosis
was considered by many as a compromise to appease those who viewed homosexuality as a mental illness.
Other professionals questioned how appropriate it was to have a separate diagnosis that described the content
of an individual's distress. In 1986, the diagnosis was removed from the DSM-III-R (Herek, 2012). Additionally,
beginning with the DSM-III in 1980, mental disorders have been described in much greater detail, and the
number of diagnosable conditions has grown steadily, as has the size of the manual itself. DSM-I included 106
diagnoses and was 130 total pages, whereas DSM-III included more than 2 times as many diagnoses (265) and
was nearly seven times its size (886 total pages) (Mayes & Horowitz, 2005). Although DSM-5 is longer than
DSM-IV, the volume includes only 237 disorders, a decrease from the 297 disorders that were listed in DSM-IV.
The latest edition, DSM-5, includes revisions in the organization and naming of categories and in the
diagnostic criteria for various disorders (Regier, Kuhl, & Kupfer, 2012), while emphasizing careful
consideration of the importance of gender and cultural difference in the expression of various symptoms
(Fisher, 2010).
Some believe that establishing new diagnoses might overpathologize the human condition by turning common
human problems into mental illnesses (The Associated Press, 2013). Indeed, the finding that nearly half of all
Americans will meet the criteria for a DSM disorder at some point in their life (Kessler et al., 2005) likely fuels
much of this skepticism. The DSM-5 is also criticized on the grounds that its diagnostic criteria have been
loosened, thereby threatening to “turn our current diagnostic inflation into diagnostic hyperinflation”
(Frances, 2012, para. 22). For example, DSM-IV specified that the symptoms of major depressive disorder must
not be attributable to normal bereavement (loss of a loved one). The DSM-5, however, has removed this
bereavement exclusion, essentially meaning that grief and sadness after a loved one’s death can constitute
major depressive disorder.
The International Classification of Diseases
A second classification system, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), is also widely recognized.
Published by the World Health Organization (WHO), the ICD was developed in Europe shortly after World War
II and, like the DSM, has been revised several times. The categories of psychological disorders in both the DSM
and ICD are similar, as are the criteria for specific disorders; however, some differences exist. Although the ICD
is used for clinical purposes, this tool is also used to examine the general health of populations and to monitor
the prevalence of diseases and other health problems internationally (WHO, 2013). The ICD is in its 10th
544 15 • Psychological Disorders
Access for free at openstax.org
edition (ICD-10); however, efforts are now underway to develop a new edition (ICD-11) that, in conjunction with
the changes in DSM-5, will help harmonize the two classification systems as much as possible (APA, 2013).
A study that compared the use of the two classification systems found that worldwide the ICD is more
frequently used for clinical diagnosis, whereas the DSM is more valued for research (Mezzich, 2002). Most
research findings concerning the etiology and treatment of psychological disorders are based on criteria set
forth in the DSM (Oltmanns & Castonguay, 2013). The DSM also includes more explicit disorder criteria, along
with an extensive and helpful explanatory text (Regier et al., 2012). The DSM is the classification system of
choice among U.S. mental health professionals, and this chapter is based on the DSM paradigm.
The Compassionate View of Psychological Disorders
As these disorders are outlined, please bear two things in mind. First, remember that psychological disorders
represent extremes of inner experience and behavior. If, while reading about these disorders, you feel that
these descriptions begin to personally characterize you, do not worry—this moment of enlightenment probably
means nothing more than you have had a range of experiences and emotions. Each of us experiences episodes
of sadness, anxiety, and preoccupation with certain thoughts—times when we do not quite feel ourselves.
These episodes should not be considered problematic unless the accompanying thoughts and behaviors
become extreme and have a disruptive effect on one’s life. Second, understand that people with psychological
disorders are far more than just embodiments of their disorders. We do not use terms such as schizophrenics,
depressives, or phobics because they are labels that objectify people who have these conditions, thus
promoting biased and disparaging assumptions about them. It is important to remember that a psychological
disorder is not what a person is; it is something that a person has—through no fault of their own. As is the case
with cancer or diabetes, those with psychological disorders suffer debilitating, often painful conditions that are
not of their own choosing. These individuals deserve to be viewed and treated with compassion,
understanding, and dignity.
15.3 Perspectives on Psychological Disorders
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Discuss supernatural perspectives on the origin of psychological disorders, in their historical context
• Describe modern biological and psychological perspectives on the origin of psychological disorders
• Identify which disorders generally show the highest degree of heritability
• Describe the diathesis-stress model and its importance to the study of psychopathology
Scientists, mental health professionals, and cultural healers may adopt different perspectives in attempting to
understand or explain the underlying mechanisms that contribute to the development of a psychological
disorder. The specific perspective used in explaining a psychological disorder is extremely important. Each
perspective explains psychological disorders, their causes or etiology, and effective treatments from a different
viewpoint. Different perspectives provide alternate ways for how to think about the nature of psychopathology.
Supernatural Perspectives of Psychological Disorders
For centuries, psychological disorders were viewed from a supernatural perspective: attributed to a force
beyond scientific understanding. Those afflicted were thought to be practitioners of black magic or possessed
by spirits (Figure 15.6) (Maher & Maher, 1985). For example, convents throughout Europe in the 16th and 17th
centuries reported hundreds of nuns falling into a state of frenzy in which the afflicted foamed at the mouth,
screamed and convulsed, sexually propositioned priests, and confessed to having carnal relations with devils
or Christ. Although, today, these cases would suggest serious mental illness; at the time, these events were
routinely explained as possession by devilish forces (Waller, 2009a). Similarly, grievous fits by young girls are
believed to have precipitated the witch panic in New England late in the 17th century (Demos, 1983). Such
beliefs in supernatural causes of mental illness are still held in some societies today; for example, beliefs that
supernatural forces cause mental illness are common in some cultures in modern-day Nigeria (Aghukwa,
15.3 • Perspectives on Psychological Disorders 545
2012).
FIGURE 15.6 In The Extraction of the Stone of Madness, a 15th century painting by Hieronymus Bosch, a
practitioner is using a tool to extract an object (the supposed “stone of madness”) from the head of an afflicted
person.
Dancing Mania
Between the 11th and 17th centuries, a curious epidemic swept across Western Europe. Groups of people would
suddenly begin to dance with wild abandon. This compulsion to dance—referred to as dancing
mania—sometimes gripped thousands of people at a time (Figure 15.7). Historical accounts indicate that those
afflicted would sometimes dance with bruised and bloody feet for days or weeks, screaming of terrible visions
and begging priests and monks to save their souls (Waller, 2009b). What caused dancing mania is not known, but
several explanations have been proposed, including spider venom and ergot poisoning (“Dancing Mania,” 2011).
FIGURE 15.7 Although the cause of dancing mania, depicted in this painting, was unclear, the behavior was
attributed to supernatural forces.
Historian John Waller (2009a, 2009b) has provided a comprehensive and convincing explanation of dancing
mania that suggests the phenomenon was attributable to a combination of three factors: psychological distress,
social contagion, and belief in supernatural forces. Waller argued that various disasters of the time (such as
famine, plagues, and floods) produced high levels of psychological distress that could increase the likelihood of
DIG DEEPER

succumbing to an involuntary trance state. Waller indicated that anthropological studies and accounts of
possession rituals show that people are more likely to enter a trance state if they expect it to happen, and that
entranced individuals behave in a ritualistic manner, their thoughts and behavior shaped by the spiritual beliefs
of their culture. Thus, during periods of extreme physical and mental distress, all it took were a few
people—believing themselves to have been afflicted with a dancing curse—to slip into a spontaneous trance and
then act out the part of one who is cursed by dancing for days on end.
Biological Perspectives of Psychological Disorders
The biological perspective views psychological disorders as linked to biological phenomena, such as genetic
factors, chemical imbalances, and brain abnormalities; it has gained considerable attention and acceptance in
recent decades (Wyatt & Midkiff, 2006). Evidence from many sources indicates that most psychological
disorders have a genetic component; in fact, there is little dispute that some disorders are largely due to
genetic factors. The graph in Figure 15.8 shows heritability estimates for schizophrenia.
FIGURE 15.8 A person’s risk of developing schizophrenia increases if a relative has schizophrenia. The closer the
genetic relationship, the higher the risk.
Findings such as these have led many of today’s researchers to search for specific genes and genetic mutations
that contribute to mental disorders. Also, sophisticated neural imaging technology in recent decades has
revealed how abnormalities in brain structure and function might be directly involved in many disorders, and
advances in our understanding of neurotransmitters and hormones have yielded insights into their possible
connections. The biological perspective is currently thriving in the study of psychological disorders.
The Diathesis-Stress Model of Psychological Disorders
Despite advances in understanding the biological basis of psychological disorders, the psychosocial
perspective is still very important. This perspective emphasizes the importance of learning, stress, faulty and
self-defeating thinking patterns, and environmental factors. Perhaps the best way to think about psychological
disorders, then, is to view them as originating from a combination of biological and psychological processes.
Many develop not from a single cause, but from a delicate fusion between partly biological and partly
psychosocial factors.
The diathesis-stress model (Zuckerman, 1999) integrates biological and psychosocial factors to predict the
likelihood of a disorder. This diathesis-stress model suggests that people with an underlying predisposition for
15.3 • Perspectives on Psychological Disorders 547
in the above studies were diagnosed. Studies that include more recent outcomes show positive effects of
treatment as opposed to non-treatment (Harpin, 2013; Arnold 2015). In most cases, the same studies indicate
that more research and work needs to be undertaken to understand the most effect treatments and their
impacts.
Causes of ADHD
Family and twin studies indicate that genetics play a significant role in the development of ADHD. Burt (2009),
in a review of 26 studies, reported that the median rate of concordance for identical twins was .66 (one study
reported a rate of .90), whereas the median concordance rate for fraternal twins was .20. This study also found
that the median concordance rate for unrelated (adoptive) siblings was .09; although this number is small, it is
greater than 0, thus suggesting that the environment may have at least some influence. Another review of
studies concluded that the heritability of inattention and hyperactivity were 71% and 73%, respectively
(Nikolas & Burt, 2010).
The specific genes involved in ADHD are thought to include at least two that are important in the regulation of
the neurotransmitter dopamine (Gizer, Ficks, & Waldman, 2009), suggesting that dopamine may be important
in ADHD. Indeed, medications used in the treatment of ADHD, such as methylphenidate (Ritalin) and
amphetamine with dextroamphetamine (Adderall), have stimulant qualities and elevate dopamine activity.
People with ADHD show less dopamine activity in key regions of the brain, especially those associated with
motivation and reward (Volkow et al., 2009), which provides support to the theory that dopamine deficits may
be a vital factor in the development this disorder (Swanson et al., 2007).
Brain imaging studies have shown that children with ADHD exhibit abnormalities in their frontal lobes, an area
in which dopamine is in abundance. Compared to children without ADHD, those with ADHD appear to have
smaller frontal lobe volume, and they show less frontal lobe activation when performing mental tasks. Recall
that one of the functions of the frontal lobes is to inhibit our behavior. Thus, abnormalities in this region may
go a long way toward explaining the hyperactive, uncontrolled behavior of ADHD.
By the 1970s, many had become aware of the connection between nutritional factors and childhood behavior.
At the time, much of the public believed that hyperactivity was caused by sugar and food additives, such as
artificial coloring and flavoring. Undoubtedly, part of the appeal of this hypothesis was that it provided a
simple explanation of (and treatment for) behavioral problems in children. A statistical review of 16 studies,
however, concluded that sugar consumption has no effect at all on the behavioral and cognitive performance of
children (Wolraich, Wilson, & White, 1995). Additionally, although food additives have been shown to increase
hyperactivity in non-ADHD children, the effect is rather small (McCann et al., 2007). Numerous studies,
however, have shown a significant relationship between exposure to nicotine in cigarette smoke during the
prenatal period and ADHD (Linnet et al., 2003). Maternal smoking during pregnancy is associated with the
development of more severe symptoms of the disorder (Thakur et al., 2013).
Is ADHD caused by poor parenting? No. Remember, the genetics studies discussed above suggested that the
family environment does not seem to play much of a role in the development of this disorder; if it did, we
would expect the concordance rates to be higher for fraternal twins and adoptive siblings than has been
demonstrated. All things considered, the evidence seems to point to the conclusion that ADHD is triggered
more by genetic and neurological factors and less by social or environmental ones.
Why Is the Prevalence Rate of ADHD Increasing?
Many people believe that the rates of ADHD have increased in recent years, and there is evidence to support this
contention. In a recent study, investigators found that the parent-reported prevalence of ADHD among children
(4–17 years old) in the United States increased by 22% during a 4-year period, from 7.8% in 2003 to 9.5% in
DIG DEEPER
578 15 • Psychological Disorders
Access for free at openstax.org
2007 (CDC, 2010). Over time this increase in parent-reported ADHD was observed in all sociodemographic
groups and was reflected by substantial increases in 12 states (Indiana, North Carolina, and Colorado were the
top three). The increases were greatest for older teens (ages 15–17), multiracial and Hispanic children, and
children with a primary language other than English. Another investigation found that from 1998–2000 through
2007–2009 the parent-reported prevalence of ADHD increased among U.S. children between the ages of 5–17
years old, from 6.9% to 9.0% (Akinbami, Liu, Pastor, & Reuben, 2011).
A major weakness of both studies was that children were not actually given a formal diagnosis. Instead, parents
were simply asked whether or not a doctor or other health-care provider had ever told them their child had
ADHD; the reported prevalence rates thus may have been affected by the accuracy of parental memory.
Nevertheless, the findings from these studies raise important questions concerning what appears to be a
demonstrable rise in the prevalence of ADHD. Although the reasons underlying this apparent increase in the
rates of ADHD over time are poorly understood and, at best, speculative, several explanations are viable:
• ADHD may be over-diagnosed by doctors who are too quick to medicate children as a behavior treatment.
• There is greater awareness of ADHD now than in the past. Nearly everyone has heard of ADHD, and most
parents and teachers are aware of its key symptoms. Thus, parents may be quick to take their children to a
doctor if they believe their child possesses these symptoms, or teachers may be more likely now than in the
past to notice the symptoms and refer the child for evaluation.
• The use of computers, video games, iPhones, and other electronic devices has become pervasive among
children in the early 21st century, and these devices could potentially shorten children’s attentions spans.
Thus, what might seem like inattention to some parents and teachers could simply reflect exposure to too
much technology.
• ADHD diagnostic criteria have changed over time.
Autism Spectrum Disorder
A seminal paper published in 1943 by psychiatrist Leo Kanner described an unusual neurodevelopmental
condition he observed in a group of children. He called this condition early infantile autism, and it was
characterized mainly by an inability to form close emotional ties with others, speech and language
abnormalities, repetitive behaviors, and an intolerance of minor changes in the environment and in normal
routines (Bregman, 2005). What the DSM-5 refers to as autism spectrum disorder today, is a direct extension
of Kanner’s work.
Autism spectrum disorder is probably the most misunderstood of the neurodevelopmental disorders. Children
with this disorder show signs of significant disturbances in three main areas: (a) deficits in social interaction,
(b) deficits in communication, and (c) repetitive patterns of behavior or interests. These disturbances appear
early in life and cause serious impairments in functioning (APA, 2013). The child with autism spectrum
disorder might exhibit deficits in social interaction by not initiating conversations with other children or
turning their head away when spoken to. Typically, these children do not make eye contact with others and
seem to prefer playing alone rather than with others. In some cases, it is almost as though these individuals
live in a personal and isolated social world others are simply not privy to or able to penetrate. Communication
deficits can range from a complete lack of speech, to one word responses (e.g., saying “Yes” or “No” when
replying to questions or statements that require additional elaboration), to echoed speech (e.g., parroting what
another person says, either immediately or several hours or even days later), to difficulty maintaining a
conversation because of an inability to reciprocate others’ comments. These deficits can also include problems
in using and understanding nonverbal cues (e.g., facial expressions, gestures, and postures) that facilitate
normal communication.
Repetitive patterns of behavior or interests can be exhibited a number of ways. The child might engage in
stereotyped, repetitive movements (rocking, head-banging, or repeatedly dropping an object and then picking
15.10 • Disorders in Childhood 579
it up), or they might show great distress at small changes in routine or the environment. In some cases, the
person with autism spectrum disorder might show highly restricted and fixated interests that appear to be
abnormal in their intensity. For instance, the person might learn and memorize every detail about something
even though doing so serves no apparent purpose. Importantly, autism spectrum disorder is not the same
thing as intellectual disability, although these two conditions are often comorbid. The DSM-5 specifies that the
symptoms of autism spectrum disorder are not caused or explained by intellectual disability.
Life Problems From Autism Spectrum Disorder
Autism spectrum disorder is referred to in everyday language as autism; in fact, the disorder was termed
“autistic disorder” in earlier editions of the DSM, and its diagnostic criteria were much narrower than those of
autism spectrum disorder. The qualifier “spectrum” in autism spectrum disorder is used to indicate that
individuals with the disorder can show a range, or spectrum, of symptoms that vary in their magnitude and
severity: some severe, others less severe. The previous edition of the DSM included a diagnosis of Asperger’s
disorder, generally recognized as a less severe form of autistic disorder; individuals diagnosed with Asperger’s
disorder were described as having average or high intelligence and a strong vocabulary, but exhibiting
impairments in social interaction and social communication, such as talking only about their special interests
(Wing, Gould, & Gillberg, 2011). However, because research has failed to demonstrate that Asperger’s disorder
differs qualitatively from autistic disorder, the DSM-5 does not include it, which is prompting concerns among
some parents that their children may no longer be eligible for special services (“Asperger’s Syndrome
Dropped,” 2012). Some individuals with autism spectrum disorder, particularly those with better language and
intellectual skills, can live and work independently as adults. However, most do not because the symptoms
remain sufficient to cause serious impairment in many realms of life (APA, 2013).

Current estimates from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s Autism and Developmental Disabilities
Monitoring Network indicate that 1 in 59 children in the United States has autism spectrum disorder; the
disorder is 4 times more common among boys (1 in 38) than in girls (1 in 152) (Baio et al, 2018). Rates of
autistic spectrum disorder have increased dramatically since the 1980s. For example, California saw an
increase of 273% in reported cases from 1987 through 1998 (Byrd, 2002); between 2000 and 2008, the rate of
autism diagnoses in the United States increased 78% (CDC, 2012). Although it is difficult to interpret this
increase, it is possible that the rise in prevalence is the result of the broadening of the diagnosis, increased
efforts to identify cases in the community, and greater awareness and acceptance of the diagnosis. In addition,
mental health professionals are now more knowledgeable about autism spectrum disorder and are better
equipped to make the diagnosis, even in subtle cases (Novella, 2008).
Causes of Autism Spectrum Disorder
The exact causes of autism spectrum disorder remain unknown despite massive research efforts over the last
two decades (Meek, Lemery-Chalfant, Jahromi, & Valiente, 2013). Autism appears to be strongly influenced by
genetics, as identical twins show concordance rates of 60%–90%, whereas concordance rates for fraternal
twins and siblings are 5%–10% (Autism Genome Project Consortium, 2007). Many different genes and gene
mutations have been implicated in autism (Meek et al., 2013). Among the genes involved are those important
in the formation of synaptic circuits that facilitate communication between different areas of the brain
(Gauthier et al., 2011). A number of environmental factors are also thought to be associated with increased
risk for autism spectrum disorder, at least in part, because they contribute to new mutations. These factors
include exposure to pollutants, such as plant emissions and mercury, urban versus rural residence, and
vitamin D deficiency (Kinney, Barch, Chayka, Napoleon, & Munir, 2009).

Child Vaccinations and Autism Spectrum Disorder
In the late 1990s, a prestigious medical journal published an article purportedly showing that autism is
triggered by the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine. These findings were very controversial and drew
a great deal of attention, sparking an international forum on whether children should be vaccinated. In a
shocking turn of events, some years later the article was retracted by the journal that had published it after
evidence of fraud and unethical practices on the part of the lead researcher. Despite the retraction, the
reporting in popular media led to concerns about a possible link between vaccines and autism persisting. A
recent survey of parents, for example, found that roughly a third of respondents expressed such a concern
(Kennedy, LaVail, Nowak, Basket, & Landry, 2011); and perhaps fearing that their children would develop
autism, more than 10% of parents of young children refuse or delay vaccinations (Dempsey et al., 2011). Some
parents of children with autism mounted a campaign against scientists who refuted the vaccine-autism link.
Even politicians and several well-known celebrities weighed in; for example, actress Jenny McCarthy (who
believed that a vaccination caused her son’s autism) co-authored a book on the matter. However, there is no
scientific evidence that a link exists between autism and vaccinations (Hughes, 2007). Indeed, a recent study
compared the vaccination histories of 256 children with autism spectrum disorder with that of 752 control
children across three time periods during their first two years of life (birth to 3 months, birth to 7 months, and
birth to 2 years) (DeStefano, Price, & Weintraub, 2013). At the time of the study, the children were between 6
and 13 years old, and their prior vaccination records were obtained. Because vaccines contain immunogens
(substances that fight infections), the investigators examined medical records to see how many immunogens
children received to determine if those children who received more immunogens were at greater risk for
developing autism spectrum disorder. The results of this study, a portion of which are shown in Figure 15.19,
clearly demonstrate that the quantity of immunogens from vaccines received during the first two years of life
were not at all related to the development of autism spectrum disorder. There is not a relationship between
vaccinations and autism spectrum disorders.
FIGURE 15.19 In terms of their exposure to immunogens in vaccines, overall, there is not a significant difference
between children with autism spectrum disorder and their age-matched controls without the disorder (DeStefano et
al., 2013).
Why does concern over vaccines and autism spectrum disorder persist? Since the proliferation of the Internet
in the 1990s, parents have been constantly bombarded with online information that can become magnified
and take on a life of its own. The enormous volume of electronic information pertaining to autism spectrum
15.10 • Disorders in Childhood 581
disorder, combined with how difficult it can be to grasp complex scientific concepts, can make separating good
research from bad challenging (Downs, 2008). Notably, the study that fueled the controversy reported that 8
out of 12 children—according to their parents—developed symptoms consistent with autism spectrum
disorder shortly after receiving a vaccination. To conclude that vaccines cause autism spectrum disorder on
this basis, as many did, is clearly incorrect for a number of reasons, not the least of which is because
correlation does not imply causation, as you’ve learned.
Additionally, as was the case with diet and ADHD in the 1970s, the notion that autism spectrum disorder is
caused by vaccinations is appealing to some because it provides a simple explanation for this condition. Like
all disorders, however, there are no simple explanations for autism spectrum disorder. Although the research
discussed above has shed some light on its causes, science is still a long way from complete understanding of
the disorder.
15.11 Personality Disorders
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the nature of personality disorders and how they differ from other disorders
• List and distinguish between the three clusters of personality disorders
• Identify the basic features of borderline personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder, and the factors
that are important in the etiology of both
The term personality refers loosely to one’s stable, consistent, and distinctive way of thinking about, feeling,
acting, and relating to the world. People with personality disorders exhibit a personality style that differs
markedly from the expectations of their culture, is pervasive and inflexible, begins in adolescence or early
adulthood, and causes distress or impairment (APA, 2013). Generally, individuals with these disorders exhibit
enduring personality styles that are extremely troubling and often create problems for them and those with
whom they come into contact. Their maladaptive personality styles frequently bring them into conflict with
others, disrupt their ability to develop and maintain social relationships, and prevent them from
accomplishing realistic life goals.
The DSM-5 recognizes 10 personality disorders, organized into 3 different clusters. Cluster A disorders include
paranoid personality disorder, schizoid personality disorder, and schizotypal personality disorder. People with
these disorders display a personality style that is odd or eccentric. Cluster B disorders include antisocial
personality disorder, histrionic personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder, and borderline
personality disorder. People with these disorders usually are impulsive, overly dramatic, highly emotional, and
erratic. Cluster C disorders include avoidant personality disorder, dependent personality disorder, and
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (which is not the same thing as obsessive-compulsive disorder).
People with these disorders often appear to be nervous and fearful. Table 15.2 provides a description of each
of the DSM-5 personality disorders:

Context: cultural expectations, and a person who reports such inner experiences is readily labeled as psychologically disordered. In other cultures, visions that, for example, pertain to future events may be regarded as normal experiences that are positively valued (Bourguignon, 1970). Finally, it is important to recognize that cultural norms change over time: what might be considered typical in a society at one time may no longer be viewed this way later, similar to how fashion trends from one era may elicit quizzical looks decades later—imagine how a headband, legwarmers, and the big hair of the 1980s would go over on your campus today. The Myth of Mental Illness In the 1950s and 1960s, the concept of mental illness was widely criticized. One of the major criticisms focused on the notion that mental illness was a “myth that justifies psychiatric intervention in socially disapproved behavior” (Wakefield, 1992). Thomas Szasz (1960), a noted psychiatrist, was perhaps the biggest proponent of this view. Szasz argued that the notion of mental illness was invented by society (and the mental health establishment) to stigmatize and subjugate people whose behavior violates accepted social and legal norms. Indeed, Szasz suggested that what appear to be symptoms of mental illness are more appropriately characterized as “problems in living” (Szasz, 1960). In his 1961 book, The Myth of Mental Illness: Foundations of a Theory of Personal Conduct, Szasz expressed his disdain for the concept of mental illness and for the field of psychiatry in general (Oliver, 2006). The basis for Szasz’s attack was his contention that detectable abnormalities in bodily structures and functions (e.g., infections and organ damage or dysfunction) represent the defining features of genuine illness or disease, and because symptoms of purported mental illness are not accompanied by such detectable abnormalities, so-called psychological disorders are not disorders at all. Szasz (1961/2010) proclaimed that “disease or illness can only be defined by the presence of disease or abnormality, not by its absence” and that there is no such thing as a “normal” or “healthy” state of mind (p. 3). He went on to argue that psychiatrists and other medical professionals should abandon their efforts to diagnose and treat mental illnesses and instead focus on the improvement of people’s physical health and well-being. Szasz’s views were not shared by most of his contemporaries, however. For instance, in an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine (N Engl J Med), in which he argued against the use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in the treatment of depression, he was met with strong opposition from many of those who believed that ECT was an effective treatment for depression. The article, entitled “Psychiatry and Ectoplasmic Treatment of Depression,” was written by a psychiatrist who was not a member of either the American Psychiatric Association (APA) or the National Association of Social Workers (NASW), and it was rejected by APA and NASW for being “incompatible with the APA’s ethical standards and professional code of conduct” and “contrary to the principles of professional conduct and ethics” of both of these professional organizations (Szasz, et al., n.d.). In addition to rejecting the article in its entirety, many other articles and books were written in response to his views, such as the book The Psychopathology of Everyday Life, which was published by the University of California Press and was heavily criticized for its anti-psychiatrist stance and its emphasis on everyday life rather than on psychiatric diagnosis and treatment (Cohen & Cohen, n. d.). The book was later reprinted by Oxford University Press (OUP) and became a best-seller, selling more than 5 million copies worldwide. It has also been translated into several other languages, including French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Arabic, Hebrew, Swahili, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, Hindi, Kannada, Punjabi, Malayalam, Thai, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Cambodian, Burmese, Lao, Mongolian, Uighur, Kazakh, Tajik, Kyrgyz, Uzbek, Georgian, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Tatar, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Armenian, Bulgarian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish,","{""sections"": [""Psychological Disorders"", ""Psychological Disorders/Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders""], ""pages"": [""592"", ""554"", ""557""]}"

How Valid Are the SAT and ACT?
Standardized tests like the SAT and ACT are supposed to measure an individual’s aptitude for a college
education, but how reliable and valid are such tests? Research conducted by the College Board suggests that
scores on the SAT have high predictive validity for first-year college students’ GPA (Kobrin, Patterson, Shaw,
Mattern, & Barbuti, 2008). In this context, predictive validity refers to the test’s ability to effectively predict the
GPA of college freshmen. Given that many institutions of higher education require the SAT or ACT for admission,
this high degree of predictive validity might be comforting.
However, the emphasis placed on SAT or ACT scores in college admissions is changing based on a number of
factors. For one, some researchers assert that these tests are biased, and students from historically marginalized
populations are at a disadvantage that unfairly reduces the likelihood of being admitted into a college (Santelices
& Wilson, 2010). Additionally, some research has suggested that the predictive validity of these tests is grossly
exaggerated in how well they are able to predict the GPA of first-year college students. In fact, it has been
suggested that the SAT’s predictive validity may be overestimated by as much as 150% (Rothstein, 2004). Many
institutions of higher education are beginning to consider de-emphasizing the significance of SAT scores in
making admission decisions (Rimer, 2008).
Recent examples of high profile cheating scandals both domestically and abroad have only increased the scrutiny
being placed on these types of tests, and as of March 2019, more than 1000 institutions of higher education have
either relaxed or eliminated the requirements for SAT or ACT testing for admissions (Strauss, 2019, March 19).
2.4 Ethics
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Discuss how research involving human subjects is regulated
• Summarize the processes of informed consent and debriefing
• Explain how research involving animal subjects is regulated
Today, scientists agree that good research is ethical in nature and is guided by a basic respect for human
dignity and safety. However, as you will read in the feature box, this has not always been the case. Modern
researchers must demonstrate that the research they perform is ethically sound. This section presents how
ethical considerations affect the design and implementation of research conducted today.
Research Involving Human Participants
Any experiment involving the participation of human subjects is governed by extensive, strict guidelines
designed to ensure that the experiment does not result in harm. Any research institution that receives federal
support for research involving human participants must have access to an institutional review board (IRB).
The IRB is a committee of individuals often made up of members of the institution’s administration, scientists,
and community members (Figure 2.20). The purpose of the IRB is to review proposals for research that
involves human participants. The IRB reviews these proposals with the principles mentioned above in mind,
and generally, approval from the IRB is required in order for the experiment to proceed.
EVERYDAY CONNECTION
2.4 • Ethics 59
FIGURE 2.20 An institution’s IRB meets regularly to review experimental proposals that involve human
participants. (credit: International Hydropower Association/Flickr)
An institution’s IRB requires several components in any experiment it approves. For one, each participant
must sign an informed consent form before they can participate in the experiment. An informed consent form
provides a written description of what participants can expect during the experiment, including potential risks
and implications of the research. It also lets participants know that their involvement is completely voluntary
and can be discontinued without penalty at any time. Furthermore, the informed consent guarantees that any
data collected in the experiment will remain completely confidential. In cases where research participants are
under the age of 18, the parents or legal guardians are required to sign the informed consent form.
LINK T O LEARNING
View this example of a consent form (http://openstax.org/l/consentform) to learn more.
While the informed consent form should be as honest as possible in describing exactly what participants will
be doing, sometimes deception is necessary to prevent participants’ knowledge of the exact research question
from affecting the results of the study. Deception involves purposely misleading experiment participants in
order to maintain the integrity of the experiment, but not to the point where the deception could be considered
harmful. For example, if we are interested in how our opinion of someone is affected by their attire, we might
use deception in describing the experiment to prevent that knowledge from affecting participants’ responses.
In cases where deception is involved, participants must receive a full debriefing upon conclusion of the
study—complete, honest information about the purpose of the experiment, how the data collected will be used,
the reasons why deception was necessary, and information about how to obtain additional information about
the study.
Ethics and the Tuskegee Syphilis Study
Unfortunately, the ethical guidelines that exist for research today were not always applied in the past. In 1932,
rural, Black men from Tuskegee, Alabama, were recruited to participate in an experiment conducted by the U.S.
Public Health Service, with the aim of studying syphilis in Black men (Figure 2.21). In exchange for free medical
care, meals, and burial insurance, 600 men agreed to participate in the study. A little more than half of the men
tested positive for syphilis, and they served as the experimental group (given that the researchers could not
randomly assign participants to groups, this represents a quasi-experiment). The remaining syphilis-free
DIG DEEPER

individuals served as the control group. However, those individuals that tested positive for syphilis were never
informed that they had the disease.
While there was no treatment for syphilis when the study began, by 1947 penicillin was recognized as an
effective treatment for the disease. Despite this, no penicillin was administered to the participants in this study,
and the participants were not allowed to seek treatment at any other facilities if they continued in the study. Over
the course of 40 years, many of the participants unknowingly spread syphilis to their wives (and subsequently
their children born from their wives) and eventually died because they never received treatment for the disease.
This study was discontinued in 1972 when the experiment was discovered by the national press (Tuskegee
University, n.d.). The resulting outrage over the experiment led directly to the National Research Act of 1974 and
the strict ethical guidelines for research on humans described in this chapter. Why is this study unethical? How
were the men who participated and their families harmed as a function of this research?

Research Involving Animal Subjects
Many psychologists conduct research involving animal subjects. Often, these researchers use rodents (Figure
2.22) or birds as the subjects of their experiments—the APA estimates that 90% of all animal research in
psychology uses these species (American Psychological Association, n.d.). Because many basic processes in
animals are sufficiently similar to those in humans, these animals are acceptable substitutes for research that
would be considered unethical in human participants.
FIGURE 2.22 Rats, like the one shown here, often serve as the subjects of animal research.
This does not mean that animal researchers are immune to ethical concerns. Indeed, the humane and ethical
2.4 • Ethics 61
treatment of animal research subjects is a critical aspect of this type of research. Researchers must design
their experiments to minimize any pain or distress experienced by animals serving as research subjects.
Whereas IRBs review research proposals that involve human participants, animal experimental proposals are
reviewed by an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). An IACUC consists of institutional
administrators, scientists, veterinarians, and community members. This committee is charged with ensuring
that all experimental proposals require the humane treatment of animal research subjects. It also conducts
semi-annual inspections of all animal facilities to ensure that the research protocols are being followed. No
animal research project can proceed without the committee’s approval.

Critical Thinking Questions
25. In this section, there was a discussion about researchers arriving at different conclusions about the use of
technology in certain student populations, with one study determining that a smartphone app for surgery
students seemed effective, but another study finding negative impacts on sleep, communication, and time
management resulting from the use of technology by undergraduates. How might an educational leader
best work through these discrepancies?
26. The scientific method is often described as self-correcting and cyclical. Briefly describe your
understanding of the scientific method with regard to these concepts.
27. In this section, conjoined twins, Krista and Tatiana, were described as being potential participants in a
case study. In what other circumstances would you think that this particular research approach would be
especially helpful and why?
28. Presumably, reality television programs aim to provide a realistic portrayal of the behavior displayed by
the characters featured in such programs. This section pointed out why this is not really the case. What
changes could be made in the way that these programs are produced that would result in more honest
portrayals of realistic behavior?
29. Which of the research methods discussed in this section would be best suited to study the impact of diet
and exercise on the prevalence of a disease such as diabetes? Why?
30. Aside from biomedical research, what other areas of research could greatly benefit by both longitudinal
and archival research?
31. Earlier in this section, we read about research suggesting that there is a correlation between eating cereal
and weight. Cereal companies that present this information in their advertisements could lead someone
to believe that eating more cereal causes healthy weight. Why would they make such a claim and what
arguments could you make to counter this cause-and-effect claim?
32. Recently a study was published in the journal, Nutrition and Cancer, which established a negative
correlation between coffee consumption and breast cancer. Specifically, it was found that women
consuming more than 5 cups of coffee a day were less likely to develop breast cancer than women who
never consumed coffee (Lowcock, Cotterchio, Anderson, Boucher, & El-Sohemy, 2013). Imagine you see a
newspaper story about this research that says, “Coffee Protects Against Cancer.” Why is this headline
misleading and why would a more accurate headline draw less interest?
33. Sometimes, true random sampling can be very difficult to obtain. Many researchers make use of
convenience samples as an alternative. For example, one popular convenience sample would involve
students enrolled in Introduction to Psychology courses. What are the implications of using this sampling
technique?
34. Peer review is an important part of publishing research findings in many scientific disciplines. This
process is normally conducted anonymously; in other words, the author of the article being reviewed does
not know who is reviewing the article, and the reviewers are unaware of the author’s identity. Why would
this be an important part of this process?
2 • Critical Thinking Questions 69
35. Some argue that animal research is inherently flawed in terms of being ethical because unlike human
participants, animals do not consent to be involved in research. Do you agree with this perspective? Given
that animals do not consent to be involved in research projects, what sorts of extra precautions should be
taken to ensure that they receive the most humane treatment possible?
36. At the end of the last section, you were asked to design a basic experiment to answer some question of
interest. What ethical considerations should be made with the study you proposed to ensure that your
experiment would conform to the scientific community’s expectations of ethical research?
Personal Application Questions
37. Healthcare professionals cite an enormous number of health problems related to obesity, and many
people have an understandable desire to attain a healthy weight. There are many diet programs, services,
and products on the market to aid those who wish to lose weight. If a close friend was considering
purchasing or participating in one of these products, programs, or services, how would you make sure
your friend was fully aware of the potential consequences of this decision? What sort of information would
you want to review before making such an investment or lifestyle change yourself?
38. A friend of yours is working part-time in a local pet store. Your friend has become increasingly interested
in how dogs normally communicate and interact with each other, and is thinking of visiting a local
veterinary clinic to see how dogs interact in the waiting room. After reading this section, do you think this
is the best way to better understand such interactions? Do you have any suggestions that might result in
more valid data?
39. As a college student, you are no doubt concerned about the grades that you earn while completing your
coursework. If you wanted to know how overall GPA is related to success in life after college, how would
you choose to approach this question and what kind of resources would you need to conduct this
research?
40. We all have a tendency to make illusory correlations from time to time. Try to think of an illusory
correlation that is held by you, a family member, or a close friend. How do you think this illusory
correlation came about and what can be done in the future to combat them?
41. Are there any questions about human or animal behavior that you would really like to answer? Generate a
hypothesis and briefly describe how you would conduct an experiment to answer your question.
42. Take a few minutes to think about all of the advancements that our society has achieved as a function of
research involving animal subjects. How have you, a friend, or a family member benefited directly from
this kind of research?

3.1 Human Genetics

3.3 Parts of the Nervous System
3.4 The Brain and Spinal Cord
3.5 The Endocrine System
Have you ever taken a device apart to find out how it works? Many of us have done so,
whether to attempt a repair or simply to satisfy our curiosity. A device’s internal workings are often distinct
from its user interface on the outside. For example, we don’t think about microchips and circuits when we turn
up the volume on a mobile phone; instead, we think about getting the volume just right. Similarly, the inner
workings of the human body are often distinct from the external expression of those workings. It is the job of
psychologists to find the connection between these—for example, to figure out how the firings of millions of
neurons become a thought.
This chapter strives to explain the biological mechanisms that underlie behavior. These physiological and
anatomical foundations are the basis for many areas of psychology. In this chapter, you will learn how genetics
influence both physiological and psychological traits. You will become familiar with the structure and function
of the nervous system. And, finally, you will learn how the nervous system interacts with the endocrine system.
3Biopsychology
3.1 Human Genetics
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Explain the basic principles of the theory of evolution by natural selection
• Describe the differences between genotype and phenotype
• Discuss how gene-environment interactions are critical for expression of physical and psychological
characteristics
Psychological researchers study genetics in order to better understand the biological factors that contribute to
certain behaviors. While all humans share certain biological mechanisms, we are each unique. And while our
bodies have many of the same parts—brains and hormones and cells with genetic codes—these are expressed
in a wide variety of behaviors, thoughts, and reactions.
Why do two people infected by the same disease have different outcomes: one surviving and one succumbing
to the ailment? How are genetic diseases passed through family lines? Are there genetic components to
psychological disorders, such as depression or schizophrenia? To what extent might there be a psychological
basis to health conditions such as childhood obesity?
To explore these questions, let’s start by focusing on a specific genetic disorder, sickle cell anemia, and how it
might manifest in two affected sisters. Sickle-cell anemia is a genetic condition in which red blood cells, which
are normally round, take on a crescent-like shape (Figure 3.2). The changed shape of these cells affects how
they function: sickle-shaped cells can clog blood vessels and block blood flow, leading to high fever, severe
pain, swelling, and tissue damage.
FIGURE 3.2 Normal blood cells travel freely through the blood vessels, while sickle-shaped cells form blockages
preventing blood flow.
Many people with sickle-cell anemia—and the particular genetic mutation that causes it—die at an early age.
While the notion of “survival of the fittest” may suggest that people with this disorder have a low survival rate
and therefore the disorder will become less common, this is not the case. Despite the negative evolutionary
effects associated with this genetic mutation, the sickle-cell gene remains relatively common among people of
African descent. Why is this? The explanation is illustrated with the following scenario.
Imagine two young women—Luwi and Sena—sisters in rural Zambia, Africa. Luwi carries the gene for sickle-
cell anemia; Sena does not carry the gene. Sickle-cell carriers have one copy of the sickle-cell gene but do not
have full-blown sickle-cell anemia. They experience symptoms only if they are severely dehydrated or are
deprived of oxygen (as in mountain climbing). Carriers are thought to be immune from malaria (an often
deadly disease that is widespread in tropical climates) because changes in their blood chemistry and immune
functioning prevent the malaria parasite from having its effects (Gong, Parikh, Rosenthal, & Greenhouse,
2013). However, full-blown sickle-cell anemia, with two copies of the sickle-cell gene, does not provide
immunity to malaria.

33,"The Skinner box is a chamber that isolates the subject from the external environment and has a behavior
indicator such as a lever or a button. When the animal pushes the button or lever, the box is able to deliver a
positive reinforcement of the behavior (such as food) or a punishment (such as a noise).
Skinner’s focus on positive and negative reinforcement of learned behaviors had a lasting influence in
psychology that has waned somewhat since the growth of research in cognitive psychology. Despite this,
conditioned learning is still used in human behavioral modification (Greengrass, 2004).
Maslow, Rogers, and Humanism
During the early 20th century, American psychology was dominated by behaviorism and psychoanalysis.
However, some psychologists were uncomfortable with what they viewed as limited perspectives being so
influential to the field. They objected to the pessimism and determinism (all actions driven by the
unconscious) of Freud. They also disliked the reductionism, or simplifying nature, of behaviorism.
Behaviorism is also deterministic at its core, because it sees human behavior as entirely determined by a
combination of genetics and environment. Some psychologists began to form their own ideas that emphasized
personal control, intentionality, and a true predisposition for “good” as important for our self-concept and our
behavior. Thus, humanism emerged. Humanism is a perspective within psychology that emphasizes the
potential for good that is innate to all humans. Two of the most well-known proponents of humanistic
psychology are Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers (O’Hara, n.d.).
Abraham Maslow (1908–1970) was an American psychologist who is best known for proposing a hierarchy of
human needs in motivating behavior (Figure 1.7). Although this concept will be discussed in more detail in a
later chapter, a brief overview will be provided here. Maslow asserted that so long as basic needs necessary for
survival were met (e.g., food, water, shelter), higher-level needs (e.g., social needs) would begin to motivate
behavior. According to Maslow, the highest-level needs relate to self-actualization, a process by which we
achieve our full potential. Obviously, the focus on the positive aspects of human nature that are characteristic
of the humanistic perspective is evident (Thorne & Henley, 2005). Humanistic psychologists rejected, on
principle, the research approach based on reductionist experimentation in the tradition of the physical and
biological sciences, because it missed the “whole” human being. Beginning with Maslow and Rogers, there was
an insistence on a humanistic research program. This program has been largely qualitative (not
measurement-based), but there exist a number of quantitative research strains within humanistic psychology,
including research on happiness, self-concept, meditation, and the outcomes of humanistic psychotherapy
(Friedman, 2008).

FIGURE 1.7 Maslow’s hierarchy of needs is shown.
Carl Rogers (1902–1987) was also an American psychologist who, like Maslow, emphasized the potential for
good that exists within all people (Figure 1.8). Rogers used a therapeutic technique known as client-centered
therapy in helping his clients deal with problematic issues that resulted in their seeking psychotherapy. Unlike
a psychoanalytic approach in which the therapist plays an important role in interpreting what conscious
behavior reveals about the unconscious mind, client-centered therapy involves the patient taking a lead role in
the therapy session. Rogers believed that a therapist needed to display three features to maximize the
effectiveness of this particular approach: unconditional positive regard, genuineness, and empathy.
Unconditional positive regard refers to the fact that the therapist accepts their client for who they are, no
matter what they might say. Provided these factors, Rogers believed that people were more than capable of
dealing with and working through their own issues (Thorne & Henley, 2005).
FIGURE 1.8 Carl Rogers, shown in this portrait, developed a client-centered therapy method that has been
influential in clinical settings. (credit: ""Didius""/Wikimedia Commons)
Humanism has been influential to psychology as a whole. Both Maslow and Rogers are well-known names
among students of psychology (you will read more about both later in this text), and their ideas have influenced
many scholars. Furthermore, Rogers’ client-centered approach to therapy is still commonly used in
psychotherapeutic settings today (O’hara, n.d.)

The Cognitive Revolution
Behaviorism’s emphasis on objectivity and focus on external behavior had pulled psychologists’ attention away
from the mind for a prolonged period of time. The early work of the humanistic psychologists redirected
attention to the individual human as a whole, and as a conscious and self-aware being. By the 1950s, new
disciplinary perspectives in linguistics, neuroscience, and computer science were emerging, and these areas
revived interest in the mind as a focus of scientific inquiry. This particular perspective has come to be known
as the cognitive revolution (Miller, 2003). By 1967, Ulric Neisser published the first textbook entitled Cognitive
Psychology, which served as a core text in cognitive psychology courses around the country (Thorne & Henley,
2005).
Although no one person is entirely responsible for starting the cognitive revolution, Noam Chomsky was very
influential in the early days of this movement (Figure 1.9). Chomsky (1928–), an American linguist, was
dissatisfied with the influence that behaviorism had had on psychology. He believed that psychology’s focus on
behavior was short-sighted and that the field had to re-incorporate mental functioning into its purview if it
were to offer any meaningful contributions to understanding behavior (Miller, 2003).
FIGURE 1.9 Noam Chomsky was very influential in beginning the cognitive revolution. In 2010, this mural honoring
him was put up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (credit: Robert Moran)
European psychology had never really been as influenced by behaviorism as had American psychology; and
thus, the cognitive revolution helped reestablish lines of communication between European psychologists and
their American counterparts. Furthermore, psychologists began to cooperate with scientists in other fields,
like anthropology, linguistics, computer science, and neuroscience, among others. This interdisciplinary
approach often was referred to as the cognitive sciences, and the influence and prominence of this particular
perspective resonates in modern-day psychology (Miller, 2003).
Feminist Psychology
The science of psychology has had an impact on human wellbeing, both positive and negative. The dominant
influence of Western, White, and male academics in the early history of psychology meant that psychology
developed with the biases inherent in those individuals, which often had negative consequences for members of
society who were not White or male. Women, members of ethnic minorities in both the United States and other
countries, and individuals with sexual orientations other than straight had difficulties entering the field of
psychology and therefore influencing its development. They also suffered from the attitudes of White male
psychologists who were not immune to the nonscientific attitudes prevalent in the society in which they

developed and worked. Until the 1960s, the science of psychology was largely a “womanless” psychology
(Crawford & Marecek, 1989), meaning that few women were able to practice psychology, so they had little
influence on what was studied. In addition, the experimental subjects of psychology were mostly men, which
resulted from underlying assumptions that gender had no influence on psychology and that women were not of
sufficient interest to study.
An article by Naomi Weisstein, first published in 1968 (Weisstein, 1993), stimulated a feminist revolution in
psychology by presenting a critique of psychology as a science. She also specifically criticized male psychologists
for constructing the psychology of women entirely out of their own cultural biases and without careful
experimental tests to verify any of their characterizations of women. Weisstein used, as examples, statements by
prominent psychologists in the 1960s, such as this quote by Bruno Bettleheim: “We must start with the
realization that, as much as women want to be good scientists or engineers, they want first and foremost to be
womanly companions of men and to be mothers.” Weisstein’s critique formed the foundation for the subsequent
development of a feminist psychology that attempted to be free of the influence of male cultural biases on our
knowledge of the psychology of women.
Crawford & Marecek (1989) identify several feminist approaches to psychology that can be described as feminist
psychology. These include re-evaluating and discovering the contributions of women to the history of psychology,
studying psychological gender differences, and questioning the male bias present across the practice of the
scientific approach to knowledge.
Multicultural And Cross-Cultural Psychology
Culture impacts individuals, groups, and society. An ongoing issue researchers are trying to correct is that
certain populations have been over-studied and the results of these studies have been applied to other
populations. For example, Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan discuss how WEIRD societies have been
overstudied and the results have been wrongly applied to non-WEIRD societies (2010). WEIRD stands for
western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic. Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan found that there are
many differences between people in the WEIRD group and people in less industrialized, less urban, and non-
Western societies. These differences occur in a variety of areas, including perception, cooperation, and moral
reasoning. That is, people vary depending on their culture and environment. Multicultural psychologists
develop theories and conduct research with diverse populations, typically within one country. Cross-cultural
psychologists compare populations across countries, such as participants from the United States compared to
participants from China.
In 1920, Francis Cecil Sumner was the first African American to receive a PhD in psychology in the United
States. Sumner established a psychology degree program at Howard University, leading to the education of a
new generation of African American psychologists (Black, Spence, and Omari, 2004). Much of the work of early
psychologists from diverse backgrounds was dedicated to challenging intelligence testing and promoting
innovative educational methods for children. George I. Sanchez contested such testing with Mexican American
children. As a psychologist of Mexican heritage, he pointed out that the language and cultural barriers in
testing were keeping children from equal opportunities (Guthrie, 1998). By 1940, he was teaching with his
doctoral degree at University of Texas at Austin and challenging segregated educational practices (Romo,
1986).
Two famous African American researchers and psychologists are Mamie Phipps Clark and her husband,
Kenneth Clark. They are best known for their studies conducted on African American children and doll
preference, research that was instrumental in the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court desegregation
case. The Clarks applied their research to social services and opened the first child guidance center in Harlem
(American Psychological Association, 2019).

The American Psychological Association has several ethnically based organizations for professional
psychologists that facilitate interactions among members. Since psychologists belonging to specific ethnic
groups or cultures have the most interest in studying the psychology of their communities, these organizations
provide an opportunity for the growth of research on the interplay between culture and psychology.
WOMEN IN PSYCHOLOGY
Although rarely given credit, women have been contributing to psychology since its inception as a field of
study. In 1894, Margaret Floy Washburn was the first woman awarded the doctoral degree in psychology. She
wrote The Animal Mind: A Textbook of Comparative Psychology, and it was the standard in the field for over 20
years. In the mid 1890s, Mary Whiton Calkins completed all requirements toward the PhD in psychology, but
Harvard University refused to award her that degree because she was a woman. She had been taught and
mentored by William James, who tried and failed to convince Harvard to award her the doctoral degree. Her
memory research studied primacy and recency (Madigan & O’Hara, 1992), and she also wrote about how
structuralism and functionalism both explained self-psychology (Calkins, 1906).
Another influential woman, Mary Cover Jones, conducted a study she considered to be a sequel to John B.
Watson’s study of Little Albert (you’ll learn about this study in the chapter on Learning). Jones unconditioned
fear in Little Peter, who had been afraid of rabbits (Jones, 1924).
Ethnic minority women contributing to the field of psychology include Martha Bernal and Inez Beverly Prosser;
their studies were related to education. Bernal, the first Latina to earn her doctoral degree in psychology
(1962) conducted much of her research with Mexican American children. Prosser was the first African
American woman awarded the PhD in 1933 at the University of Cincinnati (Benjamin, Henry, & McMahon,
2005).
1.3 Contemporary Psychology
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Appreciate the diversity of interests and foci within psychology
• Understand basic interests and applications in each of the described areas of psychology
• Demonstrate familiarity with some of the major concepts or important figures in each of the described areas of
psychology
Contemporary psychology is a diverse field that is influenced by all of the historical perspectives described in
the preceding section. Reflective of the discipline’s diversity is the diversity seen within the American
Psychological Association (APA). The APA is a professional organization representing psychologists in the
United States. The APA is the largest organization of psychologists in the world, and its mission is to advance
and disseminate psychological knowledge for the betterment of people. There are 54 divisions within the APA,
representing a wide variety of specialties that range from Societies for the Psychology of Religion and
Spirituality to Exercise and Sport Psychology to Behavioral Neuroscience and Comparative Psychology.
Reflecting the diversity of the field of psychology itself, members, affiliate members, and associate members
span the spectrum from students to doctoral-level psychologists, and come from a variety of places including
educational settings, criminal justice, hospitals, the armed forces, and industry (American Psychological
Association, 2014). G. Stanley Hall was the first president of the APA. Before he earned his doctoral degree, he
was an adjunct instructor at Wilberforce University, a historically Black college/university (HBCU), while
serving as faculty at Antioch College. Hall went on to work under William James, earning his PhD. Eventually,

he became the first president of Clark University in Massachusetts when it was founded (Pickren & Rutherford,
2010).
The Association for Psychological Science (APS) was founded in 1988 and seeks to advance the scientific
orientation of psychology. Its founding resulted from disagreements between members of the scientific and
clinical branches of psychology within the APA. The APS publishes five research journals and engages in
education and advocacy with funding agencies. A significant proportion of its members are international,
although the majority is located in the United States. Other organizations provide networking and
collaboration opportunities for professionals of several ethnic or racial groups working in psychology, such as
the National Latina/o Psychological Association (NLPA), the Asian American Psychological Association (AAPA),
the Association of Black Psychologists (ABPsi), and the Society of Indian Psychologists (SIP). Most of these
groups are also dedicated to studying psychological and social issues within their specific communities.
This section will provide an overview of the major subdivisions within psychology today in the order in which
they are introduced throughout the remainder of this textbook. This is not meant to be an exhaustive listing,
but it will provide insight into the major areas of research and practice of modern-day psychologists.

Biopsychology and Evolutionary Psychology
As the name suggests, biopsychology explores how our biology influences our behavior. While biological
psychology is a broad field, many biological psychologists want to understand how the structure and function
of the nervous system is related to behavior (Figure 1.10). As such, they often combine the research strategies
of both psychologists and physiologists to accomplish this goal (as discussed in Carlson, 2013).
FIGURE 1.10 Biological psychologists study how the structure and function of the nervous system generate
behavior.
The research interests of biological psychologists span a number of domains, including but not limited to,
1.3 • Contemporary Psychology 19
sensory and motor systems, sleep, drug use and abuse, ingestive behavior, reproductive behavior,
neurodevelopment, plasticity of the nervous system, and biological correlates of psychological disorders.
Given the broad areas of interest falling under the purview of biological psychology, it will probably come as no
surprise that individuals from all sorts of backgrounds are involved in this research, including biologists,
medical professionals, physiologists, and chemists. This interdisciplinary approach is often referred to as
neuroscience, of which biological psychology is a component (Carlson, 2013).
While biopsychology typically focuses on the immediate causes of behavior based in the physiology of a
human or other animal, evolutionary psychology seeks to study the ultimate biological causes of behavior. To
the extent that a behavior is impacted by genetics, a behavior, like any anatomical characteristic of a human or
animal, will demonstrate adaption to its surroundings. These surroundings include the physical environment
and, since interactions between organisms can be important to survival and reproduction, the social
environment. The study of behavior in the context of evolution has its origins with Charles Darwin, the co-
discoverer of the theory of evolution by natural selection. Darwin was well aware that behaviors should be
adaptive and wrote books titled, The Descent of Man (1871) and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and
Animals (1872), to explore this field.
Evolutionary psychology, and specifically, the evolutionary psychology of humans, has enjoyed a resurgence in
recent decades. To be subject to evolution by natural selection, a behavior must have a significant genetic
cause. In general, we expect all human cultures to express a behavior if it is caused genetically, since the
genetic differences among human groups are small. The approach taken by most evolutionary psychologists is
to predict the outcome of a behavior in a particular situation based on evolutionary theory and then to make
observations, or conduct experiments, to determine whether the results match the theory. It is important to
recognize that these types of studies are not strong evidence that a behavior is adaptive, since they lack
information that the behavior is in some part genetic and not entirely cultural (Endler, 1986). Demonstrating
that a trait, especially in humans, is naturally selected is extraordinarily difficult; perhaps for this reason,
some evolutionary psychologists are content to assume the behaviors they study have genetic determinants
(Confer et al., 2010).
One other drawback of evolutionary psychology is that the traits that we possess now evolved under
environmental and social conditions far back in human history, and we have a poor understanding of what
these conditions were. This makes predictions about what is adaptive for a behavior difficult. Behavioral traits
need not be adaptive under current conditions, only under the conditions of the past when they evolved, about
which we can only hypothesize.
There are many areas of human behavior for which evolution can make predictions. Examples include
memory, mate choice, relationships between kin, friendship and cooperation, parenting, social organization,
and status (Confer et al., 2010).
Evolutionary psychologists have had success in finding experimental correspondence between observations
and expectations. In one example, in a study of mate preference differences between men and women that
spanned 37 cultures, Buss (1989) found that women valued earning potential factors greater than men, and
men valued potential reproductive factors (youth and attractiveness) greater than women in their prospective
mates. In general, the predictions were in line with the predictions of evolution, although there were deviations
in some cultures.
Sensation and Perception
Scientists interested in both physiological aspects of sensory systems as well as in the psychological
experience of sensory information work within the area of sensation and perception (Figure 1.11). As such,
sensation and perception research is also quite interdisciplinary. Imagine walking between buildings as you
move from one class to another. You are inundated with sights, sounds, touch sensations, and smells. You also
experience the temperature of the air around you and maintain your balance as you make your way. These are
20 1 • Introduction to Psychology
Access for free at openstax.org
all factors of interest to someone working in the domain of sensation and perception.
FIGURE 1.11 When you look at this image, you may see a duck or a rabbit. The sensory information remains the
same, but your perception can vary dramatically.
As described in a later chapter that focuses on the results of studies in sensation and perception, our
experience of our world is not as simple as the sum total of all of the sensory information (or sensations)
together. Rather, our experience (or perception) is complex and is influenced by where we focus our attention,
our previous experiences, and even our cultural backgrounds.
Cognitive Psychology
As mentioned in the previous section, the cognitive revolution created an impetus for psychologists to focus
their attention on better understanding the mind and mental processes that underlie behavior. Thus, cognitive
psychology is the area of psychology that focuses on studying cognitions, or thoughts, and their relationship to
our experiences and our actions. Like biological psychology, cognitive psychology is broad in its scope and
often involves collaborations among people from a diverse range of disciplinary backgrounds. This has led
some to coin the term cognitive science to describe the interdisciplinary nature of this area of research (Miller,
2003).
Cognitive psychologists have research interests that span a spectrum of topics, ranging from attention to
problem solving to language to memory. The approaches used in studying these topics are equally diverse.
Given such diversity, cognitive psychology is not captured in one chapter of this text per se; rather, various
concepts related to cognitive psychology will be covered in relevant portions of the chapters in this text on
sensation and perception, thinking and intelligence, memory, lifespan development, social psychology, and
therapy.
Developmental Psychology
Developmental psychology is the scientific study of development across a lifespan. Developmental
psychologists are interested in processes related to physical maturation. However, their focus is not limited to
the physical changes associated with aging, as they also focus on changes in cognitive skills, moral reasoning,
social behavior, and other psychological attributes.
Early developmental psychologists focused primarily on changes that occurred through reaching adulthood,
providing enormous insight into the differences in physical, cognitive, and social capacities that exist between
very young children and adults. For instance, research by Jean Piaget (Figure 1.12) demonstrated that very
young children do not demonstrate object permanence. Object permanence refers to the understanding that
physical things continue to exist, even if they are hidden from us. If you were to show an adult a toy, and then
hide it behind a curtain, the adult knows that the toy still exists. However, very young infants act as if a hidden
object no longer exists. The age at which object permanence is achieved is somewhat controversial (Munakata,
McClelland, Johnson, and Siegler, 1997).
1.3 • Contemporary Psychology 21
FIGURE 1.12 Jean Piaget is famous for his theories regarding changes in cognitive ability that occur as we move
from infancy to adulthood.
While Piaget was focused on cognitive changes during infancy and childhood as we move to adulthood, there is
an increasing interest in extending research into the changes that occur much later in life. This may be
reflective of changing population demographics of developed nations as a whole. As more and more people live
longer lives, the number of people of advanced age will continue to increase. Indeed, it is estimated that there
were just over 40 million people aged 65 or older living in the United States in 2010. However, by 2020, this
number is expected to increase to about 55 million. By the year 2050, it is estimated that nearly 90 million
people in this country will be 65 or older (Department of Health and Human Services, n.d.).
Personality Psychology
Personality psychology focuses on patterns of thoughts and behaviors that make each individual unique.
Several individuals (e.g., Freud and Maslow) that we have already discussed in our historical overview of
psychology, and the American psychologist Gordon Allport, contributed to early theories of personality. These
early theorists attempted to explain how an individual’s personality develops from their given perspective. For
example, Freud proposed that personality arose as conflicts between the conscious and unconscious parts of
the mind were carried out over the lifespan. Specifically, Freud theorized that an individual went through
various psychosexual stages of development. According to Freud, adult personality would result from the
resolution of various conflicts that centered on the migration of erogenous (or sexual pleasure-producing)
zones from the oral (mouth) to the anus to the phallus to the genitals. Like many of Freud’s theories, this
particular idea was controversial and did not lend itself to experimental tests (Person, 1980).
More recently, the study of personality has taken on a more quantitative approach. Rather than explaining how
personality arises, research is focused on identifying personality traits, measuring these traits, and
determining how these traits interact in a particular context to determine how a person will behave in any
given situation. Personality traits are relatively consistent patterns of thought and behavior, and many have
proposed that five trait dimensions are sufficient to capture the variations in personality seen across
individuals. These five dimensions are known as the “Big Five” or the Five Factor model, and include
dimensions of conscientiousness, agreeableness, neuroticism, openness, and extraversion (Figure 1.13). Each
of these traits has been demonstrated to be relatively stable over the lifespan (e.g., Rantanen, Metsäpelto, Feldt,
Pulkinnen, and Kokko, 2007; Soldz & Vaillant, 1999; McCrae & Costa, 2008) and is influenced by genetics (e.g.,
Jang, Livesly, and Vernon, 1996).

FIGURE 1.13 Each of the dimensions of the Five Factor model is shown in this figure. The provided description
would describe someone who scored highly on that given dimension. Someone with a lower score on a given
dimension could be described in opposite terms.
Social Psychology
Social psychology focuses on how we interact with and relate to others. Social psychologists conduct research
on a wide variety of topics that include differences in how we explain our own behavior versus how we explain
the behaviors of others, prejudice, and attraction, and how we resolve interpersonal conflicts. Social
psychologists have also sought to determine how being among other people changes our own behavior and
patterns of thinking.
There are many interesting examples of social psychological research, and you will read about many of these
in a later chapter of this textbook. Until then, you will be introduced to one of the most controversial
psychological studies ever conducted. Stanley Milgram was an American social psychologist who is most
famous for research that he conducted on obedience. After the holocaust, in 1961, a Nazi war criminal, Adolf
Eichmann, who was accused of committing mass atrocities, was put on trial. Many people wondered how
German soldiers were capable of torturing prisoners in concentration camps, and they were unsatisfied with
the excuses given by soldiers that they were simply following orders. At the time, most psychologists agreed
that few people would be willing to inflict such extraordinary pain and suffering, simply because they were
obeying orders. Milgram decided to conduct research to determine whether or not this was true (Figure 1.14).
As you will read later in the text, Milgram found that nearly two-thirds of his participants were willing to
deliver what they believed to be lethal shocks to another person, simply because they were instructed to do so
by an authority figure (in this case, a man dressed in a lab coat). This was in spite of the fact that participants
1.3 • Contemporary Psychology 23
then, that individuals earning bachelor’s degrees in psychology find themselves in a number of different
careers, as shown in Table 1.1. Examples of a few such careers can involve serving as case managers, working
in sales, working in human resource departments, and teaching in high schools. The rapidly growing realm of
healthcare professions is another field in which an education in psychology is helpful and sometimes required.
For example, the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) exam that people must take to be admitted to medical
school now includes a section on the psychological foundations of behavior.

Summary
1.1 What Is Psychology?
Psychology is defined as the scientific study of mind and behavior. Students of psychology develop critical
thinking skills, become familiar with the scientific method, and recognize the complexity of behavior.
1.2 History of Psychology
Before the time of Wundt and James, questions about the mind were considered by philosophers. However,
both Wundt and James helped create psychology as a distinct scientific discipline. Wundt was a structuralist,
which meant he believed that our cognitive experience was best understood by breaking that experience into
its component parts. He thought this was best accomplished by introspection.
30 1 • Key Terms
Access for free at openstax.org
William James was the first American psychologist, and he was a proponent of functionalism. This particular
perspective focused on how mental activities served as adaptive responses to an organism’s environment. Like
Wundt, James also relied on introspection; however, his research approach also incorporated more objective
measures as well.
Sigmund Freud believed that understanding the unconscious mind was absolutely critical to understand
conscious behavior. This was especially true for individuals that he saw who suffered from various hysterias
and neuroses. Freud relied on dream analysis, slips of the tongue, and free association as means to access the
unconscious. Psychoanalytic theory remained a dominant force in clinical psychology for several decades.
Gestalt psychology was very influential in Europe. Gestalt psychology takes a holistic view of an individual and
his experiences. As the Nazis came to power in Germany, Wertheimer, Koffka, and Köhler immigrated to the
United States. Although they left their laboratories and their research behind, they did introduce America to
Gestalt ideas. Some of the principles of Gestalt psychology are still very influential in the study of sensation
and perception.
One of the most influential schools of thought within psychology’s history was behaviorism. Behaviorism
focused on making psychology an objective science by studying overt behavior and deemphasizing the
importance of unobservable mental processes. John Watson is often considered the father of behaviorism, and
B. F. Skinner’s contributions to our understanding of principles of operant conditioning cannot be
underestimated.
As behaviorism and psychoanalytic theory took hold of so many aspects of psychology, some began to become
dissatisfied with psychology’s picture of human nature. Thus, a humanistic movement within psychology
began to take hold. Humanism focuses on the potential of all people for good. Both Maslow and Rogers were
influential in shaping humanistic psychology.
During the 1950s, the landscape of psychology began to change. A science of behavior began to shift back to its
roots of focus on mental processes. The emergence of neuroscience and computer science aided this
transition. Ultimately, the cognitive revolution took hold, and people came to realize that cognition was crucial
to a true appreciation and understanding of behavior.
1.3 Contemporary Psychology
Psychology is a diverse discipline that is made up of several major subdivisions with unique perspectives.
Biological psychology involves the study of the biological bases of behavior. Sensation and perception refer to
the area of psychology that is focused on how information from our sensory modalities is received, and how
this information is transformed into our perceptual experiences of the world around us. Cognitive psychology
is concerned with the relationship that exists between thought and behavior, and developmental psychologists
study the physical and cognitive changes that occur throughout one’s lifespan. Personality psychology focuses
on individuals’ unique patterns of behavior, thought, and emotion. Industrial and organizational psychology,
health psychology, sport and exercise psychology, forensic psychology, and clinical psychology are all
considered applied areas of psychology. Industrial and organizational psychologists apply psychological
concepts to I-O settings. Health psychologists look for ways to help people live healthier lives, and clinical
psychology involves the diagnosis and treatment of psychological disorders and other problematic behavioral
patterns. Sport and exercise psychologists study the interactions between thoughts, emotions, and physical
performance in sports, exercise, and other activities. Forensic psychologists carry out activities related to
psychology in association with the justice system.
1.4 Careers in Psychology
Generally, academic careers in psychology require doctoral degrees. However, there are a number of
nonacademic career options for people who have master’s degrees in psychology. While people with bachelor’s
degrees in psychology have more limited psychology-related career options, the skills acquired as a function of

Context: The Skinner box is a chamber that isolates the subject from the external environment and has a behavior indicator such as a lever or a button. When the animal pushes the button or lever, the box is able to deliver a positive reinforcement of the behavior (such as food) or a punishment (such as a noise). Skinner’s focus on positive and negative reinforcement of learned behaviors had a lasting influence in psychology that has waned somewhat since the growth of research in cognitive psychology. Despite this, conditioned learning is still used in human behavioral modification (Greengrass, 2004). Maslow, Rogers, and Humanism During the early 20th century, American psychology was dominated by behaviorism and psychoanalysis. However, some psychologists were uncomfortable with what they viewed as limited perspectives being so influential to the field. They objected to the pessimism and determinism (all actions driven by the unconscious) of Freud. They also disliked the reductionism, or simplifying nature, of behaviorism. Behaviorism is also deterministic at its core, because it sees human behavior as entirely determined by a combination of genetics and environment. Some psychologists began to form their own ideas that emphasized personal control, intentionality, and a true predisposition for “good” as important for our self-concept and our behavior. Thus, humanism emerged. Humanism is a perspective within psychology that emphasizes the potential for good that is innate to all humans. Two of the most well-known proponents of humanistic psychology are Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers (O’Hara, n.d.). Abraham Maslow (1908–1970) was an American psychologist who is best known for proposing a hierarchy of human needs in motivating behavior (Figure 1.7). Although this concept will be discussed in more detail in a later chapter, a brief overview will be provided here. Maslow asserted that so long as basic needs necessary for survival were met (e.g., food, water, shelter), higher-level needs (e.g., social needs) would begin to motivate behavior. According to Maslow, the highest-level needs relate to self-actualization, a process by which we achieve our full potential as human beings. In other words, we strive to become the best version of ourselves that we are capable of becoming. This process of self-realization is what motivates us to pursue our goals and accomplish our life’s purpose. The higher the level of need that a person is motivated to meet (i.e., the higher the “hierarchy” of needs), the more likely it is that he or she will act on that need. For example, if someone is motivated to fulfill their need for love and belonging, they are likely to seek out a romantic partner. If they are not motivated by this need, then they may not pursue romantic relationships. Similarly, someone motivated by the need to be respected and valued will likely avoid relationships with people who do not meet their needs. However, this does not mean that they will avoid all relationships altogether. Rather, it means that they will only pursue relationships in which they feel valued and respected. The concept of motivation has been a topic of debate among psychologists for many years. There are several theories that have been proposed to explain the relationship between motivation and behavior. One of these theories is known as the dual-process theory, which posits that there are two types of processes involved in motivation: the automatic process and the deliberate process. Automatic processes are those processes that occur without conscious thought or effort, while deliberate processes occur with conscious thought and effort. These processes can be further divided into two categories: goal-directed and task directed processes. Goal-directed processes refer to those processes that are focused on achieving a specific goal or objective, whereas task directed processes involve the pursuit of a task or activity. It is important to note that these categories are not mutually exclusive, as some processes may be a combination of both goal and task-oriented processes. Goal- and Task- Oriented Processes Goal-Oriented Process A goal-oriented process is one that involves an individual’s desire to achieve a particular goal or objective. Examples of goal-orientated processes include: • Pursuing a hobby or interest • Completing a project or task at work or school Task- oriented processes, on the other hand, involve activities or tasks that individuals engage in in order to achieve their goals or objectives. Tasks can range from simple to complex, depending on their nature. Examples of tasks include completing a math problem, solving a puzzle, performing a physical activity, or working on a creative project.

1.4 Careers in Psychology
Clive Wearing is an accomplished musician who lost his ability to form new memories when
he became sick at the age of 46. While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember
what he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is
associated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend’s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John
Nash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would
tell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended
for him. He also began to hear voices and became suspicious of the people around him. Soon thereafter, Nash
was diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a state-run mental institution (O’Connor & Robertson,
1Introduction to Psychology
2002). Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these
experiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain’s internal
processes and people’s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of
psychology has explored these questions.
1.1 What Is Psychology?
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Define psychology
• Understand the merits of an education in psychology
What is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology
explores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists
use the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question
about how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the
phenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or
group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over
time. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes
observations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then
published or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.
Scientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because
it is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We
must ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However,
we can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus,
psychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.
In general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot
arrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the
mind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific
method is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on
observation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or
previous authorities.
It was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this
time, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is,
at its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological
organism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore,
psychology is also a social science.
WHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?
Often, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to
learn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course
because it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as
nursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare
psychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses
across the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology
majors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook’s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality
and political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About
6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S.
Department of Education, 2016).

An education in psychology is valuable for a number of reasons. Psychology students hone critical thinking
skills and are trained in the use of the scientific method. Critical thinking is the active application of a set of
skills to information for the understanding and evaluation of that information. The evaluation of
information—assessing its reliability and usefulness— is an important skill in a world full of competing “facts,”
many of which are designed to be misleading. For example, critical thinking involves maintaining an attitude
of skepticism, recognizing internal biases, making use of logical thinking, asking appropriate questions, and
making observations. Psychology students also can develop better communication skills during the course of
their undergraduate coursework (American Psychological Association, 2011). Together, these factors increase
students’ scientific literacy and prepare students to critically evaluate the various sources of information they
encounter.
In addition to these broad-based skills, psychology students come to understand the complex factors that
shape one’s behavior. They appreciate the interaction of our biology, our environment, and our experiences in
determining who we are and how we will behave. They learn about basic principles that guide how we think
and behave, and they come to recognize the tremendous diversity that exists across individuals and across
cultural boundaries (American Psychological Association, 2011).

1.2 History of Psychology
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Understand the importance of Wundt and James in the development of psychology
• Appreciate Freud’s influence on psychology
• Understand the basic tenets of Gestalt psychology
• Appreciate the important role that behaviorism played in psychology’s history
• Understand basic tenets of humanism
• Understand how the cognitive revolution shifted psychology’s focus back to the mind
Psychology is a relatively young science with its experimental roots in the 19th century, compared, for
example, to human physiology, which dates much earlier. As mentioned, anyone interested in exploring issues
related to the mind generally did so in a philosophical context prior to the 19th century. Two 19th century
scholars, Wilhelm Wundt and William James, are generally credited as being the founders of psychology as a
science and academic discipline that was distinct from philosophy. This section will provide an overview of the
shifts in paradigms that have influenced psychology from Wundt and James through today.
Wundt and Structuralism
Wilhelm Wundt (1832–1920) was a German scientist who was the first person to be referred to as a
psychologist. His famous book entitled Principles of Physiological Psychology was published in 1873. Wundt
viewed psychology as a scientific study of conscious experience, and he believed that the goal of psychology
was to identify components of consciousness and how those components combined to result in our conscious
experience. Wundt used introspection (he called it “internal perception”), a process by which someone
examines their own conscious experience as objectively as possible, making the human mind like any other
aspect of nature that a scientist observed. He believed in the notion of voluntarism—that people have free will
and should know the intentions of a psychological experiment if they were participating (Danziger, 1980).
Wundt considered his version experimental introspection; he used instruments such as those that measured
reaction time. He also wrote Volkerpsychologie in 1904 in which he suggested that psychology should include
the study of culture, as it involves the study of people. Edward Titchener, one of his students, went on to
1.2 • History of Psychology 9
develop structuralism. Its focus was on the contents of mental processes rather than their function (Pickren &
Rutherford, 2010). Wundt established his psychology laboratory at the University at Leipzig in 1879 (Figure
1.2). In this laboratory, Wundt and his students conducted experiments on, for example, reaction times. A
subject, sometimes in a room isolated from the scientist, would receive a stimulus such as a light, image, or
sound. The subject’s reaction to the stimulus would be to push a button, and an apparatus would record the
time to reaction. Wundt could measure reaction time to one-thousandth of a second (Nicolas & Ferrand, 1999).
FIGURE 1.2 (a) Wilhelm Wundt is credited as one of the founders of psychology. He created the first laboratory for
psychological research. (b) This photo shows him seated and surrounded by fellow researchers and equipment in
his laboratory in Germany.
However, despite his efforts to train individuals in the process of introspection, this process remained highly
subjective, and there was very little agreement between individuals.
Functionalism
William James, John Dewey, and Charles Sanders Peirce helped establish functional psychology (Figure 1.3).
They accepted Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection and viewed this theory as an explanation of an
organism’s characteristics. Key to that theory is the idea that natural selection leads to organisms that are
adapted to their environment, including their behavior. Adaptation means that a trait of an organism has a
function for the survival and reproduction of the individual, because it has been naturally selected. As James
saw it, psychology’s purpose was to study the function of behavior in the world, and as such, his perspective
was known as functionalism. Functionalism focused on how mental activities helped an organism fit into its
environment. Functionalism has a second, more subtle meaning in that functionalists were more interested in
the operation of the whole mind rather than of its individual parts, which were the focus of structuralism. Like
Wundt, James believed that introspection could serve as one means by which someone might study mental
activities, but James also relied on more objective measures, including the use of various recording devices,
and examinations of concrete products of mental activities and of anatomy and physiology (Gordon, 1995).

The Skinner box is a chamber that isolates the subject from the external environment and has a behavior
indicator such as a lever or a button. When the animal pushes the button or lever, the box is able to deliver a
positive reinforcement of the behavior (such as food) or a punishment (such as a noise).
Skinner’s focus on positive and negative reinforcement of learned behaviors had a lasting influence in
psychology that has waned somewhat since the growth of research in cognitive psychology. Despite this,
conditioned learning is still used in human behavioral modification (Greengrass, 2004).
Maslow, Rogers, and Humanism
During the early 20th century, American psychology was dominated by behaviorism and psychoanalysis.
However, some psychologists were uncomfortable with what they viewed as limited perspectives being so
influential to the field. They objected to the pessimism and determinism (all actions driven by the
unconscious) of Freud. They also disliked the reductionism, or simplifying nature, of behaviorism.
Behaviorism is also deterministic at its core, because it sees human behavior as entirely determined by a
combination of genetics and environment. Some psychologists began to form their own ideas that emphasized
personal control, intentionality, and a true predisposition for “good” as important for our self-concept and our
behavior. Thus, humanism emerged. Humanism is a perspective within psychology that emphasizes the
potential for good that is innate to all humans. Two of the most well-known proponents of humanistic
psychology are Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers (O’Hara, n.d.).
Abraham Maslow (1908–1970) was an American psychologist who is best known for proposing a hierarchy of
human needs in motivating behavior (Figure 1.7). Although this concept will be discussed in more detail in a
later chapter, a brief overview will be provided here. Maslow asserted that so long as basic needs necessary for
survival were met (e.g., food, water, shelter), higher-level needs (e.g., social needs) would begin to motivate
behavior. According to Maslow, the highest-level needs relate to self-actualization, a process by which we
achieve our full potential. Obviously, the focus on the positive aspects of human nature that are characteristic
of the humanistic perspective is evident (Thorne & Henley, 2005). Humanistic psychologists rejected, on
principle, the research approach based on reductionist experimentation in the tradition of the physical and
biological sciences, because it missed the “whole” human being. Beginning with Maslow and Rogers, there was
an insistence on a humanistic research program. This program has been largely qualitative (not
measurement-based), but there exist a number of quantitative research strains within humanistic psychology,
including research on happiness, self-concept, meditation, and the outcomes of humanistic psychotherapy
(Friedman, 2008).

FIGURE 1.7 Maslow’s hierarchy of needs is shown.
Carl Rogers (1902–1987) was also an American psychologist who, like Maslow, emphasized the potential for
good that exists within all people (Figure 1.8). Rogers used a therapeutic technique known as client-centered
therapy in helping his clients deal with problematic issues that resulted in their seeking psychotherapy. Unlike
a psychoanalytic approach in which the therapist plays an important role in interpreting what conscious
behavior reveals about the unconscious mind, client-centered therapy involves the patient taking a lead role in
the therapy session. Rogers believed that a therapist needed to display three features to maximize the
effectiveness of this particular approach: unconditional positive regard, genuineness, and empathy.
Unconditional positive regard refers to the fact that the therapist accepts their client for who they are, no
matter what they might say. Provided these factors, Rogers believed that people were more than capable of
dealing with and working through their own issues (Thorne & Henley, 2005).
FIGURE 1.8 Carl Rogers, shown in this portrait, developed a client-centered therapy method that has been
influential in clinical settings. (credit: ""Didius""/Wikimedia Commons)
Humanism has been influential to psychology as a whole. Both Maslow and Rogers are well-known names
among students of psychology (you will read more about both later in this text), and their ideas have influenced
many scholars. Furthermore, Rogers’ client-centered approach to therapy is still commonly used in
psychotherapeutic settings today (O’hara, n.d.)

The Cognitive Revolution
Behaviorism’s emphasis on objectivity and focus on external behavior had pulled psychologists’ attention away
from the mind for a prolonged period of time. The early work of the humanistic psychologists redirected
attention to the individual human as a whole, and as a conscious and self-aware being. By the 1950s, new
disciplinary perspectives in linguistics, neuroscience, and computer science were emerging, and these areas
revived interest in the mind as a focus of scientific inquiry. This particular perspective has come to be known
as the cognitive revolution (Miller, 2003). By 1967, Ulric Neisser published the first textbook entitled Cognitive
Psychology, which served as a core text in cognitive psychology courses around the country (Thorne & Henley,
2005).
Although no one person is entirely responsible for starting the cognitive revolution, Noam Chomsky was very
influential in the early days of this movement (Figure 1.9). Chomsky (1928–), an American linguist, was
dissatisfied with the influence that behaviorism had had on psychology. He believed that psychology’s focus on
behavior was short-sighted and that the field had to re-incorporate mental functioning into its purview if it
were to offer any meaningful contributions to understanding behavior (Miller, 2003).
FIGURE 1.9 Noam Chomsky was very influential in beginning the cognitive revolution. In 2010, this mural honoring
him was put up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (credit: Robert Moran)
European psychology had never really been as influenced by behaviorism as had American psychology; and
thus, the cognitive revolution helped reestablish lines of communication between European psychologists and
their American counterparts. Furthermore, psychologists began to cooperate with scientists in other fields,
like anthropology, linguistics, computer science, and neuroscience, among others. This interdisciplinary
approach often was referred to as the cognitive sciences, and the influence and prominence of this particular
perspective resonates in modern-day psychology (Miller, 2003).
Feminist Psychology
The science of psychology has had an impact on human wellbeing, both positive and negative. The dominant
influence of Western, White, and male academics in the early history of psychology meant that psychology
developed with the biases inherent in those individuals, which often had negative consequences for members of
society who were not White or male. Women, members of ethnic minorities in both the United States and other
countries, and individuals with sexual orientations other than straight had difficulties entering the field of
psychology and therefore influencing its development. They also suffered from the attitudes of White male
psychologists who were not immune to the nonscientific attitudes prevalent in the society in which they
DIG DEEPER

developed and worked. Until the 1960s, the science of psychology was largely a “womanless” psychology
(Crawford & Marecek, 1989), meaning that few women were able to practice psychology, so they had little
influence on what was studied. In addition, the experimental subjects of psychology were mostly men, which
resulted from underlying assumptions that gender had no influence on psychology and that women were not of
sufficient interest to study.
An article by Naomi Weisstein, first published in 1968 (Weisstein, 1993), stimulated a feminist revolution in
psychology by presenting a critique of psychology as a science. She also specifically criticized male psychologists
for constructing the psychology of women entirely out of their own cultural biases and without careful
experimental tests to verify any of their characterizations of women. Weisstein used, as examples, statements by
prominent psychologists in the 1960s, such as this quote by Bruno Bettleheim: “We must start with the
realization that, as much as women want to be good scientists or engineers, they want first and foremost to be
womanly companions of men and to be mothers.” Weisstein’s critique formed the foundation for the subsequent
development of a feminist psychology that attempted to be free of the influence of male cultural biases on our
knowledge of the psychology of women.
Crawford & Marecek (1989) identify several feminist approaches to psychology that can be described as feminist
psychology. These include re-evaluating and discovering the contributions of women to the history of psychology,
studying psychological gender differences, and questioning the male bias present across the practice of the
scientific approach to knowledge.
Multicultural And Cross-Cultural Psychology
Culture impacts individuals, groups, and society. An ongoing issue researchers are trying to correct is that
certain populations have been over-studied and the results of these studies have been applied to other
populations. For example, Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan discuss how WEIRD societies have been
overstudied and the results have been wrongly applied to non-WEIRD societies (2010). WEIRD stands for
western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic. Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan found that there are
many differences between people in the WEIRD group and people in less industrialized, less urban, and non-
Western societies. These differences occur in a variety of areas, including perception, cooperation, and moral
reasoning. That is, people vary depending on their culture and environment. Multicultural psychologists
develop theories and conduct research with diverse populations, typically within one country. Cross-cultural
psychologists compare populations across countries, such as participants from the United States compared to
participants from China.
In 1920, Francis Cecil Sumner was the first African American to receive a PhD in psychology in the United
States. Sumner established a psychology degree program at Howard University, leading to the education of a
new generation of African American psychologists (Black, Spence, and Omari, 2004). Much of the work of early
psychologists from diverse backgrounds was dedicated to challenging intelligence testing and promoting
innovative educational methods for children. George I. Sanchez contested such testing with Mexican American
children. As a psychologist of Mexican heritage, he pointed out that the language and cultural barriers in
testing were keeping children from equal opportunities (Guthrie, 1998). By 1940, he was teaching with his
doctoral degree at University of Texas at Austin and challenging segregated educational practices (Romo,
1986).
Two famous African American researchers and psychologists are Mamie Phipps Clark and her husband,
Kenneth Clark. They are best known for their studies conducted on African American children and doll
preference, research that was instrumental in the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court desegregation
case. The Clarks applied their research to social services and opened the first child guidance center in Harlem
(American Psychological Association, 2019).

The American Psychological Association has several ethnically based organizations for professional
psychologists that facilitate interactions among members. Since psychologists belonging to specific ethnic
groups or cultures have the most interest in studying the psychology of their communities, these organizations
provide an opportunity for the growth of research on the interplay between culture and psychology.
WOMEN IN PSYCHOLOGY
Although rarely given credit, women have been contributing to psychology since its inception as a field of
study. In 1894, Margaret Floy Washburn was the first woman awarded the doctoral degree in psychology. She
wrote The Animal Mind: A Textbook of Comparative Psychology, and it was the standard in the field for over 20
years. In the mid 1890s, Mary Whiton Calkins completed all requirements toward the PhD in psychology, but
Harvard University refused to award her that degree because she was a woman. She had been taught and
mentored by William James, who tried and failed to convince Harvard to award her the doctoral degree. Her
memory research studied primacy and recency (Madigan & O’Hara, 1992), and she also wrote about how
structuralism and functionalism both explained self-psychology (Calkins, 1906).
Another influential woman, Mary Cover Jones, conducted a study she considered to be a sequel to John B.
Watson’s study of Little Albert (you’ll learn about this study in the chapter on Learning). Jones unconditioned
fear in Little Peter, who had been afraid of rabbits (Jones, 1924).
Ethnic minority women contributing to the field of psychology include Martha Bernal and Inez Beverly Prosser;
their studies were related to education. Bernal, the first Latina to earn her doctoral degree in psychology
(1962) conducted much of her research with Mexican American children. Prosser was the first African
American woman awarded the PhD in 1933 at the University of Cincinnati (Benjamin, Henry, & McMahon,
2005).
1.3 Contemporary Psychology
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Appreciate the diversity of interests and foci within psychology
• Understand basic interests and applications in each of the described areas of psychology
• Demonstrate familiarity with some of the major concepts or important figures in each of the described areas of
psychology
Contemporary psychology is a diverse field that is influenced by all of the historical perspectives described in
the preceding section. Reflective of the discipline’s diversity is the diversity seen within the American
Psychological Association (APA). The APA is a professional organization representing psychologists in the
United States. The APA is the largest organization of psychologists in the world, and its mission is to advance
and disseminate psychological knowledge for the betterment of people. There are 54 divisions within the APA,
representing a wide variety of specialties that range from Societies for the Psychology of Religion and
Spirituality to Exercise and Sport Psychology to Behavioral Neuroscience and Comparative Psychology.
Reflecting the diversity of the field of psychology itself, members, affiliate members, and associate members
span the spectrum from students to doctoral-level psychologists, and come from a variety of places including
educational settings, criminal justice, hospitals, the armed forces, and industry (American Psychological
Association, 2014). G. Stanley Hall was the first president of the APA. Before he earned his doctoral degree, he
was an adjunct instructor at Wilberforce University, a historically Black college/university (HBCU), while
serving as faculty at Antioch College. Hall went on to work under William James, earning his PhD. Eventually,

he became the first president of Clark University in Massachusetts when it was founded (Pickren & Rutherford,
2010).
The Association for Psychological Science (APS) was founded in 1988 and seeks to advance the scientific
orientation of psychology. Its founding resulted from disagreements between members of the scientific and
clinical branches of psychology within the APA. The APS publishes five research journals and engages in
education and advocacy with funding agencies. A significant proportion of its members are international,
although the majority is located in the United States. Other organizations provide networking and
collaboration opportunities for professionals of several ethnic or racial groups working in psychology, such as
the National Latina/o Psychological Association (NLPA), the Asian American Psychological Association (AAPA),
the Association of Black Psychologists (ABPsi), and the Society of Indian Psychologists (SIP). Most of these
groups are also dedicated to studying psychological and social issues within their specific communities.
This section will provide an overview of the major subdivisions within psychology today in the order in which
they are introduced throughout the remainder of this textbook. This is not meant to be an exhaustive listing,
but it will provide insight into the major areas of research and practice of modern-day psychologists.

Biopsychology and Evolutionary Psychology
As the name suggests, biopsychology explores how our biology influences our behavior. While biological
psychology is a broad field, many biological psychologists want to understand how the structure and function
of the nervous system is related to behavior (Figure 1.10). As such, they often combine the research strategies
of both psychologists and physiologists to accomplish this goal (as discussed in Carlson, 2013).

The word “psychology” comes from two Greek words, “psyche” and “logos,” which mean “mind” or “thinking.” Psychologists are interested in how the mind works and how we think and feel. They study the mental processes that occur in the brain, such as perception, attention, memory, thinking, problem solving, emotion, motivation, learning, decision making, self-regulation, personality, social behavior, etc. Psychologists use a variety of methods to study these processes, including observation, experiments, surveys, interviews, questionnaires, brain imaging, neuropsychology, cognitive neuroscience, psychometrics, clinical psychology, developmental psychology, ethnopsychology and social psychology. Psychology has a long and rich history. It has been practiced for thousands of years in many different cultures and societies. For example, in ancient Greece, Plato and Aristotle studied psychology in order to understand the nature of human beings and their relationships with each other and with their environment. In the Middle Ages, Christian theologians and philosophers used psychology as a tool for understanding the nature of God and his relationship with his creatures. During the Renaissance, scientists and thinkers such as Galileo Galilei, Isaac Newton, René Descartes, John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Auguste Comte, Jean-Paul Sartre, Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, William James, Edward Thorndike, B.F. Skinner and others developed theories of psychology that continue to shape our understanding of this field today. Today, psychology is a broad and diverse field that encompasses a wide range of subfields and disciplines. Some of these disciplines include: • Clinical psychology: This field focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders, as well as","{""sections"": [""Introduction to Psychology/Careers in Psychology"", ""Introduction to Psychology/Contemporary Psychology""], ""pages"": [""28"", ""29"", ""20""]}"

1.4 Careers in Psychology
Clive Wearing is an accomplished musician who lost his ability to form new memories when
he became sick at the age of 46. While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember
what he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is
associated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend’s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John
Nash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would
tell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended
for him. He also began to hear voices and became suspicious of the people around him. Soon thereafter, Nash
was diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a state-run mental institution (O’Connor & Robertson,
1Introduction to Psychology
2002). Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these
experiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain’s internal
processes and people’s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of
psychology has explored these questions.
1.1 What Is Psychology?
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Define psychology
• Understand the merits of an education in psychology
What is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology
explores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists
use the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question
about how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the
phenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or
group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over
time. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes
observations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then
published or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.
Scientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because
it is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We
must ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However,
we can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus,
psychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.
In general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot
arrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the
mind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific
method is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on
observation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or
previous authorities.
It was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this
time, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is,
at its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological
organism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore,
psychology is also a social science.
WHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?
Often, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to
learn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course
because it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as
nursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare
psychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses
across the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology
majors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook’s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality
and political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About
6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S.
Department of Education, 2016).

An education in psychology is valuable for a number of reasons. Psychology students hone critical thinking
skills and are trained in the use of the scientific method. Critical thinking is the active application of a set of
skills to information for the understanding and evaluation of that information. The evaluation of
information—assessing its reliability and usefulness— is an important skill in a world full of competing “facts,”
many of which are designed to be misleading. For example, critical thinking involves maintaining an attitude
of skepticism, recognizing internal biases, making use of logical thinking, asking appropriate questions, and
making observations. Psychology students also can develop better communication skills during the course of
their undergraduate coursework (American Psychological Association, 2011). Together, these factors increase
students’ scientific literacy and prepare students to critically evaluate the various sources of information they
encounter.
In addition to these broad-based skills, psychology students come to understand the complex factors that
shape one’s behavior. They appreciate the interaction of our biology, our environment, and our experiences in
determining who we are and how we will behave. They learn about basic principles that guide how we think
and behave, and they come to recognize the tremendous diversity that exists across individuals and across
cultural boundaries (American Psychological Association, 2011).

1.2 History of Psychology
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Understand the importance of Wundt and James in the development of psychology
• Appreciate Freud’s influence on psychology
• Understand the basic tenets of Gestalt psychology
• Appreciate the important role that behaviorism played in psychology’s history
• Understand basic tenets of humanism
• Understand how the cognitive revolution shifted psychology’s focus back to the mind
Psychology is a relatively young science with its experimental roots in the 19th century, compared, for
example, to human physiology, which dates much earlier. As mentioned, anyone interested in exploring issues
related to the mind generally did so in a philosophical context prior to the 19th century. Two 19th century
scholars, Wilhelm Wundt and William James, are generally credited as being the founders of psychology as a
science and academic discipline that was distinct from philosophy. This section will provide an overview of the
shifts in paradigms that have influenced psychology from Wundt and James through today.
Wundt and Structuralism
Wilhelm Wundt (1832–1920) was a German scientist who was the first person to be referred to as a
psychologist. His famous book entitled Principles of Physiological Psychology was published in 1873. Wundt
viewed psychology as a scientific study of conscious experience, and he believed that the goal of psychology
was to identify components of consciousness and how those components combined to result in our conscious
experience. Wundt used introspection (he called it “internal perception”), a process by which someone
examines their own conscious experience as objectively as possible, making the human mind like any other
aspect of nature that a scientist observed. He believed in the notion of voluntarism—that people have free will
and should know the intentions of a psychological experiment if they were participating (Danziger, 1980).
Wundt considered his version experimental introspection; he used instruments such as those that measured
reaction time. He also wrote Volkerpsychologie in 1904 in which he suggested that psychology should include
the study of culture, as it involves the study of people. Edward Titchener, one of his students, went on to
1.2 • History of Psychology 9
develop structuralism. Its focus was on the contents of mental processes rather than their function (Pickren &
Rutherford, 2010). Wundt established his psychology laboratory at the University at Leipzig in 1879 (Figure
1.2). In this laboratory, Wundt and his students conducted experiments on, for example, reaction times. A
subject, sometimes in a room isolated from the scientist, would receive a stimulus such as a light, image, or
sound. The subject’s reaction to the stimulus would be to push a button, and an apparatus would record the
time to reaction. Wundt could measure reaction time to one-thousandth of a second (Nicolas & Ferrand, 1999).
FIGURE 1.2 (a) Wilhelm Wundt is credited as one of the founders of psychology. He created the first laboratory for
psychological research. (b) This photo shows him seated and surrounded by fellow researchers and equipment in
his laboratory in Germany.
However, despite his efforts to train individuals in the process of introspection, this process remained highly
subjective, and there was very little agreement between individuals.
Functionalism
William James, John Dewey, and Charles Sanders Peirce helped establish functional psychology (Figure 1.3).
They accepted Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection and viewed this theory as an explanation of an
organism’s characteristics. Key to that theory is the idea that natural selection leads to organisms that are
adapted to their environment, including their behavior. Adaptation means that a trait of an organism has a
function for the survival and reproduction of the individual, because it has been naturally selected. As James
saw it, psychology’s purpose was to study the function of behavior in the world, and as such, his perspective
was known as functionalism. Functionalism focused on how mental activities helped an organism fit into its
environment. Functionalism has a second, more subtle meaning in that functionalists were more interested in
the operation of the whole mind rather than of its individual parts, which were the focus of structuralism. Like
Wundt, James believed that introspection could serve as one means by which someone might study mental
activities, but James also relied on more objective measures, including the use of various recording devices,
and examinations of concrete products of mental activities and of anatomy and physiology (Gordon, 1995).

FIGURE 1.7 Maslow’s hierarchy of needs is shown.
Carl Rogers (1902–1987) was also an American psychologist who, like Maslow, emphasized the potential for
good that exists within all people (Figure 1.8). Rogers used a therapeutic technique known as client-centered
therapy in helping his clients deal with problematic issues that resulted in their seeking psychotherapy. Unlike
a psychoanalytic approach in which the therapist plays an important role in interpreting what conscious
behavior reveals about the unconscious mind, client-centered therapy involves the patient taking a lead role in
the therapy session. Rogers believed that a therapist needed to display three features to maximize the
effectiveness of this particular approach: unconditional positive regard, genuineness, and empathy.
Unconditional positive regard refers to the fact that the therapist accepts their client for who they are, no
matter what they might say. Provided these factors, Rogers believed that people were more than capable of
dealing with and working through their own issues (Thorne & Henley, 2005).
FIGURE 1.8 Carl Rogers, shown in this portrait, developed a client-centered therapy method that has been
influential in clinical settings. (credit: ""Didius""/Wikimedia Commons)
Humanism has been influential to psychology as a whole. Both Maslow and Rogers are well-known names
among students of psychology (you will read more about both later in this text), and their ideas have influenced
many scholars. Furthermore, Rogers’ client-centered approach to therapy is still commonly used in
psychotherapeutic settings today (O’hara, n.d.)

The Cognitive Revolution
Behaviorism’s emphasis on objectivity and focus on external behavior had pulled psychologists’ attention away
from the mind for a prolonged period of time. The early work of the humanistic psychologists redirected
attention to the individual human as a whole, and as a conscious and self-aware being. By the 1950s, new
disciplinary perspectives in linguistics, neuroscience, and computer science were emerging, and these areas
revived interest in the mind as a focus of scientific inquiry. This particular perspective has come to be known
as the cognitive revolution (Miller, 2003). By 1967, Ulric Neisser published the first textbook entitled Cognitive
Psychology, which served as a core text in cognitive psychology courses around the country (Thorne & Henley,
2005).
Although no one person is entirely responsible for starting the cognitive revolution, Noam Chomsky was very
influential in the early days of this movement (Figure 1.9). Chomsky (1928–), an American linguist, was
dissatisfied with the influence that behaviorism had had on psychology. He believed that psychology’s focus on
behavior was short-sighted and that the field had to re-incorporate mental functioning into its purview if it
were to offer any meaningful contributions to understanding behavior (Miller, 2003).
FIGURE 1.9 Noam Chomsky was very influential in beginning the cognitive revolution. In 2010, this mural honoring
him was put up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (credit: Robert Moran)
European psychology had never really been as influenced by behaviorism as had American psychology; and
thus, the cognitive revolution helped reestablish lines of communication between European psychologists and
their American counterparts. Furthermore, psychologists began to cooperate with scientists in other fields,
like anthropology, linguistics, computer science, and neuroscience, among others. This interdisciplinary
approach often was referred to as the cognitive sciences, and the influence and prominence of this particular
perspective resonates in modern-day psychology (Miller, 2003).
Feminist Psychology
The science of psychology has had an impact on human wellbeing, both positive and negative. The dominant
influence of Western, White, and male academics in the early history of psychology meant that psychology
developed with the biases inherent in those individuals, which often had negative consequences for members of
society who were not White or male. Women, members of ethnic minorities in both the United States and other
countries, and individuals with sexual orientations other than straight had difficulties entering the field of
psychology and therefore influencing its development. They also suffered from the attitudes of White male
psychologists who were not immune to the nonscientific attitudes prevalent in the society in which they
DIG DEEPER

developed and worked. Until the 1960s, the science of psychology was largely a “womanless” psychology
(Crawford & Marecek, 1989), meaning that few women were able to practice psychology, so they had little
influence on what was studied. In addition, the experimental subjects of psychology were mostly men, which
resulted from underlying assumptions that gender had no influence on psychology and that women were not of
sufficient interest to study.
An article by Naomi Weisstein, first published in 1968 (Weisstein, 1993), stimulated a feminist revolution in
psychology by presenting a critique of psychology as a science. She also specifically criticized male psychologists
for constructing the psychology of women entirely out of their own cultural biases and without careful
experimental tests to verify any of their characterizations of women. Weisstein used, as examples, statements by
prominent psychologists in the 1960s, such as this quote by Bruno Bettleheim: “We must start with the
realization that, as much as women want to be good scientists or engineers, they want first and foremost to be
womanly companions of men and to be mothers.” Weisstein’s critique formed the foundation for the subsequent
development of a feminist psychology that attempted to be free of the influence of male cultural biases on our
knowledge of the psychology of women.
Crawford & Marecek (1989) identify several feminist approaches to psychology that can be described as feminist
psychology. These include re-evaluating and discovering the contributions of women to the history of psychology,
studying psychological gender differences, and questioning the male bias present across the practice of the
scientific approach to knowledge.
Multicultural And Cross-Cultural Psychology
Culture impacts individuals, groups, and society. An ongoing issue researchers are trying to correct is that
certain populations have been over-studied and the results of these studies have been applied to other
populations. For example, Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan discuss how WEIRD societies have been
overstudied and the results have been wrongly applied to non-WEIRD societies (2010). WEIRD stands for
western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic. Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan found that there are
many differences between people in the WEIRD group and people in less industrialized, less urban, and non-
Western societies. These differences occur in a variety of areas, including perception, cooperation, and moral
reasoning. That is, people vary depending on their culture and environment. Multicultural psychologists
develop theories and conduct research with diverse populations, typically within one country. Cross-cultural
psychologists compare populations across countries, such as participants from the United States compared to
participants from China.
In 1920, Francis Cecil Sumner was the first African American to receive a PhD in psychology in the United
States. Sumner established a psychology degree program at Howard University, leading to the education of a
new generation of African American psychologists (Black, Spence, and Omari, 2004). Much of the work of early
psychologists from diverse backgrounds was dedicated to challenging intelligence testing and promoting
innovative educational methods for children. George I. Sanchez contested such testing with Mexican American
children. As a psychologist of Mexican heritage, he pointed out that the language and cultural barriers in
testing were keeping children from equal opportunities (Guthrie, 1998). By 1940, he was teaching with his
doctoral degree at University of Texas at Austin and challenging segregated educational practices (Romo,
1986).
Two famous African American researchers and psychologists are Mamie Phipps Clark and her husband,
Kenneth Clark. They are best known for their studies conducted on African American children and doll
preference, research that was instrumental in the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court desegregation
case. The Clarks applied their research to social services and opened the first child guidance center in Harlem
(American Psychological Association, 2019).

The American Psychological Association has several ethnically based organizations for professional
psychologists that facilitate interactions among members. Since psychologists belonging to specific ethnic
groups or cultures have the most interest in studying the psychology of their communities, these organizations
provide an opportunity for the growth of research on the interplay between culture and psychology.
WOMEN IN PSYCHOLOGY
Although rarely given credit, women have been contributing to psychology since its inception as a field of
study. In 1894, Margaret Floy Washburn was the first woman awarded the doctoral degree in psychology. She
wrote The Animal Mind: A Textbook of Comparative Psychology, and it was the standard in the field for over 20
years. In the mid 1890s, Mary Whiton Calkins completed all requirements toward the PhD in psychology, but
Harvard University refused to award her that degree because she was a woman. She had been taught and
mentored by William James, who tried and failed to convince Harvard to award her the doctoral degree. Her
memory research studied primacy and recency (Madigan & O’Hara, 1992), and she also wrote about how
structuralism and functionalism both explained self-psychology (Calkins, 1906).
Another influential woman, Mary Cover Jones, conducted a study she considered to be a sequel to John B.
Watson’s study of Little Albert (you’ll learn about this study in the chapter on Learning). Jones unconditioned
fear in Little Peter, who had been afraid of rabbits (Jones, 1924).
Ethnic minority women contributing to the field of psychology include Martha Bernal and Inez Beverly Prosser;
their studies were related to education. Bernal, the first Latina to earn her doctoral degree in psychology
(1962) conducted much of her research with Mexican American children. Prosser was the first African
American woman awarded the PhD in 1933 at the University of Cincinnati (Benjamin, Henry, & McMahon,
2005).
1.3 Contemporary Psychology
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Appreciate the diversity of interests and foci within psychology
• Understand basic interests and applications in each of the described areas of psychology
• Demonstrate familiarity with some of the major concepts or important figures in each of the described areas of
psychology
Contemporary psychology is a diverse field that is influenced by all of the historical perspectives described in
the preceding section. Reflective of the discipline’s diversity is the diversity seen within the American
Psychological Association (APA). The APA is a professional organization representing psychologists in the
United States. The APA is the largest organization of psychologists in the world, and its mission is to advance
and disseminate psychological knowledge for the betterment of people. There are 54 divisions within the APA,
representing a wide variety of specialties that range from Societies for the Psychology of Religion and
Spirituality to Exercise and Sport Psychology to Behavioral Neuroscience and Comparative Psychology.
Reflecting the diversity of the field of psychology itself, members, affiliate members, and associate members
span the spectrum from students to doctoral-level psychologists, and come from a variety of places including
educational settings, criminal justice, hospitals, the armed forces, and industry (American Psychological
Association, 2014). G. Stanley Hall was the first president of the APA. Before he earned his doctoral degree, he
was an adjunct instructor at Wilberforce University, a historically Black college/university (HBCU), while
serving as faculty at Antioch College. Hall went on to work under William James, earning his PhD. Eventually,

he became the first president of Clark University in Massachusetts when it was founded (Pickren & Rutherford,
2010).
The Association for Psychological Science (APS) was founded in 1988 and seeks to advance the scientific
orientation of psychology. Its founding resulted from disagreements between members of the scientific and
clinical branches of psychology within the APA. The APS publishes five research journals and engages in
education and advocacy with funding agencies. A significant proportion of its members are international,
although the majority is located in the United States. Other organizations provide networking and
collaboration opportunities for professionals of several ethnic or racial groups working in psychology, such as
the National Latina/o Psychological Association (NLPA), the Asian American Psychological Association (AAPA),
the Association of Black Psychologists (ABPsi), and the Society of Indian Psychologists (SIP). Most of these
groups are also dedicated to studying psychological and social issues within their specific communities.
This section will provide an overview of the major subdivisions within psychology today in the order in which
they are introduced throughout the remainder of this textbook. This is not meant to be an exhaustive listing,
but it will provide insight into the major areas of research and practice of modern-day psychologists.

Biopsychology and Evolutionary Psychology
As the name suggests, biopsychology explores how our biology influences our behavior. While biological
psychology is a broad field, many biological psychologists want to understand how the structure and function
of the nervous system is related to behavior (Figure 1.10). As such, they often combine the research strategies
of both psychologists and physiologists to accomplish this goal (as discussed in Carlson, 2013).
FIGURE 1.10 Biological psychologists study how the structure and function of the nervous system generate
behavior.
The research interests of biological psychologists span a number of domains, including but not limited to,
1.3 • Contemporary Psychology 19
In addition to clinical scales, the tests also have validity and reliability scales. (Recall the concepts of reliability
and validity from your study of psychological research.) One of the validity scales, the Lie Scale (or “L” Scale),
consists of 15 items and is used to ascertain whether the respondent is “faking good” (underreporting
psychological problems to appear healthier). For example, if someone responds “yes” to a number of
unrealistically positive items such as “I have never told a lie,” they may be trying to “fake good” or appear
better than they actually are.
Reliability scales test an instrument’s consistency over time, assuring that if you take the MMPI-2-RF today and
then again 5 years later, your two scores will be similar. Beutler, Nussbaum, and Meredith (1988) gave the
MMPI to newly recruited police officers and then to the same police officers 2 years later. After 2 years on the
job, police officers’ responses indicated an increased vulnerability to alcoholism, somatic symptoms (vague,
unexplained physical complaints), and anxiety. When the test was given an additional 2 years later (4 years
after starting on the job), the results suggested high risk for alcohol-related difficulties.
Projective Tests
Another method for assessment of personality is projective testing. This kind of test relies on one of the
defense mechanisms proposed by Freud—projection—as a way to assess unconscious processes. During this
type of testing, a series of ambiguous cards is shown to the person being tested, who then is encouraged to
project their feelings, impulses, and desires onto the cards—by telling a story, interpreting an image, or
completing a sentence. Many projective tests have undergone standardization procedures (for example, Exner,
2002) and can be used to access whether someone has unusual thoughts or a high level of anxiety, or is likely
to become volatile. Some examples of projective tests are the Rorschach Inkblot Test, the Thematic
Apperception Test (TAT), the Contemporized-Themes Concerning Blacks test, the TEMAS (Tell-Me-A-Story),
and the Rotter Incomplete Sentence Blank (RISB). Projective tests are less subject to intentional distortion; it is
hard to fake “good"" because it is not obvious what a ""good” answer is. Projective tests are more time
consuming for the evaluator than self-report inventories. If an evaluator scores the Rorschach using the Exner
scoring system, the test is considered a valid and reliable measure. However, the validity of the other projective
tests is questionable, and the results are often not usable for court cases (Goldstein, n.d.).
The Rorschach Inkblot Test was developed in 1921 by a Swiss psychologist named Hermann Rorschach
(pronounced “ROAR-shock”). It is a series of symmetrical inkblot cards that are presented to a client by a
psychologist. Upon presentation of each card, the psychologist asks the client, “What might this be?” What the
test-taker sees reveals unconscious feelings and struggles (Piotrowski, 1987; Weiner, 2003). The Rorschach
has been standardized using the Exner system and is effective in measuring depression, psychosis, and
anxiety.
A second projective test is the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT), created in the 1930s by Henry Murray, an
American psychologist, and a psychoanalyst named Christiana Morgan. A person taking the TAT is shown
8–12 ambiguous pictures and is asked to tell a story about each picture (Figure 11.18). The stories give insight
into their social world, revealing hopes, fears, interests, and goals. The storytelling format helps to lower a
person’s resistance divulging unconscious personal details (Cramer, 2004). The TAT has been used in clinical
settings to evaluate psychological disorders; more recently, it has been used in counseling settings to help
clients gain a better understanding of themselves and achieve personal growth. Standardization of test
administration is virtually nonexistent among clinicians, and the test tends to be modest to low on validity and
reliability (Aronow, Weiss, & Rezinkoff, 2001; Lilienfeld, Wood, & Garb, 2000). Despite these shortcomings, the
TAT has been one of the most widely used projective tests.

A third projective test is the Rotter Incomplete Sentence Blank (RISB) developed by Julian Rotter in 1950
(recall his theory of locus of control, covered earlier in this chapter). There are three forms of this test for use
with different age groups: the school form, the college form, and the adult form. The tests include 40
incomplete sentences that people are asked to complete as quickly as possible (Figure 11.19). The average
time for completing the test is approximately 20 minutes, as responses are only 1–2 words in length. This test
is similar to a word association test, and like other types of projective tests, it is presumed that responses will
reveal desires, fears, and struggles. The RISB is used in screening college students for adjustment problems
and in career counseling (Holaday, Smith, & Sherry, 2010; Rotter & Rafferty 1950).
FIGURE 11.19 These incomplete sentences resemble the types of questions on the RISB. How would you complete
these sentences?
For many decades, these traditional projective tests have been used in cross-cultural personality assessments.
However, it was found that test bias limited their usefulness (Hoy-Watkins & Jenkins-Moore, 2008). It is
difficult to assess the personalities and lifestyles of members of widely divergent ethnic/cultural groups using
personality instruments based on data from a single culture or race (Hoy-Watkins & Jenkins-Moore, 2008). For
example, when the TAT was used with African-American test takers, the result was often shorter story length
and low levels of cultural identification (Duzant, 2005). Therefore, it was vital to develop other personality
assessments that explored factors such as race, language, and level of acculturation (Hoy-Watkins & Jenkins-
Moore, 2008). To address this need, Robert Williams developed the first culturally specific projective test
designed to reflect the everyday life experiences of African Americans (Hoy-Watkins & Jenkins-Moore, 2008).
The updated version of the instrument is the Contemporized-Themes Concerning Blacks Test (C-TCB)
(Williams, 1972). The C-TCB contains 20 color images that show scenes of African-American lifestyles. When
the C-TCB was compared with the TAT for African Americans, it was found that use of the C-TCB led to
increased story length, higher degrees of positive feelings, and stronger identification with the C-TCB (Hoy,
1997; Hoy-Watkins & Jenkins-Moore, 2008).

The TEMAS Multicultural Thematic Apperception Test is another tool designed to be culturally relevant to
minority groups, especially Hispanic youths. TEMAS—standing for “Tell Me a Story” but also a play on the
Spanish word temas (themes)—uses images and storytelling cues that relate to minority culture (Constantino,
1982).

Summary
11.1 What Is Personality?
Personality has been studied for over 2,000 years, beginning with Hippocrates. More recent theories of
personality have been proposed, including Freud’s psychodynamic perspective, which holds that personality is
formed through early childhood experiences. Other perspectives then emerged in reaction to the
psychodynamic perspective, including the learning, humanistic, biological, trait, and cultural perspectives.
11.2 Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective
Sigmund Freud presented the first comprehensive theory of personality. He was also the first to recognize that
much of our mental life takes place outside of our conscious awareness. Freud also proposed three
components to our personality: the id, ego, and superego. The job of the ego is to balance the sexual and
aggressive drives of the id with the moral ideal of the superego. Freud also said that personality develops
through a series of psychosexual stages. In each stage, pleasure focuses on a specific erogenous zone. Failure
to resolve a stage can lead one to become fixated in that stage, leading to unhealthy personality traits.
Successful resolution of the stages leads to a healthy adult.
11.3 Neo-Freudians: Adler, Erikson, Jung, and Horney
The neo-Freudians were psychologists whose work followed from Freud’s. They generally agreed with Freud
that childhood experiences matter, but they decreased the emphasis on sex and focused more on the social

The word “psychology” comes from two Greek words, “psyche” and “logos,” which mean “mind” or “thinking.” Psychologists are interested in how the mind works and how we think and feel. They study the mental processes that occur in the brain, such as perception, attention, memory, thinking, problem solving, emotion, motivation, learning, decision making, self-regulation, personality, social behavior, etc. Psychologists use a variety of methods to study these processes, including observation, experiments, surveys, interviews, questionnaires, brain imaging, neuropsychology, cognitive neuroscience, psychometrics, clinical psychology, developmental psychology, ethnopsychology and social psychology. Psychology has a long and rich history. It has been practiced for thousands of years in many different cultures and societies. For example, in ancient Greece, Plato and Aristotle studied psychology in order to understand the nature of human beings and their relationships with each other and with their environment. In the Middle Ages, Christian theologians and philosophers used psychology as a tool for understanding the nature of God and his relationship with his creatures. During the Renaissance, scientists and thinkers such as Galileo Galilei, Isaac Newton, René Descartes, John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Auguste Comte, Jean-Paul Sartre, Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, William James, Edward Thorndike, B.F. Skinner and others developed theories of psychology that continue to shape our understanding of this field today. Today, psychology is a broad and diverse field that encompasses a wide range of subfields and disciplines. Some of these disciplines include: • Clinical psychology: This field focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders, as well as","{""sections"": [""Introduction to Psychology/Careers in Psychology"", ""Social Psychology/What Is Social Psychology?"", ""Introduction to Psychology/Contemporary Psychology""], ""pages"": [""29"", ""402"", ""20""]}"

1.4 Careers in Psychology
Clive Wearing is an accomplished musician who lost his ability to form new memories when
he became sick at the age of 46. While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember
what he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is
associated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend’s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John
Nash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would
tell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended
for him. He also began to hear voices and became suspicious of the people around him. Soon thereafter, Nash
was diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a state-run mental institution (O’Connor & Robertson,
1Introduction to Psychology
2002). Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these
experiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain’s internal
processes and people’s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of
psychology has explored these questions.
1.1 What Is Psychology?
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Define psychology
• Understand the merits of an education in psychology
What is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology
explores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists
use the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question
about how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the
phenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or
group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over
time. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes
observations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then
published or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.
Scientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because
it is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We
must ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However,
we can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus,
psychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.
In general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot
arrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the
mind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific
method is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on
observation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or
previous authorities.
It was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this
time, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is,
at its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological
organism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore,
psychology is also a social science.
WHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?
Often, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to
learn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course
because it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as
nursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare
psychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses
across the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology
majors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook’s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality
and political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About
6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S.
Department of Education, 2016).

An education in psychology is valuable for a number of reasons. Psychology students hone critical thinking
skills and are trained in the use of the scientific method. Critical thinking is the active application of a set of
skills to information for the understanding and evaluation of that information. The evaluation of
information—assessing its reliability and usefulness— is an important skill in a world full of competing “facts,”
many of which are designed to be misleading. For example, critical thinking involves maintaining an attitude
of skepticism, recognizing internal biases, making use of logical thinking, asking appropriate questions, and
making observations. Psychology students also can develop better communication skills during the course of
their undergraduate coursework (American Psychological Association, 2011). Together, these factors increase
students’ scientific literacy and prepare students to critically evaluate the various sources of information they
encounter.
In addition to these broad-based skills, psychology students come to understand the complex factors that
shape one’s behavior. They appreciate the interaction of our biology, our environment, and our experiences in
determining who we are and how we will behave. They learn about basic principles that guide how we think
and behave, and they come to recognize the tremendous diversity that exists across individuals and across
cultural boundaries (American Psychological Association, 2011).

1.2 History of Psychology
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Understand the importance of Wundt and James in the development of psychology
• Appreciate Freud’s influence on psychology
• Understand the basic tenets of Gestalt psychology
• Appreciate the important role that behaviorism played in psychology’s history
• Understand basic tenets of humanism
• Understand how the cognitive revolution shifted psychology’s focus back to the mind
Psychology is a relatively young science with its experimental roots in the 19th century, compared, for
example, to human physiology, which dates much earlier. As mentioned, anyone interested in exploring issues
related to the mind generally did so in a philosophical context prior to the 19th century. Two 19th century
scholars, Wilhelm Wundt and William James, are generally credited as being the founders of psychology as a
science and academic discipline that was distinct from philosophy. This section will provide an overview of the
shifts in paradigms that have influenced psychology from Wundt and James through today.
Wundt and Structuralism
Wilhelm Wundt (1832–1920) was a German scientist who was the first person to be referred to as a
psychologist. His famous book entitled Principles of Physiological Psychology was published in 1873. Wundt
viewed psychology as a scientific study of conscious experience, and he believed that the goal of psychology
was to identify components of consciousness and how those components combined to result in our conscious
experience. Wundt used introspection (he called it “internal perception”), a process by which someone
examines their own conscious experience as objectively as possible, making the human mind like any other
aspect of nature that a scientist observed. He believed in the notion of voluntarism—that people have free will
and should know the intentions of a psychological experiment if they were participating (Danziger, 1980).
Wundt considered his version experimental introspection; he used instruments such as those that measured
reaction time. He also wrote Volkerpsychologie in 1904 in which he suggested that psychology should include
the study of culture, as it involves the study of people. Edward Titchener, one of his students, went on to
1.2 • History of Psychology 9
develop structuralism. Its focus was on the contents of mental processes rather than their function (Pickren &
Rutherford, 2010). Wundt established his psychology laboratory at the University at Leipzig in 1879 (Figure
1.2). In this laboratory, Wundt and his students conducted experiments on, for example, reaction times. A
subject, sometimes in a room isolated from the scientist, would receive a stimulus such as a light, image, or
sound. The subject’s reaction to the stimulus would be to push a button, and an apparatus would record the
time to reaction. Wundt could measure reaction time to one-thousandth of a second (Nicolas & Ferrand, 1999).
FIGURE 1.2 (a) Wilhelm Wundt is credited as one of the founders of psychology. He created the first laboratory for
psychological research. (b) This photo shows him seated and surrounded by fellow researchers and equipment in
his laboratory in Germany.
However, despite his efforts to train individuals in the process of introspection, this process remained highly
subjective, and there was very little agreement between individuals.
Functionalism
William James, John Dewey, and Charles Sanders Peirce helped establish functional psychology (Figure 1.3).
They accepted Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection and viewed this theory as an explanation of an
organism’s characteristics. Key to that theory is the idea that natural selection leads to organisms that are
adapted to their environment, including their behavior. Adaptation means that a trait of an organism has a
function for the survival and reproduction of the individual, because it has been naturally selected. As James
saw it, psychology’s purpose was to study the function of behavior in the world, and as such, his perspective
was known as functionalism. Functionalism focused on how mental activities helped an organism fit into its
environment. Functionalism has a second, more subtle meaning in that functionalists were more interested in
the operation of the whole mind rather than of its individual parts, which were the focus of structuralism. Like
Wundt, James believed that introspection could serve as one means by which someone might study mental
activities, but James also relied on more objective measures, including the use of various recording devices,
and examinations of concrete products of mental activities and of anatomy and physiology (Gordon, 1995).

FIGURE 1.7 Maslow’s hierarchy of needs is shown.
Carl Rogers (1902–1987) was also an American psychologist who, like Maslow, emphasized the potential for
good that exists within all people (Figure 1.8). Rogers used a therapeutic technique known as client-centered
therapy in helping his clients deal with problematic issues that resulted in their seeking psychotherapy. Unlike
a psychoanalytic approach in which the therapist plays an important role in interpreting what conscious
behavior reveals about the unconscious mind, client-centered therapy involves the patient taking a lead role in
the therapy session. Rogers believed that a therapist needed to display three features to maximize the
effectiveness of this particular approach: unconditional positive regard, genuineness, and empathy.
Unconditional positive regard refers to the fact that the therapist accepts their client for who they are, no
matter what they might say. Provided these factors, Rogers believed that people were more than capable of
dealing with and working through their own issues (Thorne & Henley, 2005).
FIGURE 1.8 Carl Rogers, shown in this portrait, developed a client-centered therapy method that has been
influential in clinical settings. (credit: ""Didius""/Wikimedia Commons)
Humanism has been influential to psychology as a whole. Both Maslow and Rogers are well-known names
among students of psychology (you will read more about both later in this text), and their ideas have influenced
many scholars. Furthermore, Rogers’ client-centered approach to therapy is still commonly used in
psychotherapeutic settings today (O’hara, n.d.)

The Cognitive Revolution
Behaviorism’s emphasis on objectivity and focus on external behavior had pulled psychologists’ attention away
from the mind for a prolonged period of time. The early work of the humanistic psychologists redirected
attention to the individual human as a whole, and as a conscious and self-aware being. By the 1950s, new
disciplinary perspectives in linguistics, neuroscience, and computer science were emerging, and these areas
revived interest in the mind as a focus of scientific inquiry. This particular perspective has come to be known
as the cognitive revolution (Miller, 2003). By 1967, Ulric Neisser published the first textbook entitled Cognitive
Psychology, which served as a core text in cognitive psychology courses around the country (Thorne & Henley,
2005).
Although no one person is entirely responsible for starting the cognitive revolution, Noam Chomsky was very
influential in the early days of this movement (Figure 1.9). Chomsky (1928–), an American linguist, was
dissatisfied with the influence that behaviorism had had on psychology. He believed that psychology’s focus on
behavior was short-sighted and that the field had to re-incorporate mental functioning into its purview if it
were to offer any meaningful contributions to understanding behavior (Miller, 2003).
FIGURE 1.9 Noam Chomsky was very influential in beginning the cognitive revolution. In 2010, this mural honoring
him was put up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (credit: Robert Moran)
European psychology had never really been as influenced by behaviorism as had American psychology; and
thus, the cognitive revolution helped reestablish lines of communication between European psychologists and
their American counterparts. Furthermore, psychologists began to cooperate with scientists in other fields,
like anthropology, linguistics, computer science, and neuroscience, among others. This interdisciplinary
approach often was referred to as the cognitive sciences, and the influence and prominence of this particular
perspective resonates in modern-day psychology (Miller, 2003).
Feminist Psychology
The science of psychology has had an impact on human wellbeing, both positive and negative. The dominant
influence of Western, White, and male academics in the early history of psychology meant that psychology
developed with the biases inherent in those individuals, which often had negative consequences for members of
society who were not White or male. Women, members of ethnic minorities in both the United States and other
countries, and individuals with sexual orientations other than straight had difficulties entering the field of
psychology and therefore influencing its development. They also suffered from the attitudes of White male
psychologists who were not immune to the nonscientific attitudes prevalent in the society in which they

developed and worked. Until the 1960s, the science of psychology was largely a “womanless” psychology
(Crawford & Marecek, 1989), meaning that few women were able to practice psychology, so they had little
influence on what was studied. In addition, the experimental subjects of psychology were mostly men, which
resulted from underlying assumptions that gender had no influence on psychology and that women were not of
sufficient interest to study.
An article by Naomi Weisstein, first published in 1968 (Weisstein, 1993), stimulated a feminist revolution in
psychology by presenting a critique of psychology as a science. She also specifically criticized male psychologists
for constructing the psychology of women entirely out of their own cultural biases and without careful
experimental tests to verify any of their characterizations of women. Weisstein used, as examples, statements by
prominent psychologists in the 1960s, such as this quote by Bruno Bettleheim: “We must start with the
realization that, as much as women want to be good scientists or engineers, they want first and foremost to be
womanly companions of men and to be mothers.” Weisstein’s critique formed the foundation for the subsequent
development of a feminist psychology that attempted to be free of the influence of male cultural biases on our
knowledge of the psychology of women.
Crawford & Marecek (1989) identify several feminist approaches to psychology that can be described as feminist
psychology. These include re-evaluating and discovering the contributions of women to the history of psychology,
studying psychological gender differences, and questioning the male bias present across the practice of the
scientific approach to knowledge.
Multicultural And Cross-Cultural Psychology
Culture impacts individuals, groups, and society. An ongoing issue researchers are trying to correct is that
certain populations have been over-studied and the results of these studies have been applied to other
populations. For example, Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan discuss how WEIRD societies have been
overstudied and the results have been wrongly applied to non-WEIRD societies (2010). WEIRD stands for
western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic. Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan found that there are
many differences between people in the WEIRD group and people in less industrialized, less urban, and non-
Western societies. These differences occur in a variety of areas, including perception, cooperation, and moral
reasoning. That is, people vary depending on their culture and environment. Multicultural psychologists
develop theories and conduct research with diverse populations, typically within one country. Cross-cultural
psychologists compare populations across countries, such as participants from the United States compared to
participants from China.
In 1920, Francis Cecil Sumner was the first African American to receive a PhD in psychology in the United
States. Sumner established a psychology degree program at Howard University, leading to the education of a
new generation of African American psychologists (Black, Spence, and Omari, 2004). Much of the work of early
psychologists from diverse backgrounds was dedicated to challenging intelligence testing and promoting
innovative educational methods for children. George I. Sanchez contested such testing with Mexican American
children. As a psychologist of Mexican heritage, he pointed out that the language and cultural barriers in
testing were keeping children from equal opportunities (Guthrie, 1998). By 1940, he was teaching with his
doctoral degree at University of Texas at Austin and challenging segregated educational practices (Romo,
1986).
Two famous African American researchers and psychologists are Mamie Phipps Clark and her husband,
Kenneth Clark. They are best known for their studies conducted on African American children and doll
preference, research that was instrumental in the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court desegregation
case. The Clarks applied their research to social services and opened the first child guidance center in Harlem
(American Psychological Association, 2019).

The American Psychological Association has several ethnically based organizations for professional
psychologists that facilitate interactions among members. Since psychologists belonging to specific ethnic
groups or cultures have the most interest in studying the psychology of their communities, these organizations
provide an opportunity for the growth of research on the interplay between culture and psychology.
WOMEN IN PSYCHOLOGY
Although rarely given credit, women have been contributing to psychology since its inception as a field of
study. In 1894, Margaret Floy Washburn was the first woman awarded the doctoral degree in psychology. She
wrote The Animal Mind: A Textbook of Comparative Psychology, and it was the standard in the field for over 20
years. In the mid 1890s, Mary Whiton Calkins completed all requirements toward the PhD in psychology, but
Harvard University refused to award her that degree because she was a woman. She had been taught and
mentored by William James, who tried and failed to convince Harvard to award her the doctoral degree. Her
memory research studied primacy and recency (Madigan & O’Hara, 1992), and she also wrote about how
structuralism and functionalism both explained self-psychology (Calkins, 1906).
Another influential woman, Mary Cover Jones, conducted a study she considered to be a sequel to John B.
Watson’s study of Little Albert (you’ll learn about this study in the chapter on Learning). Jones unconditioned
fear in Little Peter, who had been afraid of rabbits (Jones, 1924).
Ethnic minority women contributing to the field of psychology include Martha Bernal and Inez Beverly Prosser;
their studies were related to education. Bernal, the first Latina to earn her doctoral degree in psychology
(1962) conducted much of her research with Mexican American children. Prosser was the first African
American woman awarded the PhD in 1933 at the University of Cincinnati (Benjamin, Henry, & McMahon,
2005).
1.3 Contemporary Psychology
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Appreciate the diversity of interests and foci within psychology
• Understand basic interests and applications in each of the described areas of psychology
• Demonstrate familiarity with some of the major concepts or important figures in each of the described areas of
psychology
Contemporary psychology is a diverse field that is influenced by all of the historical perspectives described in
the preceding section. Reflective of the discipline’s diversity is the diversity seen within the American
Psychological Association (APA). The APA is a professional organization representing psychologists in the
United States. The APA is the largest organization of psychologists in the world, and its mission is to advance
and disseminate psychological knowledge for the betterment of people. There are 54 divisions within the APA,
representing a wide variety of specialties that range from Societies for the Psychology of Religion and
Spirituality to Exercise and Sport Psychology to Behavioral Neuroscience and Comparative Psychology.
Reflecting the diversity of the field of psychology itself, members, affiliate members, and associate members
span the spectrum from students to doctoral-level psychologists, and come from a variety of places including
educational settings, criminal justice, hospitals, the armed forces, and industry (American Psychological
Association, 2014). G. Stanley Hall was the first president of the APA. Before he earned his doctoral degree, he
was an adjunct instructor at Wilberforce University, a historically Black college/university (HBCU), while
serving as faculty at Antioch College. Hall went on to work under William James, earning his PhD. Eventually,

he became the first president of Clark University in Massachusetts when it was founded (Pickren & Rutherford,
2010).
The Association for Psychological Science (APS) was founded in 1988 and seeks to advance the scientific
orientation of psychology. Its founding resulted from disagreements between members of the scientific and
clinical branches of psychology within the APA. The APS publishes five research journals and engages in
education and advocacy with funding agencies. A significant proportion of its members are international,
although the majority is located in the United States. Other organizations provide networking and
collaboration opportunities for professionals of several ethnic or racial groups working in psychology, such as
the National Latina/o Psychological Association (NLPA), the Asian American Psychological Association (AAPA),
the Association of Black Psychologists (ABPsi), and the Society of Indian Psychologists (SIP). Most of these
groups are also dedicated to studying psychological and social issues within their specific communities.
This section will provide an overview of the major subdivisions within psychology today in the order in which
they are introduced throughout the remainder of this textbook. This is not meant to be an exhaustive listing,
but it will provide insight into the major areas of research and practice of modern-day psychologists.

Biopsychology and Evolutionary Psychology
As the name suggests, biopsychology explores how our biology influences our behavior. While biological
psychology is a broad field, many biological psychologists want to understand how the structure and function
of the nervous system is related to behavior (Figure 1.10). As such, they often combine the research strategies
of both psychologists and physiologists to accomplish this goal (as discussed in Carlson, 2013).
FIGURE 1.10 Biological psychologists study how the structure and function of the nervous system generate
behavior.
The research interests of biological psychologists span a number of domains, including but not limited to,
1.3 • Contemporary Psychology 19
They often are called Likert scales after their developer, Rensis Likert (1932) (Figure 11.16). Self-report
inventories are generally easy to administer and cost effective. There is also an increased likelihood of test
takers being inclined to answer in ways that are intentionally or unintentionally more socially desirable,
exaggerated, biased, or misleading. For example, someone applying for a job will likely try to present
themselves in a positive light, perhaps as an even better candidate than they actually are.
FIGURE 11.16 If you’ve ever taken a survey, you are probably familiar with Likert-type scale questions. Most
personality inventories employ these types of response scales.
One of the most widely used personality inventories is the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory
(MMPI), first published in 1943, with 504 true/false questions, and updated to the MMPI-2 in 1989, with 567
questions. The original MMPI was based on a small, limited sample, composed mostly of Minnesota farmers
and psychiatric patients; the revised inventory was based on a more representative, national sample to allow
for better standardization. The MMPI-2 takes 1–2 hours to complete. Responses are scored to produce a
clinical profile composed of 10 scales: hypochondriasis, depression, hysteria, psychopathic deviance (social
deviance), masculinity versus femininity, paranoia, psychasthenia (obsessive/compulsive qualities),
schizophrenia, hypomania, and social introversion. There is also a scale to ascertain risk factors for alcohol
abuse. In 2008, the test was again revised, using more advanced methods, to the MMPI-2-RF. This version
takes about one-half the time to complete and has only 338 questions (Figure 11.17). Despite the new test’s
advantages, the MMPI-2 is more established and is still more widely used. Typically, the tests are administered
by computer. Although the MMPI was originally developed to assist in the clinical diagnosis of psychological
disorders, it is now also used for occupational screening, such as in law enforcement, and in college, career,
and marital counseling (Ben-Porath & Tellegen, 2008).
FIGURE 11.17 These true/false questions resemble the kinds of questions you would find on the MMPI.
11.9 • Personality Assessment 387
In addition to clinical scales, the tests also have validity and reliability scales. (Recall the concepts of reliability
and validity from your study of psychological research.) One of the validity scales, the Lie Scale (or “L” Scale),
consists of 15 items and is used to ascertain whether the respondent is “faking good” (underreporting
psychological problems to appear healthier). For example, if someone responds “yes” to a number of
unrealistically positive items such as “I have never told a lie,” they may be trying to “fake good” or appear
better than they actually are.
Reliability scales test an instrument’s consistency over time, assuring that if you take the MMPI-2-RF today and
then again 5 years later, your two scores will be similar. Beutler, Nussbaum, and Meredith (1988) gave the
MMPI to newly recruited police officers and then to the same police officers 2 years later. After 2 years on the
job, police officers’ responses indicated an increased vulnerability to alcoholism, somatic symptoms (vague,
unexplained physical complaints), and anxiety. When the test was given an additional 2 years later (4 years
after starting on the job), the results suggested high risk for alcohol-related difficulties.
Projective Tests
Another method for assessment of personality is projective testing. This kind of test relies on one of the
defense mechanisms proposed by Freud—projection—as a way to assess unconscious processes. During this
type of testing, a series of ambiguous cards is shown to the person being tested, who then is encouraged to
project their feelings, impulses, and desires onto the cards—by telling a story, interpreting an image, or
completing a sentence. Many projective tests have undergone standardization procedures (for example, Exner,
2002) and can be used to access whether someone has unusual thoughts or a high level of anxiety, or is likely
to become volatile. Some examples of projective tests are the Rorschach Inkblot Test, the Thematic
Apperception Test (TAT), the Contemporized-Themes Concerning Blacks test, the TEMAS (Tell-Me-A-Story),
and the Rotter Incomplete Sentence Blank (RISB). Projective tests are less subject to intentional distortion; it is
hard to fake “good"" because it is not obvious what a ""good” answer is. Projective tests are more time
consuming for the evaluator than self-report inventories. If an evaluator scores the Rorschach using the Exner
scoring system, the test is considered a valid and reliable measure. However, the validity of the other projective
tests is questionable, and the results are often not usable for court cases (Goldstein, n.d.).
The Rorschach Inkblot Test was developed in 1921 by a Swiss psychologist named Hermann Rorschach
(pronounced “ROAR-shock”). It is a series of symmetrical inkblot cards that are presented to a client by a
psychologist. Upon presentation of each card, the psychologist asks the client, “What might this be?” What the
test-taker sees reveals unconscious feelings and struggles (Piotrowski, 1987; Weiner, 2003). The Rorschach
has been standardized using the Exner system and is effective in measuring depression, psychosis, and
anxiety.
A second projective test is the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT), created in the 1930s by Henry Murray, an
American psychologist, and a psychoanalyst named Christiana Morgan. A person taking the TAT is shown
8–12 ambiguous pictures and is asked to tell a story about each picture (Figure 11.18). The stories give insight
into their social world, revealing hopes, fears, interests, and goals. The storytelling format helps to lower a
person’s resistance divulging unconscious personal details (Cramer, 2004). The TAT has been used in clinical
settings to evaluate psychological disorders; more recently, it has been used in counseling settings to help
clients gain a better understanding of themselves and achieve personal growth. Standardization of test
administration is virtually nonexistent among clinicians, and the test tends to be modest to low on validity and
reliability (Aronow, Weiss, & Rezinkoff, 2001; Lilienfeld, Wood, & Garb, 2000). Despite these shortcomings, the
TAT has been one of the most widely used projective tests.

FIGURE 11.18 This image from the Thematic Apperception Tests (TAT) can be used in counseling settings.
A third projective test is the Rotter Incomplete Sentence Blank (RISB) developed by Julian Rotter in 1950
(recall his theory of locus of control, covered earlier in this chapter). There are three forms of this test for use
with different age groups: the school form, the college form, and the adult form. The tests include 40
incomplete sentences that people are asked to complete as quickly as possible (Figure 11.19). The average
time for completing the test is approximately 20 minutes, as responses are only 1–2 words in length. This test
is similar to a word association test, and like other types of projective tests, it is presumed that responses will
reveal desires, fears, and struggles. The RISB is used in screening college students for adjustment problems
and in career counseling (Holaday, Smith, & Sherry, 2010; Rotter & Rafferty 1950).
FIGURE 11.19 These incomplete sentences resemble the types of questions on the RISB. How would you complete
these sentences?
For many decades, these traditional projective tests have been used in cross-cultural personality assessments.
However, it was found that test bias limited their usefulness (Hoy-Watkins & Jenkins-Moore, 2008). It is
difficult to assess the personalities and lifestyles of members of widely divergent ethnic/cultural groups using
personality instruments based on data from a single culture or race (Hoy-Watkins & Jenkins-Moore, 2008). For
example, when the TAT was used with African-American test takers, the result was often shorter story length
and low levels of cultural identification (Duzant, 2005). Therefore, it was vital to develop other personality
assessments that explored factors such as race, language, and level of acculturation (Hoy-Watkins & Jenkins-
Moore, 2008). To address this need, Robert Williams developed the first culturally specific projective test
designed to reflect the everyday life experiences of African Americans (Hoy-Watkins & Jenkins-Moore, 2008).
The updated version of the instrument is the Contemporized-Themes Concerning Blacks Test (C-TCB)
(Williams, 1972). The C-TCB contains 20 color images that show scenes of African-American lifestyles. When
the C-TCB was compared with the TAT for African Americans, it was found that use of the C-TCB led to
increased story length, higher degrees of positive feelings, and stronger identification with the C-TCB (Hoy,
1997; Hoy-Watkins & Jenkins-Moore, 2008).
11.9 • Personality Assessment 389
The TEMAS Multicultural Thematic Apperception Test is another tool designed to be culturally relevant to
minority groups, especially Hispanic youths. TEMAS—standing for “Tell Me a Story” but also a play on the
Spanish word temas (themes)—uses images and storytelling cues that relate to minority culture (Constantino,
1982).

While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember what he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is associated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend’s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John Nash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would tell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended for him. He also began to hear voices in his head that he could not control. When he tried to stop them, they would come back to him, and when he did not want them to, the voices would leave him (Wearing, n.d.). These are just a few of the many examples of how people experience the world around them in ways that are unpredictable and difficult to understand. In this chapter, we will explore what psychology is, what it is not, and how it has evolved over time. We will also look at some common misconceptions about psychology. Finally, we will discuss some careers in psychology and the role that psychology plays in our lives. 2. WHAT IS PSYCHOLOGY? The word “psychology” comes from two Greek words, “psyche” and “logos,” which mean “mind” or “thinking.” Psychologists are interested in how the mind works and how we think and feel. They study the mental processes that occur in the brain, such as perception, attention, memory, thinking, problem solving, emotion, motivation, learning, decision making, self-regulation, personality, social behavior, etc. Psychologists use a variety of methods to study these processes, including observation, experiments, surveys, interviews, questionnaires, brain imaging, neuropsychology, cognitive neuroscience, psychometrics, clinical psychology, developmental psychology, ethnopsychology and social psychology. Psychology has a long and rich history. It has been practiced for thousands of years in many different cultures and societies. For example, in ancient Greece, Plato and Aristotle studied psychology in order to understand the nature of human beings and their relationships with each other and with their environment. In the Middle Ages, Christian theologians and philosophers used psychology as a tool for understanding the nature of God and his relationship with his creatures. During the Renaissance, scientists and thinkers such as Galileo Galilei, Isaac Newton, René Descartes, John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Auguste Comte, Jean-Paul Sartre, Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, William James, Edward Thorndike, B.F. Skinner and others developed theories of psychology that continue to shape our understanding of this field today. Today, psychology is a broad and diverse field that encompasses a wide range of subfields and disciplines.

Few would deny that today’s college students are under a lot of pressure. In addition to many
usual stresses and strains incidental to the college experience (e.g., exams and term papers), students today
are faced with increased college tuitions, burdensome debt, and difficulty finding employment after
graduation. A significant population of non-traditional college students may face additional stressors, such as
raising children or holding down a full-time job while working toward a degree.
Of course, life is filled with many additional challenges beyond those incurred in college or the workplace. We
might have concerns with financial security, difficulties with friends or neighbors, family responsibilities, and
we may not have enough time to do the things we want to do. Even minor hassles—losing things, traffic jams,
and loss of internet service—all involve pressure and demands that can make life seem like a struggle and that
can compromise our sense of well-being. That is, all can be stressful in some way.
Scientific interest in stress, including how we adapt and cope, has been longstanding in psychology; indeed,
after nearly a century of research on the topic, much has been learned and many insights have been
developed. This chapter examines stress and highlights our current understanding of the phenomenon,
including its psychological and physiological natures, its causes and consequences, and the steps we can take
to master stress rather than become its victim.
14Stress, Lifestyle, and Health
14.1 What Is Stress?
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Differentiate between stimulus-based and response-based definitions of stress
• Define stress as a process
• Differentiate between good stress and bad stress
• Describe the early contributions of Walter Cannon and Hans Selye to the stress research field
• Understand the physiological basis of stress and describe the general adaptation syndrome
The term stress as it relates to the human condition first emerged in scientific literature in the 1930s, but it did
not enter the popular vernacular until the 1970s (Lyon, 2012). Today, we often use the term loosely in
describing a variety of unpleasant feeling states; for example, we often say we are stressed out when we feel
frustrated, angry, conflicted, overwhelmed, or fatigued. Despite the widespread use of the term, stress is a
fairly vague concept that is difficult to define with precision.
Researchers have had a difficult time agreeing on an acceptable definition of stress. Some have conceptualized
stress as a demanding or threatening event or situation (e.g., a high-stress job, overcrowding, and long
commutes to work). Such conceptualizations are known as stimulus-based definitions because they
characterize stress as a stimulus that causes certain reactions. Stimulus-based definitions of stress are
problematic, however, because they fail to recognize that people differ in how they view and react to
challenging life events and situations. For example, a conscientious student who has studied diligently all
semester would likely experience less stress during final exams week than would a less responsible,
unprepared student.
Others have conceptualized stress in ways that emphasize the physiological responses that occur when faced
with demanding or threatening situations (e.g., increased arousal). These conceptualizations are referred to as
response-based definitions because they describe stress as a response to environmental conditions. For
example, the endocrinologist Hans Selye, a famous stress researcher, once defined stress as the “response of
the body to any demand, whether it is caused by, or results in, pleasant or unpleasant conditions” (Selye, 1976,
p. 74). Selye’s definition of stress is response-based in that it conceptualizes stress chiefly in terms of the
body’s physiological reaction to any demand that is placed on it. Neither stimulus-based nor response-based
definitions provide a complete definition of stress. Many of the physiological reactions that occur when faced
with demanding situations (e.g., accelerated heart rate) can also occur in response to things that most people
would not consider to be genuinely stressful, such as receiving unanticipated good news: an unexpected
promotion or raise.
A useful way to conceptualize stress is to view it as a process whereby an individual perceives and responds to
events that they appraise as overwhelming or threatening to their well-being (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). A
critical element of this definition is that it emphasizes the importance of how we appraise—that is,
judge—demanding or threatening events (often referred to as stressors); these appraisals, in turn, influence
our reactions to such events. Two kinds of appraisals of a stressor are especially important in this regard:
primary and secondary appraisals. A primary appraisal involves judgment about the degree of potential harm
or threat to well-being that a stressor might entail. A stressor would likely be appraised as a threat if one
anticipates that it could lead to some kind of harm, loss, or other negative consequence; conversely, a stressor
would likely be appraised as a challenge if one believes that it carries the potential for gain or personal growth.
For example, an employee who is promoted to a leadership position would likely perceive the promotion as a
much greater threat if they believed the promotion would lead to excessive work demands than if they viewed
it as an opportunity to gain new skills and grow professionally. Similarly, a college student on the cusp of
graduation may face the change as a threat or a challenge (Figure 14.2).

FIGURE 14.2 Graduating from college and entering the workforce can be viewed as either a threat (loss of financial
support) or a challenge (opportunity for independence and growth). (credit: Timothy Zanker)
The perception of a threat triggers a secondary appraisal: judgment of the options available to cope with a
stressor, as well as perceptions of how effective such options will be (Lyon, 2012) (Figure 14.3). As you may
recall from what you learned about self-efficacy, an individual’s belief in their ability to complete a task is
important (Bandura, 1994). A threat tends to be viewed as less catastrophic if one believes something can be
done about it (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). Imagine that two middle-aged people, Robin and Madhuri, perform
breast self-examinations one morning and each notices a lump on the lower region of their left breast.
Although both view the breast lump as a potential threat (primary appraisal), their secondary appraisals differ
considerably. In considering the breast lump, some of the thoughts racing through Robin’s mind are, “Oh my
God, I could have breast cancer! What if the cancer has spread to the rest of my body and I cannot recover?
What if I have to go through chemotherapy? I’ve heard that experience is awful! What if I have to quit my job?
My partner and I won’t have enough money to pay the mortgage. Oh, this is just horrible…I can’t deal with it!”
On the other hand, Madhuri thinks, “Hmm, this may not be good. Although most times these things turn out to
be benign, I need to have it checked out. If it turns out to be breast cancer, there are doctors who can take care
of it because the medical technology today is quite advanced. I’ll have a lot of different options, and I’ll be just
fine.” Clearly, Robin and Madhuri have different outlooks on what might turn out to be a very serious situation:
Robin seems to think that little could be done about it, whereas Madhuri believes that, worst case scenario, a
number of options that are likely to be effective would be available. As such, Robin would clearly experience
greater stress than would Madhuri.
14.1 • What Is Stress? 487
FIGURE 14.3 When encountering a stressor, a person judges its potential threat (primary appraisal) and then
determines if effective options are available to manage the situation. Stress is likely to result if a stressor is
perceived as extremely threatening or threatening with few or no effective coping options available.
To be sure, some stressors are inherently more stressful than others in that they are more threatening and
leave less potential for variation in cognitive appraisals (e.g., objective threats to one’s health or safety).
Nevertheless, appraisal will still play a role in augmenting or diminishing our reactions to such events (Everly
& Lating, 2002).
If a person appraises an event as harmful and believes that the demands imposed by the event exceed the
available resources to manage or adapt to it, the person will subjectively experience a state of stress. In
contrast, if one does not appraise the same event as harmful or threatening, she is unlikely to experience
stress. According to this definition, environmental events trigger stress reactions by the way they are
interpreted and the meanings they are assigned. In short, stress is largely in the eye of the beholder: it’s not so
much what happens to you as it is how you respond (Selye, 1976).
Good Stress?
Although stress carries a negative connotation, at times it may be of some benefit. Stress can motivate us to do
things in our best interests, such as study for exams, visit the doctor regularly, exercise, and perform to the
best of our ability at work. Indeed, Selye (1974) pointed out that not all stress is harmful. He argued that stress
488 14 • Stress, Lifestyle, and Health
Access for free at openstax.org
can sometimes be a positive, motivating force that can improve the quality of our lives. This kind of stress,
which Selye called eustress (from the Greek eu = “good”), is a good kind of stress associated with positive
feelings, optimal health, and performance. A moderate amount of stress can be beneficial in challenging
situations. For example, athletes may be motivated and energized by pregame stress, and students may
experience similar beneficial stress before a major exam. Indeed, research shows that moderate stress can
enhance both immediate and delayed recall of educational material. Participants in one study who memorized
a scientific text passage showed improved memory of the passage immediately after exposure to a mild
stressor as well as one day following exposure to the stressor (Hupbach & Fieman, 2012).
Increasing one’s level of stress will cause performance to change in a predictable way. As shown in Figure 14.4,
as stress increases, so do performance and general well-being (eustress); when stress levels reach an optimal
level (the highest point of the curve), performance reaches its peak. A person at this stress level is colloquially
at the top of their game, meaning they feel fully energized, focused, and can work with minimal effort and
maximum efficiency. But when stress exceeds this optimal level, it is no longer a positive force—it becomes
excessive and debilitating, or what Selye termed distress (from the Latin dis = “bad”). People who reach this
level of stress feel burned out; they are fatigued, exhausted, and their performance begins to decline. If the
stress remains excessive, health may begin to erode as well (Everly & Lating, 2002). A good example of distress
is severe test anxiety. When students are feeling very stressed about a test, negative emotions combined with
physical symptoms may make concentration difficult, thereby negatively affecting test scores.
FIGURE 14.4 As the stress level increases from low to moderate, so does performance (eustress). At the optimal
level (the peak of the curve), performance has reached its peak. If stress exceeds the optimal level, it will reach the
distress region, where it will become excessive and debilitating, and performance will decline (Everly & Lating,
2002).
The Prevalence of Stress
Stress is everywhere and, as shown in Figure 14.5, it has been on the rise over the last several years. Each of us
is acquainted with stress—some are more familiar than others. In many ways, stress feels like a load you just
can’t carry—a feeling you experience when, for example, you have to drive somewhere in a blizzard, when you
wake up late the morning of an important job interview, when you run out of money before the next pay
period, and before taking an important exam for which you realize you are not fully prepared.
14.1 • What Is Stress? 489
FIGURE 14.5 Nearly half of U.S. adults indicated that their stress levels have increased over the last five years
(Neelakantan, 2013).
Stress is an experience that evokes a variety of responses, including those that are physiological (e.g.,
accelerated heart rate, headaches, or gastrointestinal problems), cognitive (e.g., difficulty concentrating or
making decisions), and behavioral (e.g., drinking alcohol, smoking, or taking actions directed at eliminating
the cause of the stress). Although stress can be positive at times, it can have deleterious health implications,
contributing to the onset and progression of a variety of physical illnesses and diseases (Cohen & Herbert,
1996).
The scientific study of how stress and other psychological factors impact health falls within the realm of health
psychology, a subfield of psychology devoted to understanding the importance of psychological influences on
health, illness, and how people respond when they become ill (Taylor, 1999). Health psychology emerged as a
discipline in the 1970s, a time during which there was increasing awareness of the role behavioral and lifestyle
factors play in the development of illnesses and diseases (Straub, 2007). In addition to studying the connection
between stress and illness, health psychologists investigate issues such as why people make certain lifestyle
choices (e.g., smoking or eating unhealthy food despite knowing the potential adverse health implications of
such behaviors). Health psychologists also design and investigate the effectiveness of interventions aimed at
changing unhealthy behaviors. Perhaps one of the more fundamental tasks of health psychologists is to
identify which groups of people are especially at risk for negative health outcomes, based on psychological or
behavioral factors. For example, measuring differences in stress levels among demographic groups and how
these levels change over time can help identify populations who may have an increased risk for illness or
disease.
Figure 14.6 depicts the results of three national surveys in which several thousand individuals from different
demographic groups completed a brief stress questionnaire; the surveys were administered in 1983, 2006,
and 2009 (Cohen & Janicki-Deverts, 2012). All three surveys demonstrated higher stress in women than in
men. Unemployed individuals reported high levels of stress in all three surveys, as did those with less
education and income; retired persons reported the lowest stress levels. However, from 2006 to 2009 the
greatest increase in stress levels occurred among men, Hispanic people aged 45–64, college graduates, and
those with full-time employment. One interpretation of these findings is that concerns surrounding the
2008–2009 economic downturn (e.g., threat of or actual job loss and substantial loss of retirement savings)
may have been especially stressful to college-educated employed men with limited time remaining in their
working careers.

among different demographic groups during the years 1983, 2006, and 2009. Across categories of sex, age, race,
education level, employment status, and income, stress levels generally show a marked increase over this quarter-
century time span.
Early Contributions to the Study of Stress
As previously stated, scientific interest in stress goes back nearly a century. One of the early pioneers in the
study of stress was Walter Cannon, an eminent American physiologist at Harvard Medical School (Figure 14.7).
In the early part of the 20th century, Cannon was the first to identify the body’s physiological reactions to
stress.

In addition to many usual stresses and strains incidental to the college experience (e.g., exams and term papers), students today are faced with increased college tuitions, burdensome debt, and difficulty finding employment after graduation. A significant population of non-traditional college students may face additional stressors, such as raising children or holding down a full-time job while working toward a degree. Of course, life is filled with many additional challenges beyond those incurred in college or the workplace. We might have concerns with financial security, difficulties with friends or neighbors, family responsibilities, and we may not have enough time to do the things we want to do. Even minor hassles—losing things, traffic jams, and loss of internet service—all involve pressure and demands that can make life seem like a struggle and that can compromise our sense of well-being and happiness. In this chapter, we will explore the concept of stress and how it relates to our daily lives. Stress is an emotional response to an event or situation that is perceived as harmful or threatening. It is a normal part of our lives and can be beneficial in certain situations. For example, stress can motivate us to work harder and to improve our performance. However, when stress becomes chronic, it can have negative effects on our mental and physical health. Stressors are the events or situations that cause stress. They may be internal or external. Internal stressors include problems at home, work, or school, as well as problems with relationships with family members and friends. Externally, they may include natural disasters, wars, political upheavals, natural disasters, financial problems, illness, death, divorce, job loss, etc. The term “stress” is often used interchangeably with “suffering,” but it is important to understand the differences between the two concepts. While suffering may involve physical or emotional pain and discomfort, stress is more than just physical pain or discomfort. When we experience stress, our bodies and minds respond in a variety of ways, including changes in our heart rate, blood pressure, breathing, digestion, immune system function, sleep patterns, energy levels, mood, appetite, memory, concentration, decision-making, etc. These changes can lead to a range of physical and mental health effects, ranging from mild discomfort to serious illness or even death. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to stress management. The key is to identify the specific stressor that is causing you to feel stressed and then to take steps to address it. There are many ways to manage stress, including relaxation techniques, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), mindfulness meditation, exercise, healthy diet, social support, time management, setting realistic goals and expectations, seeking professional help when needed, talking to trusted friends and family members about how you are feeling, getting enough sleep, eating a healthy diet, engaging in regular physical activity, practicing stress-reducing activities such as yoga, tai chi, deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, listening to music or listening to nature sounds, spending time with loved ones, reading a book, writing, playing a musical instrument, taking a hot bath or shower, going for a walk, watching a movie or TV show, doing crossword puzzles or other mentally stimulating activities","{""sections"": [""Stress, Lifestyle, and Health/Stressors""], ""pages"": [""498"", ""500"", ""501""]}"

studied by developmental psychologists. They view development as a lifelong process that can be studied
scientifically across three developmental domains: physical, cognitive development, and psychosocial. There
are several theories of development that focus on the following issues: whether development is continuous or
discontinuous, whether development follows one course or many, and the relative influence of nature versus
nurture on development.
9.2 Lifespan Theories
There are many theories regarding how babies and children grow and develop into happy, healthy adults.
Sigmund Freud suggested that we pass through a series of psychosexual stages in which our energy is focused
on certain erogenous zones on the body. Eric Erikson modified Freud’s ideas and suggested a theory of
psychosocial development. Erikson said that our social interactions and successful completion of social tasks
shape our sense of self. Jean Piaget proposed a theory of cognitive development that explains how children
think and reason as they move through various stages. Finally, Lawrence Kohlberg turned his attention to
moral development. He said that we pass through three levels of moral thinking that build on our cognitive
development.
9.3 Stages of Development
At conception the egg and sperm cell are united to form a zygote, which will begin to divide rapidly. This marks
the beginning of the first stage of prenatal development (germinal stage), which lasts about two weeks. Then
the zygote implants itself into the lining of the uterus, marking the beginning of the second stage of prenatal
development (embryonic stage), which lasts about six weeks. The embryo begins to develop body and organ
structures, and the neural tube forms, which will later become the brain and spinal cord. The third phase of
prenatal development (fetal stage) begins at 9 weeks and lasts until birth. The body, brain, and organs grow
rapidly during this stage. During all stages of pregnancy it is important that the parent receive prenatal care to
reduce health risks to themself and to the developing baby.
Newborn infants weigh about 7.5 pounds. Doctors assess a newborn’s reflexes, such as the sucking, rooting,
and Moro reflexes. Our physical, cognitive, and psychosocial skills grow and change as we move through
developmental stages from infancy through late adulthood. Attachment in infancy is a critical component of
healthy development. Parenting styles have been found to have an effect on childhood outcomes of well-being.
The transition from adolescence to adulthood can be challenging due to the timing of puberty, and due to the
extended amount of time spent in emerging adulthood. Although physical decline begins in middle adulthood,
cognitive decline does not begin until later. Activities that keep the body and mind active can help maintain
good physical and cognitive health as we age. Social supports through family and friends remain important as
we age.
9.4 Death and Dying
Death marks the endpoint of our lifespan. There are many ways that we might react when facing death. Kübler-
Ross developed a five-stage model of grief as a way to explain this process. Many people facing death choose
hospice care, which allows their last days to be spent at home in a comfortable, supportive environment.

remains hidden from us in our unconscious. The information in our unconscious affects our behavior, although we
are unaware of it.
According to Freud, our personality develops from a conflict between two forces: our biological aggressive and
pleasure-seeking drives versus our internal (socialized) control over these drives. Our personality is the result
of our efforts to balance these two competing forces. Freud suggested that we can understand this by
imagining three interacting systems within our minds. He called them the id, ego, and superego (Figure 11.6).
FIGURE 11.6 The job of the ego, or self, is to balance the aggressive/pleasure-seeking drives of the id with the
moral control of the superego.
The unconscious id contains our most primitive drives or urges, and is present from birth. It directs impulses
for hunger, thirst, and sex. Freud believed that the id operates on what he called the “pleasure principle,” in
which the id seeks immediate gratification. Through social interactions with parents and others in a child’s
environment, the ego and superego develop to help control the id. The superego develops as a child interacts
with others, learning the social rules for right and wrong. The superego acts as our conscience; it is our moral
compass that tells us how we should behave. It strives for perfection and judges our behavior, leading to
feelings of pride or—when we fall short of the ideal—feelings of guilt. In contrast to the instinctual id and the
rule-based superego, the ego is the rational part of our personality. It’s what Freud considered to be the self,
and it is the part of our personality that is seen by others. Its job is to balance the demands of the id and
superego in the context of reality; thus, it operates on what Freud called the “reality principle.” The ego helps
the id satisfy its desires in a realistic way.
The id and superego are in constant conflict, because the id wants instant gratification regardless of the
consequences, but the superego tells us that we must behave in socially acceptable ways. Thus, the ego’s job is
to find the middle ground. It helps satisfy the id’s desires in a rational way that will not lead us to feelings of
guilt. According to Freud, a person who has a strong ego, which can balance the demands of the id and the
superego, has a healthy personality. Freud maintained that imbalances in the system can lead to neurosis (a
tendency to experience negative emotions), anxiety disorders, or unhealthy behaviors. For example, a person
who is dominated by their id might be narcissistic and impulsive. A person with a dominant superego might be
controlled by feelings of guilt and deny themselves even socially acceptable pleasures; conversely, if the
superego is weak or absent, a person might become a psychopath. An overly dominant superego might be seen
in an over-controlled individual whose rational grasp on reality is so strong that they are unaware of their
emotional needs, or, in a neurotic who is overly defensive (overusing ego defense mechanisms).
Defense Mechanisms
Freud believed that feelings of anxiety result from the ego’s inability to mediate the conflict between the id and
superego. When this happens, Freud believed that the ego seeks to restore balance through various protective
measures known as defense mechanisms (Figure 11.7). When certain events, feelings, or yearnings cause an
individual anxiety, the individual wishes to reduce that anxiety. To do that, the individual’s unconscious mind
uses ego defense mechanisms, unconscious protective behaviors that aim to reduce anxiety. The ego, usually
364 11 • Personality
Access for free at openstax.org
conscious, resorts to unconscious strivings to protect the ego from being overwhelmed by anxiety. When we
use defense mechanisms, we are unaware that we are using them. Further, they operate in various ways that
distort reality. According to Freud, we all use ego defense mechanisms.
FIGURE 11.7 Defense mechanisms are unconscious protective behaviors that work to reduce anxiety.
While everyone uses defense mechanisms, Freud believed that overuse of them may be problematic. For
example, let’s say Joe is a high school football player. Deep down, Joe feels sexually attracted to males. His
conscious belief is that being gay is immoral and that if he were gay, his family would disown him and he would
be ostracized by his peers. Therefore, there is a conflict between his conscious beliefs (being gay is wrong and
11.2 • Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective 365
will result in being ostracized) and his unconscious urges (attraction to males). The idea that he might be gay
causes Joe to have feelings of anxiety. How can he decrease his anxiety? Joe may find himself acting very
“macho,” making gay jokes, and picking on a school peer who is gay. This way, Joe’s unconscious impulses are
further submerged.
There are several different types of defense mechanisms. For instance, in repression, anxiety-causing
memories from consciousness are blocked. As an analogy, let’s say your car is making a strange noise, but
because you do not have the money to get it fixed, you just turn up the radio so that you no longer hear the
strange noise. Eventually you forget about it. Similarly, in the human psyche, if a memory is too overwhelming
to deal with, it might be repressed and thus removed from conscious awareness (Freud, 1920). This repressed
memory might cause symptoms in other areas.
Another defense mechanism is reaction formation, in which someone expresses feelings, thoughts, and
behaviors opposite to their inclinations. In the above example, Joe made fun of a gay peer while himself being
attracted to males. In regression, an individual acts much younger than their age. For example, a four-year-old
child who resents the arrival of a newborn sibling may act like a baby and revert to drinking out of a bottle. In
projection, a person refuses to acknowledge her own unconscious feelings and instead sees those feelings in
someone else. Other defense mechanisms include rationalization, displacement, and sublimation.

Stages of Psychosexual Development
Freud believed that personality develops during early childhood: Childhood experiences shape our
personalities as well as our behavior as adults. He asserted that we develop via a series of stages during
childhood. Each of us must pass through these childhood stages, and if we do not have the proper nurturing
and parenting during a stage, we will be stuck, or fixated, in that stage, even as adults.
In each psychosexual stage of development, the child’s pleasure-seeking urges, coming from the id, are
focused on a different area of the body, called an erogenous zone. The stages are oral, anal, phallic, latency, and
genital (Table 11.1).
Freud’s psychosexual development theory is quite controversial. To understand the origins of the theory, it is
helpful to be familiar with the political, social, and cultural influences of Freud’s day in Vienna at the turn of
the 20th century. During this era, a climate of sexual repression, combined with limited understanding and
education surrounding human sexuality, heavily influenced Freud’s perspective. Given that sex was a taboo
topic, Freud assumed that negative emotional states (neuroses) stemmed from suppression of unconscious
sexual and aggressive urges. For Freud, his own recollections and interpretations of patients’ experiences and
dreams were sufficient proof that psychosexual stages were universal events in early childhood.
Freud’s Stages of Psychosexual Development
Stage Age (years) Erogenous Zone Major Conflict Adult Fixation Example
Oral 0–1 Mouth Weaning off breast or bottle Smoking, overeating
Anal 1–3 Anus Toilet training Neatness, messiness

TABLE 11.1
Oral Stage
In the oral stage (birth to 1 year), pleasure is focused on the mouth. Eating and the pleasure derived from
sucking (nipples, pacifiers, and thumbs) play a large part in a baby’s first year of life. At around 1 year of age,
babies are weaned from the bottle or breast, and this process can create conflict if not handled properly by
caregivers. According to Freud, an adult who smokes, drinks, overeats, or bites her nails is fixated in the oral
stage of her psychosexual development; she may have been weaned too early or too late, resulting in these
fixation tendencies, all of which seek to ease anxiety.
Anal Stage
After passing through the oral stage, children enter what Freud termed the anal stage (1–3 years). In this stage,
children experience pleasure in their bowel and bladder movements, so it makes sense that the conflict in this
stage is over toilet training. During this stage of development, children work to master control of themselves.
Freud suggested that success at the anal stage depended on how parents handled toilet training. Parents who
offer praise and rewards encourage positive results and can help children feel competent. Parents who are
harsh in toilet training can cause a child to become so fearful of soiling that they over-control and become
fixated at the anal stage, leading to the development of an anal-retentive personality. The anal-retentive
personality is stingy and stubborn, has a compulsive need for order and neatness, and might be considered a
perfectionist. If parents are too lenient in toilet training, the child may fail to develop sufficient self-control,
become fixated at this stage, and develop an anal-expulsive personality. The anal-expulsive personality is
messy, careless, disorganized, and prone to emotional outbursts.
Phallic Stage
Freud’s third stage of psychosexual development is the phallic stage (3–6 years), corresponding to the age
when children become aware of their bodies and recognize the differences between boys and girls. The
erogenous zone in this stage is the genitals. Conflict arises when the child feels a desire for the opposite-sex
parent, and jealousy and hatred toward the same-sex parent. For boys, this is called the Oedipus complex,
involving a boy's desire for his mother and his urge to replace his father who is seen as a rival for the mother’s
attention. At the same time, the boy is afraid his father will punish him for his feelings, so he experiences
castration anxiety. The Oedipus complex is successfully resolved when the boy begins to identify with his
father as an indirect way to have the mother. Failure to resolve the Oedipus complex may result in fixation and
development of a personality that might be described as vain and overly ambitious.
Girls experience a comparable conflict in the phallic stage—the Electra complex. The Electra complex, while
often attributed to Freud, was actually proposed by Freud’s protégé, Carl Jung (Jung & Kerenyi, 1963). A girl
desires the attention of her father and wishes to take her mother’s place. Jung also said that girls are angry
with the mother for not providing them with a penis—which he termed penis envy. While Freud initially
embraced the Electra complex as a parallel to the Oedipus complex, he later rejected it, yet it remains as a
cornerstone of Freudian theory, thanks in part to academics in the field (Freud, 1931/1968; Scott, 2005).
Latency Period
Following the phallic stage of psychosexual development is a period known as the latency period (6 years to
puberty). This period is not considered a stage, because sexual feelings are dormant as children focus on other
pursuits, such as school, friendships, hobbies, and sports. Children generally engage in activities with peers of
the same sex, which serves to consolidate a child’s gender-role identity.
11.2 • Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective 367
Genital Stage
The final stage is the genital stage (from puberty on). In this stage, there is a sexual reawakening as the
incestuous urges resurface. The young person redirects these urges to other, more socially acceptable partners
(who often resemble the other-sex parent). People in this stage have mature sexual interests, which for Freud
meant a strong desire for the opposite sex. Individuals who successfully completed the previous stages,
reaching the genital stage with no fixations, are said to be well-balanced, healthy adults.
While most of Freud’s ideas have not found support in modern research, and several contemporary
researchers rejected his premises, we cannot discount the contributions that Freud has made to the field of
psychology. It was Freud who pointed out that a large part of our mental life is influenced by the experiences of
early childhood and takes place outside of our conscious awareness; his theories paved the way for others.
While Freud's focus on biological drives led him to emphasize the impact of sociocultural factors on
personality development, his followers quickly realized that biology alone could not account for the diversity
they encountered as the practice of psychoanalysis spread during the time of the Nazi Holocaust. The
antisemitism which was prevalent during this period of time may have led mainstream psychoanalysts to
focus primarily on the universality of the psychological structures of the mind.
11.3 Neo-Freudians: Adler, Erikson, Jung, and Horney
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Discuss the concept of the inferiority complex
• Discuss the core differences between Erikson’s and Freud’s views on personality
• Discuss Jung’s ideas of the collective unconscious and archetypes
• Discuss the work of Karen Horney, including her revision of Freud’s “penis envy”
Freud attracted many followers who modified his ideas to create new theories about personality. These
theorists, referred to as neo-Freudians, generally agreed with Freud that childhood experiences matter, but
deemphasized sex, focusing more on the social environment and effects of culture on personality. Four notable
neo-Freudians include Alfred Adler, Erik Erikson, Carl Jung (pronounced “Yoong”), and Karen Horney
(pronounced “HORN-eye”).
Alfred Adler
Alfred Adler, a colleague of Freud’s and the first president of the Vienna Psychoanalytical Society (Freud’s
inner circle of colleagues), was the first major theorist to break away from Freud (Figure 11.8). He
subsequently founded a school of psychology called individual psychology, which focuses on our drive to
compensate for feelings of inferiority. Adler (1937, 1956) proposed the concept of the inferiority complex. An
inferiority complex refers to a person’s feelings that they lack worth and don’t measure up to the standards of
others or of society. Adler’s ideas about inferiority represent a major difference between his thinking and
Freud’s. Freud believed that we are motivated by sexual and aggressive urges, but Adler (1930, 1961) believed
that feelings of inferiority in childhood are what drive people to attempt to gain superiority and that this
striving is the force behind all of our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.

FIGURE 11.18 This image from the Thematic Apperception Tests (TAT) can be used in counseling settings.
A third projective test is the Rotter Incomplete Sentence Blank (RISB) developed by Julian Rotter in 1950
(recall his theory of locus of control, covered earlier in this chapter). There are three forms of this test for use
with different age groups: the school form, the college form, and the adult form. The tests include 40
incomplete sentences that people are asked to complete as quickly as possible (Figure 11.19). The average
time for completing the test is approximately 20 minutes, as responses are only 1–2 words in length. This test
is similar to a word association test, and like other types of projective tests, it is presumed that responses will
reveal desires, fears, and struggles. The RISB is used in screening college students for adjustment problems
and in career counseling (Holaday, Smith, & Sherry, 2010; Rotter & Rafferty 1950).
FIGURE 11.19 These incomplete sentences resemble the types of questions on the RISB. How would you complete
these sentences?
For many decades, these traditional projective tests have been used in cross-cultural personality assessments.
However, it was found that test bias limited their usefulness (Hoy-Watkins & Jenkins-Moore, 2008). It is
difficult to assess the personalities and lifestyles of members of widely divergent ethnic/cultural groups using
personality instruments based on data from a single culture or race (Hoy-Watkins & Jenkins-Moore, 2008). For
example, when the TAT was used with African-American test takers, the result was often shorter story length
and low levels of cultural identification (Duzant, 2005). Therefore, it was vital to develop other personality
assessments that explored factors such as race, language, and level of acculturation (Hoy-Watkins & Jenkins-
Moore, 2008). To address this need, Robert Williams developed the first culturally specific projective test
designed to reflect the everyday life experiences of African Americans (Hoy-Watkins & Jenkins-Moore, 2008).
The updated version of the instrument is the Contemporized-Themes Concerning Blacks Test (C-TCB)
(Williams, 1972). The C-TCB contains 20 color images that show scenes of African-American lifestyles. When
the C-TCB was compared with the TAT for African Americans, it was found that use of the C-TCB led to
increased story length, higher degrees of positive feelings, and stronger identification with the C-TCB (Hoy,
1997; Hoy-Watkins & Jenkins-Moore, 2008).
11.9 • Personality Assessment 389
The TEMAS Multicultural Thematic Apperception Test is another tool designed to be culturally relevant to
minority groups, especially Hispanic youths. TEMAS—standing for “Tell Me a Story” but also a play on the
Spanish word temas (themes)—uses images and storytelling cues that relate to minority culture (Constantino,
1982).

Summary
11.1 What Is Personality?
Personality has been studied for over 2,000 years, beginning with Hippocrates. More recent theories of
personality have been proposed, including Freud’s psychodynamic perspective, which holds that personality is
formed through early childhood experiences. Other perspectives then emerged in reaction to the
psychodynamic perspective, including the learning, humanistic, biological, trait, and cultural perspectives.
11.2 Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective
Sigmund Freud presented the first comprehensive theory of personality. He was also the first to recognize that
much of our mental life takes place outside of our conscious awareness. Freud also proposed three
components to our personality: the id, ego, and superego. The job of the ego is to balance the sexual and
aggressive drives of the id with the moral ideal of the superego. Freud also said that personality develops
through a series of psychosexual stages. In each stage, pleasure focuses on a specific erogenous zone. Failure
to resolve a stage can lead one to become fixated in that stage, leading to unhealthy personality traits.
Successful resolution of the stages leads to a healthy adult.
11.3 Neo-Freudians: Adler, Erikson, Jung, and Horney
The neo-Freudians were psychologists whose work followed from Freud’s. They generally agreed with Freud
that childhood experiences matter, but they decreased the emphasis on sex and focused more on the social

environment and effects of culture on personality. Some of the notable neo-Freudians are Alfred Adler, Carl
Jung, Erik Erikson, and Karen Horney. The neo-Freudian approaches have been criticized, because they tend
to be philosophical rather than based on sound scientific research. For example, Jung’s conclusions about the
existence of the collective unconscious are based on myths, legends, dreams, and art. In addition, as with
Freud’s psychoanalytic theory, the neo-Freudians based much of their theories of personality on information
from their patients.
11.4 Learning Approaches
Behavioral theorists view personality as significantly shaped and impacted by the reinforcements and
consequences outside of the organism. People behave in a consistent manner based on prior learning. B. F.
Skinner, a prominent behaviorist, said that we demonstrate consistent behavior patterns, because we have
developed certain response tendencies. Mischel focused on how personal goals play a role in the self-
regulation process. Albert Bandura said that one’s environment can determine behavior, but at the same time,
people can influence the environment with both their thoughts and behaviors, which is known as reciprocal
determinism. Bandura also emphasized how we learn from watching others. He felt that this type of learning
also plays a part in the development of our personality. Bandura discussed the concept of self-efficacy, which is
our level of confidence in our own abilities. Finally, Rotter proposed the concept of locus of control, which
refers to our beliefs about the power we have over our lives. He said that people fall along a continuum between
a purely internal and a purely external locus of control.
11.5 Humanistic Approaches
Humanistic psychologists Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers focused on the growth potential of healthy
individuals. They believed that people strive to become self-actualized. Both Rogers’s and Maslow’s theories
greatly contributed to our understanding of the self. They emphasized free will and self-determination, with
each individual desiring to become the best person they can become.
11.6 Biological Approaches
Some aspects of our personalities are largely controlled by genetics; however, environmental factors (such as
family interactions) and maturation can affect the ways in which children’s personalities are expressed.
11.7 Trait Theorists
Trait theorists attempt to explain our personality by identifying our stable characteristics and ways of
behaving. They have identified important dimensions of personality. The Five Factor Model is the most widely
accepted theory today. The five factors are openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and
neuroticism. These factors occur along a continuum.
11.8 Cultural Understandings of Personality
The culture in which you live is one of the most important environmental factors that shapes your personality.
Western ideas about personality may not be applicable to other cultures. In fact, there is evidence that the
strength of personality traits varies across cultures. Individualist cultures and collectivist cultures place
emphasis on different basic values. People who live in individualist cultures tend to believe that independence,
competition, and personal achievement are important. People who live in collectivist cultures value social
harmony, respectfulness, and group needs over individual needs. There are three approaches that can be used
to study personality in a cultural context: the cultural-comparative approach, the indigenous approach, and
the combined approach, which incorporates both elements of both views.
11.9 Personality Assessment
Personality tests are techniques designed to measure one’s personality. They are used to diagnose
psychological problems as well as to screen candidates for college and employment. There are two types of
personality tests: self-report inventories and projective tests. The MMPI is one of the most common self-report

About Psychology 2e
Psychology 2e is designed to meet scope and sequence requirements for the single-semester introduction to
psychology course. The book offers a comprehensive treatment of core concepts, grounded in both classic
Preface 1
studies and current and emerging research. The text also includes coverage of the DSM-5 in examinations of
psychological disorders. Psychology 2e incorporates discussions that reflect the diversity within the discipline,
as well as the diversity of cultures and communities across the globe.
Coverage and scope
The first edition of Psychology has been used by thousands of faculty and hundreds of thousands of students
since its publication in 2015. OpenStax mined our adopters’ extensive and helpful feedback to identify the
most significant revision needs while maintaining the organization that many instructors had incorporated
into their courses. Specific surveys, pre-revision reviews, and customization analysis, as well as analytical data
from OpenStax partners and online learning environments, all aided in planning the revision.
The result is a book that thoroughly treats psychology’s foundational concepts while adding current and
meaningful coverage in specific areas. Psychology 2e retains its manageable scope and contains ample
features to draw learners into the discipline.
Structurally, the textbook remains similar to the first edition, with no chapter reorganization and very targeted
changes at the section level.

Changes to the Second Edition
OpenStax only undertakes second editions when significant modifications to the text are necessary. In the case
of Psychology 2e, user feedback indicated that we needed to focus on a few key areas, which we have done in
the following ways.
Content revisions for clarity, accuracy, and currency
The revision plan varied by chapter based on need. Some chapters were significantly updated for conceptual
coverage, research-informed data, and clearer language. In other chapters, the revisions focused mostly on
currency of examples and updates to statistics.
Over 210 new research references have been added or updated in order to improve the scholarly
underpinnings of the material and broaden the perspective for students. Dozens of examples and feature
boxes have been changed or added to better explain concepts and/or increase relevance for students.
Research replication and validity
To engage students in stronger critical analysis and inform them about research reproducibility, substantial
coverage has been added to the research chapter and strategically throughout the textbook whenever key

studies are discussed. This material is presented in a balanced way and provides instructors with ample
opportunity to discuss the importance of replication in a manner that best suits their course.
Diversity, representation, and inclusion
With the help of researchers and teachers who focus on diversity- and identity-related issues, OpenStax has
engaged in detailed diversity reviews to identify opportunities to improve the textbook. Reviewers were asked
to follow a framework to evaluate the book’s terminology, research citations, key contributors to the field,
photos and illustrations, and related aspects, commenting on the representation and consideration of diverse
groups. Significant additions and revisions were made in this regard, and the review framework itself is
available among the OpenStax Psychology 2e instructor resources.
Art and illustrations
Under the guidance of the authors and expert scientific illustrators, especially those well versed in creating
accessible art, the OpenStax team made changes throughout the art program in Psychology 2e.
Accessibility improvements
As with all OpenStax books, the first edition of Psychology was created with a focus on accessibility. We have
emphasized and improved that approach in the second edition. Our goal is to ensure that all OpenStax
websites and the web view versions of our learning materials follow accessible web design best practices, so
that they will meet the W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 at Level AA and Section 508
of the Rehabilitation Act. The WCAG 2.0 guidelines explain ways to make web content more accessible for
people with disabilities and more user-friendly for everyone.
• To accommodate users of specific assistive technologies, all alternative text was reviewed and revised for
comprehensiveness and clarity.
• All illustrations were revised to improve the color contrast, which is important for some visually impaired
students.
• Overall, the OpenStax platform has been continually upgraded to improve accessibility.
To learn more about our commitment and progress, please view our accessibility statement
(https://openstax.org/accessibility-statement).
A transition guide will be available on openstax.org to highlight the specific chapter-level changes to the
second edition.
Pedagogical foundation
Psychology 2e engages students through inquiry, self-reflection, and investigation. Features in the second
edition have been carefully updated to remain topical and relevant while deepening students’ relationship to
the material. They include the following:
• Everyday Connection features tie psychological topics to everyday issues and behaviors that students
encounter in their lives and the world. Topics include the validity of scores on college entrance exams, the
opioid crisis, the impact of social status on stress and healthcare, and cognitive mapping.
• What Do You Think? features provide research-based information and ask students their views on
controversial issues. Topics include “Brain Dead and on Life Support,” “Violent Media and Aggression,”
and “Capital Punishment and Criminals with Intellectual Disabilities.”
• Dig Deeper features discuss one specific aspect of a topic in greater depth so students can dig more
deeply into the concept. Examples include discussions on the distinction between evolutionary
psychology and behavioral genetics, recent findings on neuroplasticity, the field of forensic psychology,
and a presentation of research on strategies for coping with prejudice and discrimination.
• Connect the Concepts features revisit a concept learned in another chapter, expanding upon it within a
different context. Features include “Emotional Expression and Emotional Regulation,” “Tweens, Teens,
Preface 3
and Social Norms,” and “Conditioning and OCD.”
Art, interactives, and assessments that engage
Our art program is designed to enhance students’ understanding of psychological concepts through simple,
effective graphs, diagrams, and photographs. Psychology 2e also incorporates links to relevant interactive
exercises and animations that help bring topics to life. Selected assessment items touch directly on students’
lives.
• Link to Learning features direct students to online interactive exercises and animations that add a fuller
context to core content and provide an opportunity for application.
• Personal Application Questions engage students in topics at a personal level to encourage reflection and
promote discussion.

samples, but for the purposes of this chapter, we will focus on random samples). A random sample is a subset
of a larger population in which every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected.
Random samples are preferred because if the sample is large enough we can be reasonably sure that the
participating individuals are representative of the larger population. This means that the percentages of
characteristics in the sample—sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic level, and any other characteristics that might
affect the results—are close to those percentages in the larger population.
In our example, let’s say we decide our population of interest is algebra students. But all algebra students is a
very large population, so we need to be more specific; instead we might say our population of interest is all
algebra students in a particular city. We should include students from various income brackets, family
situations, races, ethnicities, religions, and geographic areas of town. With this more manageable population,
we can work with the local schools in selecting a random sample of around 200 algebra students who we want
to participate in our experiment.
In summary, because we cannot test all of the algebra students in a city, we want to find a group of about 200
that reflects the composition of that city. With a representative group, we can generalize our findings to the
larger population without fear of our sample being biased in some way.
FIGURE 2.18 Researchers may work with (a) a large population or (b) a sample group that is a subset of the larger
population. (credit “crowd”: modification of work by James Cridland; credit “students”: modification of work by
Laurie Sullivan)
Now that we have a sample, the next step of the experimental process is to split the participants into
experimental and control groups through random assignment. With random assignment, all participants
have an equal chance of being assigned to either group. There is statistical software that will randomly assign
each of the algebra students in the sample to either the experimental or the control group.
Random assignment is critical for sound experimental design. With sufficiently large samples, random
assignment makes it unlikely that there are systematic differences between the groups. So, for instance, it
would be very unlikely that we would get one group composed entirely of males, a given ethnic identity, or a
given religious ideology. This is important because if the groups were systematically different before the
experiment began, we would not know the origin of any differences we find between the groups: Were the
differences preexisting, or were they caused by manipulation of the independent variable? Random
assignment allows us to assume that any differences observed between experimental and control groups
result from the manipulation of the independent variable.

Issues to Consider
While experiments allow scientists to make cause-and-effect claims, they are not without problems. True
2.3 • Analyzing Findings 55
experiments require the experimenter to manipulate an independent variable, and that can complicate many
questions that psychologists might want to address. For instance, imagine that you want to know what effect
sex (the independent variable) has on spatial memory (the dependent variable). Although you can certainly
look for differences between males and females on a task that taps into spatial memory, you cannot directly
control a person’s sex. We categorize this type of research approach as quasi-experimental and recognize that
we cannot make cause-and-effect claims in these circumstances.
Experimenters are also limited by ethical constraints. For instance, you would not be able to conduct an
experiment designed to determine if experiencing abuse as a child leads to lower levels of self-esteem among
adults. To conduct such an experiment, you would need to randomly assign some experimental participants to
a group that receives abuse, and that experiment would be unethical.
Interpreting Experimental Findings
Once data is collected from both the experimental and the control groups, a statistical analysis is conducted to
find out if there are meaningful differences between the two groups. A statistical analysis determines how
likely any difference found is due to chance (and thus not meaningful). For example, if an experiment is done
on the effectiveness of a nutritional supplement, and those taking a placebo pill (and not the supplement) have
the same result as those taking the supplement, then the experiment has shown that the nutritional
supplement is not effective. Generally, psychologists consider differences to be statistically significant if there
is less than a five percent chance of observing them if the groups did not actually differ from one another.
Stated another way, psychologists want to limit the chances of making “false positive” claims to five percent or
less.
The greatest strength of experiments is the ability to assert that any significant differences in the findings are
caused by the independent variable. This occurs because random selection, random assignment, and a design
that limits the effects of both experimenter bias and participant expectancy should create groups that are
similar in composition and treatment. Therefore, any difference between the groups is attributable to the
independent variable, and now we can finally make a causal statement. If we find that watching a violent
television program results in more violent behavior than watching a nonviolent program, we can safely say
that watching violent television programs causes an increase in the display of violent behavior.
Reporting Research
When psychologists complete a research project, they generally want to share their findings with other
scientists. The American Psychological Association (APA) publishes a manual detailing how to write a paper for
submission to scientific journals. Unlike an article that might be published in a magazine like Psychology
Today, which targets a general audience with an interest in psychology, scientific journals generally publish
peer-reviewed journal articles aimed at an audience of professionals and scholars who are actively involved
in research themselves.
LINK T O LEARNING
The Online Writing Lab (OWL) (http://openstax.org/l/owl) at Purdue University can walk you through the APA
writing guidelines.
A peer-reviewed journal article is read by several other scientists (generally anonymously) with expertise in
the subject matter. These peer reviewers provide feedback—to both the author and the journal
editor—regarding the quality of the draft. Peer reviewers look for a strong rationale for the research being
described, a clear description of how the research was conducted, and evidence that the research was
conducted in an ethical manner. They also look for flaws in the study's design, methods, and statistical
analyses. They check that the conclusions drawn by the authors seem reasonable given the observations made
during the research. Peer reviewers also comment on how valuable the research is in advancing the

discipline’s knowledge. This helps prevent unnecessary duplication of research findings in the scientific
literature and, to some extent, ensures that each research article provides new information. Ultimately, the
journal editor will compile all of the peer reviewer feedback and determine whether the article will be
published in its current state (a rare occurrence), published with revisions, or not accepted for publication.
Peer review provides some degree of quality control for psychological research. Poorly conceived or executed
studies can be weeded out, and even well-designed research can be improved by the revisions suggested. Peer
review also ensures that the research is described clearly enough to allow other scientists to replicate it,
meaning they can repeat the experiment using different samples to determine reliability. Sometimes
replications involve additional measures that expand on the original finding. In any case, each replication
serves to provide more evidence to support the original research findings. Successful replications of published
research make scientists more apt to adopt those findings, while repeated failures tend to cast doubt on the
legitimacy of the original article and lead scientists to look elsewhere. For example, it would be a major
advancement in the medical field if a published study indicated that taking a new drug helped individuals
achieve a healthy weight without changing their diet. But if other scientists could not replicate the results, the
original study’s claims would be questioned.
In recent years, there has been increasing concern about a “replication crisis” that has affected a number of
scientific fields, including psychology. Some of the most well-known studies and scientists have produced
research that has failed to be replicated by others (as discussed in Shrout & Rodgers, 2018). In fact, even a
famous Nobel Prize-winning scientist has recently retracted a published paper because she had difficulty
replicating her results (Nobel Prize-winning scientist Frances Arnold retracts paper, 2020 January 3). These
kinds of outcomes have prompted some scientists to begin to work together and more openly, and some would
argue that the current “crisis” is actually improving the ways in which science is conducted and in how its
results are shared with others (Aschwanden, 2018).
The Vaccine-Autism Myth and Retraction of Published Studies
Some scientists have claimed that routine childhood vaccines cause some children to develop autism, and, in
fact, several peer-reviewed publications published research making these claims. Since the initial reports, large-
scale epidemiological research has indicated that vaccinations are not responsible for causing autism and that it
is much safer to have your child vaccinated than not. Furthermore, several of the original studies making this
claim have since been retracted.
A published piece of work can be rescinded when data is called into question because of falsification, fabrication,
or serious research design problems. Once rescinded, the scientific community is informed that there are serious
problems with the original publication. Retractions can be initiated by the researcher who led the study, by
research collaborators, by the institution that employed the researcher, or by the editorial board of the journal in
which the article was originally published. In the vaccine-autism case, the retraction was made because of a
significant conflict of interest in which the leading researcher had a financial interest in establishing a link
between childhood vaccines and autism (Offit, 2008). Unfortunately, the initial studies received so much media
attention that many parents around the world became hesitant to have their children vaccinated (Figure 2.19).
Continued reliance on such debunked studies has significant consequences. For instance, between January and
October of 2019, there were 22 measles outbreaks across the United States and more than a thousand cases of
individuals contracting measles (Patel et al., 2019). This is likely due to the anti-vaccination movements that
have risen from the debunked research. For more information about how the vaccine/autism story unfolded, as
well as the repercussions of this story, take a look at Paul Offit’s book, Autism’s False Prophets: Bad Science,
Risky Medicine, and the Search for a Cure.

Reliability and Validity
Reliability and validity are two important considerations that must be made with any type of data collection.
Reliability refers to the ability to consistently produce a given result. In the context of psychological research,
this would mean that any instruments or tools used to collect data do so in consistent, reproducible ways.
There are a number of different types of reliability. Some of these include inter-rater reliability (the degree to
which two or more different observers agree on what has been observed), internal consistency (the degree to
which different items on a survey that measure the same thing correlate with one another), and test-retest
reliability (the degree to which the outcomes of a particular measure remain consistent over multiple
administrations).
Unfortunately, being consistent in measurement does not necessarily mean that you have measured
something correctly. To illustrate this concept, consider a kitchen scale that would be used to measure the
weight of cereal that you eat in the morning. If the scale is not properly calibrated, it may consistently under-
or overestimate the amount of cereal that’s being measured. While the scale is highly reliable in producing
consistent results (e.g., the same amount of cereal poured onto the scale produces the same reading each
time), those results are incorrect. This is where validity comes into play. Validity refers to the extent to which a
given instrument or tool accurately measures what it’s supposed to measure, and once again, there are a
number of ways in which validity can be expressed. Ecological validity (the degree to which research results
generalize to real-world applications), construct validity (the degree to which a given variable actually captures
or measures what it is intended to measure), and face validity (the degree to which a given variable seems valid
on the surface) are just a few types that researchers consider. While any valid measure is by necessity reliable,
the reverse is not necessarily true. Researchers strive to use instruments that are both highly reliable and
valid.

How Valid Are the SAT and ACT?
Standardized tests like the SAT and ACT are supposed to measure an individual’s aptitude for a college
education, but how reliable and valid are such tests? Research conducted by the College Board suggests that
scores on the SAT have high predictive validity for first-year college students’ GPA (Kobrin, Patterson, Shaw,
Mattern, & Barbuti, 2008). In this context, predictive validity refers to the test’s ability to effectively predict the
GPA of college freshmen. Given that many institutions of higher education require the SAT or ACT for admission,
this high degree of predictive validity might be comforting.
However, the emphasis placed on SAT or ACT scores in college admissions is changing based on a number of
factors. For one, some researchers assert that these tests are biased, and students from historically marginalized
populations are at a disadvantage that unfairly reduces the likelihood of being admitted into a college (Santelices
& Wilson, 2010). Additionally, some research has suggested that the predictive validity of these tests is grossly
exaggerated in how well they are able to predict the GPA of first-year college students. In fact, it has been
suggested that the SAT’s predictive validity may be overestimated by as much as 150% (Rothstein, 2004). Many
institutions of higher education are beginning to consider de-emphasizing the significance of SAT scores in
making admission decisions (Rimer, 2008).
Recent examples of high profile cheating scandals both domestically and abroad have only increased the scrutiny
being placed on these types of tests, and as of March 2019, more than 1000 institutions of higher education have
either relaxed or eliminated the requirements for SAT or ACT testing for admissions (Strauss, 2019, March 19).
2.4 Ethics
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Discuss how research involving human subjects is regulated
• Summarize the processes of informed consent and debriefing
• Explain how research involving animal subjects is regulated
Today, scientists agree that good research is ethical in nature and is guided by a basic respect for human
dignity and safety. However, as you will read in the feature box, this has not always been the case. Modern
researchers must demonstrate that the research they perform is ethically sound. This section presents how
ethical considerations affect the design and implementation of research conducted today.
Research Involving Human Participants
Any experiment involving the participation of human subjects is governed by extensive, strict guidelines
designed to ensure that the experiment does not result in harm. Any research institution that receives federal
support for research involving human participants must have access to an institutional review board (IRB).
The IRB is a committee of individuals often made up of members of the institution’s administration, scientists,
and community members (Figure 2.20). The purpose of the IRB is to review proposals for research that
involves human participants. The IRB reviews these proposals with the principles mentioned above in mind,
and generally, approval from the IRB is required in order for the experiment to proceed.

Summary
2.1 Why Is Research Important?
Scientists are engaged in explaining and understanding how the world around them works, and they are able
to do so by coming up with theories that generate hypotheses that are testable and falsifiable. Theories that
stand up to their tests are retained and refined, while those that do not are discarded or modified. In this way,
research enables scientists to separate fact from simple opinion. Having good information generated from
research aids in making wise decisions both in public policy and in our personal lives.
2.2 Approaches to Research
The clinical or case study involves studying just a few individuals for an extended period of time. While this
approach provides an incredible depth of information, the ability to generalize these observations to the larger
population is problematic. Naturalistic observation involves observing behavior in a natural setting and allows
64 2 • Summary
Access for free at openstax.org
for the collection of valid, true-to-life information from realistic situations. However, naturalistic observation
does not allow for much control and often requires quite a bit of time and money to perform. Researchers
strive to ensure that their tools for collecting data are both reliable (consistent and replicable) and valid
(accurate).
Surveys can be administered in a number of ways and make it possible to collect large amounts of data quickly.
However, the depth of information that can be collected through surveys is somewhat limited compared to a
clinical or case study.
Archival research involves studying existing data sets to answer research questions.
Longitudinal research has been incredibly helpful to researchers who need to collect data on how people
change over time. Cross-sectional research compares multiple segments of a population at a single time.
2.3 Analyzing Findings
A correlation is described with a correlation coefficient, r, which ranges from -1 to 1. The correlation
coefficient tells us about the nature (positive or negative) and the strength of the relationship between two or
more variables. Correlations do not tell us anything about causation—regardless of how strong the relationship
is between variables. In fact, the only way to demonstrate causation is by conducting an experiment. People
often make the mistake of claiming that correlations exist when they really do not.
Researchers can test cause-and-effect hypotheses by conducting experiments. Ideally, experimental
participants are randomly selected from the population of interest. Then, the participants are randomly
assigned to their respective groups. Sometimes, the researcher and the participants are blind to group
membership to prevent their expectations from influencing the results.
In ideal experimental design, the only difference between the experimental and control groups is whether
participants are exposed to the experimental manipulation. Each group goes through all phases of the
experiment, but each group will experience a different level of the independent variable: the experimental
group is exposed to the experimental manipulation, and the control group is not exposed to the experimental
manipulation. The researcher then measures the changes that are produced in the dependent variable in each
group. Once data is collected from both groups, it is analyzed statistically to determine if there are meaningful
differences between the groups.
Psychologists report their research findings in peer-reviewed journal articles. Research published in this
format is checked by several other psychologists who serve as a filter separating ideas that are supported by
evidence from ideas that are not. Replication has an important role in ensuring the legitimacy of published
research. In the long run, only those findings that are capable of being replicated consistently will achieve
consensus in the scientific community.
2.4 Ethics
Ethics in research is an evolving field, and some practices that were accepted or tolerated in the past would be
considered unethical today. Researchers are expected to adhere to basic ethical guidelines when conducting
experiments that involve human participants. Any experiment involving human participants must be
approved by an IRB. Participation in experiments is voluntary and requires informed consent of the
participants. If any deception is involved in the experiment, each participant must be fully debriefed upon the
conclusion of the study.
Animal research is also held to a high ethical standard. Researchers who use animals as experimental subjects
must design their projects so that pain and distress are minimized. Animal research requires the approval of
an IACUC, and all animal facilities are subject to regular inspections to ensure that animals are being treated
humanely.

40,"FIGURE 3.10 At resting potential, Na+ (blue pentagons) is more highly concentrated outside the cell in the
extracellular fluid (shown in blue), whereas K+ (purple squares) is more highly concentrated near the membrane in
the cytoplasm or intracellular fluid. Other molecules, such as chloride ions (yellow circles) and negatively charged
proteins (brown squares), help contribute to a positive net charge in the extracellular fluid and a negative net charge
in the intracellular fluid.
From this resting potential state, the neuron receives a signal and its state changes abruptly (Figure 3.11).
When a neuron receives signals at the dendrites—due to neurotransmitters from an adjacent neuron binding
to its receptors—small pores, or gates, open on the neuronal membrane, allowing Na+ ions, propelled by both
charge and concentration differences, to move into the cell. With this influx of positive ions, the internal
charge of the cell becomes more positive. If that charge reaches a certain level, called the threshold of
excitation, the neuron becomes active and the action potential begins.
Many additional pores open, causing a massive influx of Na+ ions and a huge positive spike in the membrane
potential, the peak action potential. At the peak of the spike, the sodium gates close and the potassium gates
open. As positively charged potassium ions leave, the cell quickly begins repolarization. At first, it
hyperpolarizes, becoming slightly more negative than the resting potential, and then it levels off, returning to
the resting potential.
FIGURE 3.11 During the action potential, the electrical charge across the membrane changes dramatically.
This positive spike constitutes the action potential: the electrical signal that typically moves from the cell body
down the axon to the axon terminals. The electrical signal moves down the axon with the impulses jumping in
a leapfrog fashion between the Nodes of Ranvier. The Nodes of Ranvier are natural gaps in the myelin sheath.
At each point, some of the sodium ions that enter the cell diffuse to the next section of the axon, raising the
charge past the threshold of excitation and triggering a new influx of sodium ions. The action potential moves
3.2 • Cells of the Nervous System 81
all the way down the axon in this fashion until reaching the terminal buttons.
The action potential is an all-or-none phenomenon. In simple terms, this means that an incoming signal from
another neuron is either sufficient or insufficient to reach the threshold of excitation. There is no in-between,
and there is no turning off an action potential once it starts. Think of it like sending an email or a text message.
You can think about sending it all you want, but the message is not sent until you hit the send button.
Furthermore, once you send the message, there is no stopping it.
Because it is all or none, the action potential is recreated, or propagated, at its full strength at every point along
the axon. Much like the lit fuse of a firecracker, it does not fade away as it travels down the axon. It is this all-or-
none property that explains the fact that your brain perceives an injury to a distant body part like your toe as
equally painful as one to your nose.
As noted earlier, when the action potential arrives at the terminal button, the synaptic vesicles release their
neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitters travel across the synapse and bind to
receptors on the dendrites of the adjacent neuron, and the process repeats itself in the new neuron (assuming
the signal is sufficiently strong to trigger an action potential). Once the signal is delivered, excess
neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft drift away, are broken down into inactive fragments, or are reabsorbed
in a process known as reuptake. Reuptake involves the neurotransmitter being pumped back into the neuron
that released it, in order to clear the synapse (Figure 3.12). Clearing the synapse serves both to provide a clear
“on” and “off” state between signals and to regulate the production of neurotransmitter (full synaptic vesicles
provide signals that no additional neurotransmitters need to be produced).
FIGURE 3.12 Reuptake involves moving a neurotransmitter from the synapse back into the axon terminal from
which it was released.
Neuronal communication is often referred to as an electrochemical event. The movement of the action
potential down the length of the axon is an electrical event, and movement of the neurotransmitter across the
synaptic space represents the chemical portion of the process. However, there are some specialized
connections between neurons that are entirely electrical. In such cases, the neurons are said to communicate
via an electrical synapse. In these cases, two neurons physically connect to one another via gap junctions,
which allows the current from one cell to pass into the next. There are far fewer electrical synapses in the
brain, but those that do exist are much faster than the chemical synapses that have been described above
(Connors & Long, 2004).

Neurotransmitters and Drugs
There are several different types of neurotransmitters released by different neurons, and we can speak in
broad terms about the kinds of functions associated with different neurotransmitters (Table 3.1). Much of what
psychologists know about the functions of neurotransmitters comes from research on the effects of drugs in
psychological disorders. Psychologists who take a biological perspective and focus on the physiological
causes of behavior assert that psychological disorders like depression and schizophrenia are associated with
imbalances in one or more neurotransmitter systems. In this perspective, psychotropic medications can help
improve the symptoms associated with these disorders. Psychotropic medications are drugs that treat
psychiatric symptoms by restoring neurotransmitter balance.
Major Neurotransmitters and How They Affect Behavior
Neurotransmitter Involved in Potential Effect on Behavior
Acetylcholine Muscle action, memory Increased arousal, enhanced cognition
Beta-endorphin Pain, pleasure Decreased anxiety, decreased tension
Dopamine Mood, sleep, learning Increased pleasure, suppressed appetite
Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) Brain function, sleep Decreased anxiety, decreased tension
Glutamate Memory, learning Increased learning, enhanced memory
Norepinephrine Heart, intestines, alertness Increased arousal, suppressed appetite
Serotonin Mood, sleep Modulated mood, suppressed appetite
TABLE 3.1
Psychoactive drugs can act as agonists or antagonists for a given neurotransmitter system. Agonists are
chemicals that mimic a neurotransmitter at the receptor site. An antagonist, on the other hand, blocks or
impedes the normal activity of a neurotransmitter at the receptor. Agonists and antagonists represent drugs
that are prescribed to correct the specific neurotransmitter imbalances underlying a person’s condition. For
example, Parkinson's disease, a progressive nervous system disorder, is associated with low levels of
dopamine. Therefore, a common treatment strategy for Parkinson's disease involves using dopamine agonists,
which mimic the effects of dopamine by binding to dopamine receptors.
Certain symptoms of schizophrenia are associated with overactive dopamine neurotransmission. The
antipsychotics used to treat these symptoms are antagonists for dopamine—they block dopamine’s effects by
binding its receptors without activating them. Thus, they prevent dopamine released by one neuron from
signaling information to adjacent neurons.
In contrast to agonists and antagonists, which both operate by binding to receptor sites, reuptake inhibitors
prevent unused neurotransmitters from being transported back to the neuron. This allows neurotransmitters
to remain active in the synaptic cleft for longer durations, increasing their effectiveness. Depression, which
has been consistently linked with reduced serotonin levels, is commonly treated with selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). By preventing reuptake, SSRIs strengthen the effect of serotonin, giving it more
time to interact with serotonin receptors on dendrites. Common SSRIs on the market today include Prozac,
Paxil, and Zoloft. The drug LSD is structurally very similar to serotonin, and it affects the same neurons and
receptors as serotonin. Psychotropic drugs are not instant solutions for people suffering from psychological
disorders. Often, an individual must take a drug for several weeks before seeing improvement, and many
3.2 • Cells of the Nervous System 83
psychoactive drugs have significant negative side effects. Furthermore, individuals vary dramatically in how
they respond to the drugs. To improve chances for success, it is not uncommon for people receiving
pharmacotherapy to undergo psychological and/or behavioral therapies as well. Some research suggests that
combining drug therapy with other forms of therapy tends to be more effective than any one treatment alone
(for one such example, see March et al., 2007).
3.3 Parts of the Nervous System
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the difference between the central and peripheral nervous systems
• Explain the difference between the somatic and autonomic nervous systems
• Differentiate between the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system
The nervous system can be divided into two major subdivisions: the central nervous system (CNS) and the
peripheral nervous system (PNS), shown in Figure 3.13. The CNS is comprised of the brain and spinal cord;
the PNS connects the CNS to the rest of the body. In this section, we focus on the peripheral nervous system;
later, we look at the brain and spinal cord.
FIGURE 3.13 The nervous system is divided into two major parts: (a) the Central Nervous System and (b) the
Peripheral Nervous System.
Peripheral Nervous System
The peripheral nervous system is made up of thick bundles of axons, called nerves, carrying messages back
and forth between the CNS and the muscles, organs, and senses in the periphery of the body (i.e., everything
outside the CNS). The PNS has two major subdivisions: the somatic nervous system and the autonomic
84 3 • Biopsychology

nervous system.
The somatic nervous system is associated with activities traditionally thought of as conscious or voluntary. It
is involved in the relay of sensory and motor information to and from the CNS; therefore, it consists of motor
neurons and sensory neurons. Motor neurons, carrying instructions from the CNS to the muscles, are efferent
fibers (efferent means “moving away from”). Sensory neurons, carrying sensory information to the CNS, are
afferent fibers (afferent means “moving toward”). A helpful way to remember this is that efferent = exit and
afferent = arrive. Each nerve is basically a bundle of neurons forming a two-way superhighway, containing
thousands of axons, both efferent and afferent.
The autonomic nervous system controls our internal organs and glands and is generally considered to be
outside the realm of voluntary control. It can be further subdivided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic
divisions (Figure 3.14). The sympathetic nervous system is involved in preparing the body for stress-related
activities; the parasympathetic nervous system is associated with returning the body to routine, day-to-day
operations. The two systems have complementary functions, operating in tandem to maintain the body’s
homeostasis. Homeostasis is a state of equilibrium, or balance, in which biological conditions (such as body
temperature) are maintained at optimal levels.
FIGURE 3.14 The sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system have the opposite
effects on various systems.
The sympathetic nervous system is activated when we are faced with stressful or high-arousal situations. The
activity of this system was adaptive for our ancestors, increasing their chances of survival. Imagine, for
example, that one of our early ancestors, out hunting small game, suddenly disturbs a large bear with her cubs.
At that moment, the hunter's body undergoes a series of changes—a direct function of sympathetic
activation—preparing them to face the threat. The pupils dilate, the heart rate and blood pressure increase, the
bladder relaxes, and the liver releases glucose; adrenaline surges into the bloodstream. This constellation of

16.5 The Sociocultural Model and Therapy Utilization
What comes to mind when you think about therapy for mental health issues? You might
picture someone lying on a couch talking about his childhood while the therapist sits and takes notes, à la
Sigmund Freud. But can you envision a therapy session in which someone is wearing virtual reality headgear
to conquer a fear of snakes?
In this chapter, you will see that approaches to therapy include both psychological and biological interventions,
all with the goal of alleviating distress. Because psychological problems can originate from various
sources—biology, genetics, childhood experiences, conditioning, and sociocultural influences—psychologists
have developed many different therapeutic techniques and approaches. The Ocean Therapy program shown in
Figure 16.1 uses multiple approaches to support the mental health of veterans in the group.
There are many misconceptions and assumptions about therapy and treatment. In the same way that mental

health and psychological disorders are often misunderstood and may be discounted, seeking help for
problems can be a difficult and scary time for people. There is no one method that works for everyone, and
those seeking help are displaying strength and courage in their decision to address a highly stigmatized and
challenging issue. The goal of treatment is not to change whom a person is, but to address symptoms and/or
underlying conditions.
16.1 Mental Health Treatment: Past and Present
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Explain how people with psychological disorders have been treated throughout the ages
• Discuss deinstitutionalization
• Discuss the ways in which mental health services are delivered today
• Distinguish between voluntary and involuntary treatment
Before we explore the various approaches to therapy used today, let’s begin our study of therapy by looking at
how many people experience mental illness and how many receive treatment. According to the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services (2017), 18.9% of U.S. adults experienced mental illness in 2017.
For teens (ages 13–18), the rate is similar to that of adults, and for children ages 8–15, current estimates
suggest that approximately 13% experience mental illness in a given year (National Institute of Mental Health
[NIMH], 2017).
With many different treatment options available, approximately how many people receive mental health
treatment per year? According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA),
in 2017, 14.8% of adults received treatment for a mental health issue (NIMH, 2017). These percentages, shown
in Figure 16.2, reflect the number of adults who received care in inpatient and outpatient settings and/or used
prescription medication for psychological disorders.
FIGURE 16.2 The percentage of adults who received mental health treatment in 2004–2008 is shown. Adults
seeking treatment increased slightly from 2004 to 2008.
Children and adolescents also receive mental health services. The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) found that approximately half
(50.6%) of children with mental disorders had received treatment for their disorder within the past year
(NIMH, n.d.). However, there were some differences between treatment rates by category of disorder (Figure
16.3). For example, children with anxiety disorders were least likely to have received treatment in the past
year, while children with ADHD or a conduct disorder were more likely to receive treatment. Can you think of
some possible reasons for these differences in receiving treatment?

FIGURE 16.3 About one-third to one-half of U.S. adolescents (ages 8–15) with mental disorders receive treatment,
with behavior-related disorders more likely to be treated.
Considering the many forms of treatment for mental health disorders available today, how did these forms of
treatment emerge? Let’s take a look at the history of mental health treatment from the past (with some
questionable approaches in light of modern understanding of mental illness) to where we are today.
Treatment in the Past
For much of history, people with mental illness have been treated very poorly. It was believed that mental
illness was caused by demonic possession, witchcraft, or an angry god (Szasz, 1960). For example, in medieval
times, abnormal behaviors were viewed as a sign that a person was possessed by demons. If someone was
considered to be possessed, there were several forms of treatment to release spirits from the individual. The
most common treatment was exorcism, often conducted by priests or other religious figures: Incantations and
prayers were said over the person’s body, and they may have been given some medicinal drinks. Another form
of treatment for extreme cases of mental illness was trephining: A small hole was made in the afflicted
individual’s skull to release spirits from the body. Most people treated in this manner died. In addition to
exorcism and trephining, other practices involved execution or imprisonment of people with psychological
disorders. Still others were left to be homeless beggars. Generally speaking, most people who exhibited strange
behaviors were greatly misunderstood and treated cruelly. The prevailing theory of psychopathology in earlier
history was the idea that mental illness was the result of demonic possession by either an evil spirit or an evil
god because early beliefs incorrectly attributed all unexplainable phenomena to deities deemed either good or
evil.
From the late 1400s to the late 1600s, a common belief perpetuated by some religious organizations was that
some people made pacts with the devil and committed horrible acts, such as eating babies (Blumberg, 2007).
These people were considered to be witches and were tried and condemned by courts—they were often burned
at the stake. Worldwide, it is estimated that tens of thousands of mentally ill people were killed after being
accused of being witches or under the influence of witchcraft (Hemphill, 1966)
By the 18th century, people who were considered odd and unusual were placed in asylums (Figure 16.4).
Asylums were the first institutions created for the specific purpose of housing people with psychological
disorders, but the focus was ostracizing them from society rather than treating their disorders. Often these
people were kept in windowless dungeons, beaten, chained to their beds, and had little to no contact with
caregivers.

","Answer VERY concisely from the provided context only. Your answer length: less or equal 150 tokens. Plain text, no Markdown. Answer only, no other questions. Context: FIGURE 3.10 At resting potential, Na+ (blue pentagons) is more highly concentrated outside the cell in the extracellular fluid (shown in blue), whereas K+ (purple squares) is more highly concentrated near the membrane in the cytoplasm or intracellular fluid. Other molecules, such as chloride ions (yellow circles) and negatively charged proteins (brown squares), help contribute to a positive net charge in the extracellular fluid and a negative net charge in the intracellular fluid. From this resting potential state, the neuron receives a signal and its state changes abruptly (Figure 3.11). When a neuron receives signals at the dendrites—due to neurotransmitters from an adjacent neuron binding to its receptors—small pores, or gates, open on the neuronal membrane, allowing Na+ ions, propelled by both charge and concentration differences, to move into the cell. With this influx of positive ions, the internal charge of the cell becomes more positive. If that charge reaches a certain level, called the threshold of excitation, the neuron becomes active and the action potential begins. Many additional pores open, causing a massive influx of Na+ ions and a huge positive spike in the membrane potential, the peak action potential. At the peak of the spike, the sodium gates close and the potassium gates open. As positively charged potassium ions leave, the cell quickly begins repolarization. At first, it hyperpolarizes, becoming slightly more negative than the resting potential, and then it levels off, returning to the resting potential. FIGURE 3.11 During the action potential, the electrical charge across the membrane changes dramatically. This positive spike constitutes the action potential: the electrical signal that typically moves from the cell body down the axon to the axon terminals. The electrical signal moves down the axon with the impulses jumping in a leapfrog fashion between the Nodes of Ranvier. The Nodes of Ranvier are natural gaps in the myelin sheath. At each point, some of the sodium ions that enter the cell diffuse to the next section of the axon, raising the charge past the threshold of excitation and triggering a new influx of sodium ions. The action potential moves 3.2 • Cells of the Central Nervous System The central nervous system (CNS), which includes the brain and spinal cord, is the body’s control center. It receives and processes information from sensory organs and sends signals to muscles and glands, as well as executes commands from higher brain centers. The CNS is divided into two main parts: The brain, which contains the cerebrum, cerebellum and brainstem, and is responsible for controlling voluntary movements, including breathing, heart rate, blood pressure, eye movement, swallowing, speaking, etc., and is also involved in learning and memory; and The Spinal Cord, which is made up of four pairs of spinal nerves, each of which controls a specific muscle or group of muscles. In the CNS, there are two types of neurons: Sensory neurons and Motor neurons. Sensory Neurons A sensory neuron is a nerve cell that receives information about the environment and transmits it to other nerve cells. These cells are called sensory neurons because they receive sensory information (such as light, sound, smell, taste, temperature, pain, touch, vibration, pressure) from their surroundings and transmit that information along their axons (the long, thin extensions of nerve cells that carry electrical and chemical signals from one neuron to another) to their target cells (neurons that receive the information and transmit it). The target cell is called a motor neuron, because it receives the signal from a sensory neuron and uses that signal to control the movement of a muscle, gland, organ or organ system. Motor Neuron Motor neurons are also called motor neurons, but they are different from other neurons in that they do not receive sensory signals. Instead, they transmit signals that tell the muscle to contract or relax. They are also called effector neurons. This is because the signals they send are used to cause the contraction or relaxation of certain muscles. For example, when a person touches a hot stove, his or her muscles contract and the blood flow to those muscles increases. When the person leaves the stove and moves away from it, the muscle relaxes. In this way, afferent signals are converted into motor signals and sent to motor Neurons are the basic building blocks of all nervous systems. There are about 86 billion neurons (about 200 million per person) in a human brain. Each of these neurons is connected to at least one other neuron through a synapse.

different from range of reaction, because here the genotype is not fixed and limited.

Genes affect more than our physical characteristics. Indeed, scientists have found genetic linkages to a
number of behavioral characteristics, ranging from basic personality traits to sexual orientation to spirituality
(for examples, see Mustanski et al., 2005; Comings, Gonzales, Saucier, Johnson, & MacMurray, 2000). Genes are
also associated with temperament and a number of psychological disorders, such as depression and
schizophrenia. So while it is true that genes provide the biological blueprints for our cells, tissues, organs, and
body, they also have a significant impact on our experiences and our behaviors.
Let’s look at the following findings regarding schizophrenia in light of our three views of gene-environment
interactions. Which view do you think best explains this evidence?
In a 2004 study by Tienari and colleagues, adoptees whose biological mothers had schizophrenia and who had
been raised in a disturbed family environment were much more likely to develop schizophrenia or another
psychotic disorder than were any of the other groups in the study:
• Of adoptees whose biological mothers had schizophrenia (high genetic risk) and who were raised in
disturbed family environments, 36.8% were likely to develop schizophrenia.
• Of adoptees whose biological mothers had schizophrenia (high genetic risk) and who were raised in
healthy family environments, 5.8% were likely to develop schizophrenia.
• Of adoptees with a low genetic risk (whose mothers did not have schizophrenia) and who were raised in
disturbed family environments, 5.3% were likely to develop schizophrenia.
• Of adoptees with a low genetic risk (whose mothers did not have schizophrenia) and who were raised in
healthy family environments, 4.8% were likely to develop schizophrenia.
The study shows that adoptees with high genetic risk were most likely to develop schizophrenia if they were
raised in disturbed home environments. This research lends credibility to the notion that both genetic
vulnerability and environmental stress are necessary for schizophrenia to develop, and that genes alone do not
tell the full tale.
3.2 Cells of the Nervous System
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Identify the basic parts of a neuron
• Describe how neurons communicate with each other
• Explain how drugs act as agonists or antagonists for a given neurotransmitter system
Psychologists striving to understand the human mind may study the nervous system. Learning how the body's
cells and organs function can help us understand the biological basis of human psychology. The nervous
system is composed of two basic cell types: glial cells (also known as glia) and neurons. Glial cells are
traditionally thought to play a supportive role to neurons, both physically and metabolically. Glial cells provide
scaffolding on which the nervous system is built, help neurons line up closely with each other to allow
neuronal communication, provide insulation to neurons, transport nutrients and waste products, and mediate
immune responses. For years, researchers believed that there were many more glial cells than neurons;
however, more recent work from Suzanna Herculano-Houzel's laboratory has called this long-standing
assumption into question and has provided important evidence that there may be a nearly 1:1 ratio of glia cells
to neurons. This is important because it suggests that human brains are more similar to other primate brains
than previously thought (Azevedo et al, 2009; Herculano-Houzel, 2012; Herculano-Houzel, 2009). Neurons, on
78 3 • Biopsychology
Access for free at openstax.org
the other hand, serve as interconnected information processors that are essential for all of the tasks of the
nervous system. This section briefly describes the structure and function of neurons.
Neuron Structure
Neurons are the central building blocks of the nervous system, 100 billion strong at birth. Like all cells,
neurons consist of several different parts, each serving a specialized function (Figure 3.8). A neuron’s outer
surface is made up of a semipermeable membrane. This membrane allows smaller molecules and molecules
without an electrical charge to pass through it, while stopping larger or highly charged molecules.
FIGURE 3.8 This illustration shows a prototypical neuron, which is being myelinated by a glial cell.
The nucleus of the neuron is located in the soma, or cell body. The soma has branching extensions known as
dendrites. The neuron is a small information processor, and dendrites serve as input sites where signals are
received from other neurons. These signals are transmitted electrically across the soma and down a major
extension from the soma known as the axon, which ends at multiple terminal buttons. The terminal buttons
contain synaptic vesicles that house neurotransmitters, the chemical messengers of the nervous system.
Axons range in length from a fraction of an inch to several feet. In some axons, glial cells form a fatty substance
known as the myelin sheath, which coats the axon and acts as an insulator, increasing the speed at which the
signal travels. The myelin sheath is not continuous and there are small gaps that occur down the length of the
axon. These gaps in the myelin sheath are known as the Nodes of Ranvier. The myelin sheath is crucial for the
normal operation of the neurons within the nervous system: the loss of the insulation it provides can be
detrimental to normal function. To understand how this works, let’s consider an example. PKU, a genetic
disorder discussed earlier, causes a reduction in myelin and abnormalities in white matter cortical and
subcortical structures. The disorder is associated with a variety of issues including severe cognitive deficits,
exaggerated reflexes, and seizures (Anderson & Leuzzi, 2010; Huttenlocher, 2000). Another disorder, multiple
sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disorder, involves a large-scale loss of the myelin sheath on axons throughout
the nervous system. The resulting interference in the electrical signal prevents the quick transmittal of
information by neurons and can lead to a number of symptoms, such as dizziness, fatigue, loss of motor
control, and sexual dysfunction. While some treatments may help to modify the course of the disease and
manage certain symptoms, there is currently no known cure for multiple sclerosis.
In healthy individuals, the neuronal signal moves rapidly down the axon to the terminal buttons, where
synaptic vesicles release neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft (Figure 3.9). The synaptic cleft is a very
small space between two neurons and is an important site where communication between neurons occurs.
Once neurotransmitters are released into the synaptic cleft, they travel across it and bind with corresponding
receptors on the dendrite of an adjacent neuron. Receptors, proteins on the cell surface where
neurotransmitters attach, vary in shape, with different shapes “matching” different neurotransmitters.
How does a neurotransmitter “know” which receptor to bind to? The neurotransmitter and the receptor have
3.2 • Cells of the Nervous System 79
what is referred to as a lock-and-key relationship—specific neurotransmitters fit specific receptors similar to
how a key fits a lock. The neurotransmitter binds to any receptor that it fits.
FIGURE 3.9 (a) The synaptic cleft is the space between the terminal button of one neuron and the dendrite of
another neuron. (b) In this pseudo-colored image from a scanning electron microscope, a terminal button (green)
has been opened to reveal the synaptic vesicles (orange and blue) inside. Each vesicle contains about 10,000
neurotransmitter molecules. (credit b: modification of work by Tina Carvalho, NIH-NIGMS; scale-bar data from Matt
Russell)
Neuronal Communication
Now that we have learned about the basic structures of the neuron and the role that these structures play in
neuronal communication, let’s take a closer look at the signal itself—how it moves through the neuron and then
jumps to the next neuron, where the process is repeated.
We begin at the neuronal membrane. The neuron exists in a fluid environment—it is surrounded by
extracellular fluid and contains intracellular fluid (i.e., cytoplasm). The neuronal membrane keeps these two
fluids separate—a critical role because the electrical signal that passes through the neuron depends on the
intra- and extracellular fluids being electrically different. This difference in charge across the membrane,
called the membrane potential, provides energy for the signal.
The electrical charge of the fluids is caused by charged molecules (ions) dissolved in the fluid. The
semipermeable nature of the neuronal membrane somewhat restricts the movement of these charged
molecules, and, as a result, some of the charged particles tend to become more concentrated either inside or
outside the cell.
Between signals, the neuron membrane’s potential is held in a state of readiness, called the resting potential.
Like a rubber band stretched out and waiting to spring into action, ions line up on either side of the cell
membrane, ready to rush across the membrane when the neuron goes active and the membrane opens its
gates. Ions in high-concentration areas are ready to move to low-concentration areas, and positive ions are
ready to move to areas with a negative charge.
In the resting state, sodium (Na+) is at higher concentrations outside the cell, so it will tend to move into the
cell. Potassium (K+), on the other hand, is more concentrated inside the cell, and will tend to move out of the
cell (Figure 3.10). In addition, the inside of the cell is slightly negatively charged compared to the outside, due
to the activity of the sodium-potassium pump. This pump actively transports three sodium ions out of the cell
for every two potassium ions in, creating a net negative charge inside the cell. This provides an additional
force on sodium, causing it to move into the cell.

FIGURE 3.10 At resting potential, Na+ (blue pentagons) is more highly concentrated outside the cell in the
extracellular fluid (shown in blue), whereas K+ (purple squares) is more highly concentrated near the membrane in
the cytoplasm or intracellular fluid. Other molecules, such as chloride ions (yellow circles) and negatively charged
proteins (brown squares), help contribute to a positive net charge in the extracellular fluid and a negative net charge
in the intracellular fluid.
From this resting potential state, the neuron receives a signal and its state changes abruptly (Figure 3.11).
When a neuron receives signals at the dendrites—due to neurotransmitters from an adjacent neuron binding
to its receptors—small pores, or gates, open on the neuronal membrane, allowing Na+ ions, propelled by both
charge and concentration differences, to move into the cell. With this influx of positive ions, the internal
charge of the cell becomes more positive. If that charge reaches a certain level, called the threshold of
excitation, the neuron becomes active and the action potential begins.
Many additional pores open, causing a massive influx of Na+ ions and a huge positive spike in the membrane
potential, the peak action potential. At the peak of the spike, the sodium gates close and the potassium gates
open. As positively charged potassium ions leave, the cell quickly begins repolarization. At first, it
hyperpolarizes, becoming slightly more negative than the resting potential, and then it levels off, returning to
the resting potential.
FIGURE 3.11 During the action potential, the electrical charge across the membrane changes dramatically.
This positive spike constitutes the action potential: the electrical signal that typically moves from the cell body
down the axon to the axon terminals. The electrical signal moves down the axon with the impulses jumping in
a leapfrog fashion between the Nodes of Ranvier. The Nodes of Ranvier are natural gaps in the myelin sheath.
At each point, some of the sodium ions that enter the cell diffuse to the next section of the axon, raising the
charge past the threshold of excitation and triggering a new influx of sodium ions. The action potential moves
3.2 • Cells of the Nervous System 81
all the way down the axon in this fashion until reaching the terminal buttons.
The action potential is an all-or-none phenomenon. In simple terms, this means that an incoming signal from
another neuron is either sufficient or insufficient to reach the threshold of excitation. There is no in-between,
and there is no turning off an action potential once it starts. Think of it like sending an email or a text message.
You can think about sending it all you want, but the message is not sent until you hit the send button.
Furthermore, once you send the message, there is no stopping it.
Because it is all or none, the action potential is recreated, or propagated, at its full strength at every point along
the axon. Much like the lit fuse of a firecracker, it does not fade away as it travels down the axon. It is this all-or-
none property that explains the fact that your brain perceives an injury to a distant body part like your toe as
equally painful as one to your nose.
As noted earlier, when the action potential arrives at the terminal button, the synaptic vesicles release their
neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitters travel across the synapse and bind to
receptors on the dendrites of the adjacent neuron, and the process repeats itself in the new neuron (assuming
the signal is sufficiently strong to trigger an action potential). Once the signal is delivered, excess
neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft drift away, are broken down into inactive fragments, or are reabsorbed
in a process known as reuptake. Reuptake involves the neurotransmitter being pumped back into the neuron
that released it, in order to clear the synapse (Figure 3.12). Clearing the synapse serves both to provide a clear
“on” and “off” state between signals and to regulate the production of neurotransmitter (full synaptic vesicles
provide signals that no additional neurotransmitters need to be produced).
FIGURE 3.12 Reuptake involves moving a neurotransmitter from the synapse back into the axon terminal from
which it was released.
Neuronal communication is often referred to as an electrochemical event. The movement of the action
potential down the length of the axon is an electrical event, and movement of the neurotransmitter across the
synaptic space represents the chemical portion of the process. However, there are some specialized
connections between neurons that are entirely electrical. In such cases, the neurons are said to communicate
via an electrical synapse. In these cases, two neurons physically connect to one another via gap junctions,
which allows the current from one cell to pass into the next. There are far fewer electrical synapses in the
brain, but those that do exist are much faster than the chemical synapses that have been described above
(Connors & Long, 2004).

Neurotransmitters and Drugs
There are several different types of neurotransmitters released by different neurons, and we can speak in
broad terms about the kinds of functions associated with different neurotransmitters (Table 3.1). Much of what
psychologists know about the functions of neurotransmitters comes from research on the effects of drugs in
psychological disorders. Psychologists who take a biological perspective and focus on the physiological
causes of behavior assert that psychological disorders like depression and schizophrenia are associated with
imbalances in one or more neurotransmitter systems. In this perspective, psychotropic medications can help
improve the symptoms associated with these disorders. Psychotropic medications are drugs that treat
psychiatric symptoms by restoring neurotransmitter balance.
Major Neurotransmitters and How They Affect Behavior
Neurotransmitter Involved in Potential Effect on Behavior
Acetylcholine Muscle action, memory Increased arousal, enhanced cognition
Beta-endorphin Pain, pleasure Decreased anxiety, decreased tension
Dopamine Mood, sleep, learning Increased pleasure, suppressed appetite
Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) Brain function, sleep Decreased anxiety, decreased tension
Glutamate Memory, learning Increased learning, enhanced memory
Norepinephrine Heart, intestines, alertness Increased arousal, suppressed appetite
Serotonin Mood, sleep Modulated mood, suppressed appetite
TABLE 3.1
Psychoactive drugs can act as agonists or antagonists for a given neurotransmitter system. Agonists are
chemicals that mimic a neurotransmitter at the receptor site. An antagonist, on the other hand, blocks or
impedes the normal activity of a neurotransmitter at the receptor. Agonists and antagonists represent drugs
that are prescribed to correct the specific neurotransmitter imbalances underlying a person’s condition. For
example, Parkinson's disease, a progressive nervous system disorder, is associated with low levels of
dopamine. Therefore, a common treatment strategy for Parkinson's disease involves using dopamine agonists,
which mimic the effects of dopamine by binding to dopamine receptors.
Certain symptoms of schizophrenia are associated with overactive dopamine neurotransmission. The
antipsychotics used to treat these symptoms are antagonists for dopamine—they block dopamine’s effects by
binding its receptors without activating them. Thus, they prevent dopamine released by one neuron from
signaling information to adjacent neurons.
In contrast to agonists and antagonists, which both operate by binding to receptor sites, reuptake inhibitors
prevent unused neurotransmitters from being transported back to the neuron. This allows neurotransmitters
to remain active in the synaptic cleft for longer durations, increasing their effectiveness. Depression, which
has been consistently linked with reduced serotonin levels, is commonly treated with selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). By preventing reuptake, SSRIs strengthen the effect of serotonin, giving it more
time to interact with serotonin receptors on dendrites. Common SSRIs on the market today include Prozac,
Paxil, and Zoloft. The drug LSD is structurally very similar to serotonin, and it affects the same neurons and
receptors as serotonin. Psychotropic drugs are not instant solutions for people suffering from psychological
disorders. Often, an individual must take a drug for several weeks before seeing improvement, and many
3.2 • Cells of the Nervous System 83
psychoactive drugs have significant negative side effects. Furthermore, individuals vary dramatically in how
they respond to the drugs. To improve chances for success, it is not uncommon for people receiving
pharmacotherapy to undergo psychological and/or behavioral therapies as well. Some research suggests that
combining drug therapy with other forms of therapy tends to be more effective than any one treatment alone
(for one such example, see March et al., 2007).
3.3 Parts of the Nervous System
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the difference between the central and peripheral nervous systems
• Explain the difference between the somatic and autonomic nervous systems
• Differentiate between the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system
The nervous system can be divided into two major subdivisions: the central nervous system (CNS) and the
peripheral nervous system (PNS), shown in Figure 3.13. The CNS is comprised of the brain and spinal cord;
the PNS connects the CNS to the rest of the body. In this section, we focus on the peripheral nervous system;
later, we look at the brain and spinal cord.
FIGURE 3.13 The nervous system is divided into two major parts: (a) the Central Nervous System and (b) the
Peripheral Nervous System.
Peripheral Nervous System
The peripheral nervous system is made up of thick bundles of axons, called nerves, carrying messages back
and forth between the CNS and the muscles, organs, and senses in the periphery of the body (i.e., everything
outside the CNS). The PNS has two major subdivisions: the somatic nervous system and the autonomic
84 3 • Biopsychology

nervous system.
The somatic nervous system is associated with activities traditionally thought of as conscious or voluntary. It
is involved in the relay of sensory and motor information to and from the CNS; therefore, it consists of motor
neurons and sensory neurons. Motor neurons, carrying instructions from the CNS to the muscles, are efferent
fibers (efferent means “moving away from”). Sensory neurons, carrying sensory information to the CNS, are
afferent fibers (afferent means “moving toward”). A helpful way to remember this is that efferent = exit and
afferent = arrive. Each nerve is basically a bundle of neurons forming a two-way superhighway, containing
thousands of axons, both efferent and afferent.
The autonomic nervous system controls our internal organs and glands and is generally considered to be
outside the realm of voluntary control. It can be further subdivided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic
divisions (Figure 3.14). The sympathetic nervous system is involved in preparing the body for stress-related
activities; the parasympathetic nervous system is associated with returning the body to routine, day-to-day
operations. The two systems have complementary functions, operating in tandem to maintain the body’s
homeostasis. Homeostasis is a state of equilibrium, or balance, in which biological conditions (such as body
temperature) are maintained at optimal levels.
FIGURE 3.14 The sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system have the opposite
effects on various systems.
The sympathetic nervous system is activated when we are faced with stressful or high-arousal situations. The
activity of this system was adaptive for our ancestors, increasing their chances of survival. Imagine, for
example, that one of our early ancestors, out hunting small game, suddenly disturbs a large bear with her cubs.
At that moment, the hunter's body undergoes a series of changes—a direct function of sympathetic
activation—preparing them to face the threat. The pupils dilate, the heart rate and blood pressure increase, the
bladder relaxes, and the liver releases glucose; adrenaline surges into the bloodstream. This constellation of

Summary
3.1 Human Genetics
Genes are sequences of DNA that code for a particular trait. Different versions of a gene are called
alleles—sometimes alleles can be classified as dominant or recessive. A dominant allele always results in the
dominant phenotype. In order to exhibit a recessive phenotype, an individual must be homozygous for the
recessive allele. Genes affect both physical and psychological characteristics. Ultimately, how and when a gene
is expressed, and what the outcome will be—in terms of both physical and psychological characteristics—is a
function of the interaction between our genes and our environments.
3.2 Cells of the Nervous System
Glia and neurons are the two cell types that make up the nervous system. While glia generally play supporting
roles, the communication between neurons is fundamental to all of the functions associated with the nervous
system. Neuronal communication is made possible by the neuron’s specialized structures. The soma contains
the cell nucleus, and the dendrites extend from the soma in tree-like branches. The axon is another major
extension of the cell body; axons are often covered by a myelin sheath, which increases the speed of
transmission of neural impulses. At the end of the axon are terminal buttons that contain synaptic vesicles
filled with neurotransmitters.
Neuronal communication is an electrochemical event. The dendrites contain receptors for neurotransmitters
released by nearby neurons. If the signals received from other neurons are sufficiently strong, an action
potential will travel down the length of the axon to the terminal buttons, resulting in the release of
neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. Action potentials operate on the all-or-none principle and involve

the movement of Na+ and K+ across the neuronal membrane.
Different neurotransmitters are associated with different functions. Often, psychological disorders involve
imbalances in a given neurotransmitter system. Therefore, psychotropic drugs are prescribed in an attempt to
bring the neurotransmitters back into balance. Drugs can act either as agonists or as antagonists for a given
neurotransmitter system.
3.3 Parts of the Nervous System
The brain and spinal cord make up the central nervous system. The peripheral nervous system is comprised of
the somatic and autonomic nervous systems. The somatic nervous system transmits sensory and motor
signals to and from the central nervous system. The autonomic nervous system controls the function of our
organs and glands, and can be divided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions. Sympathetic
activation prepares us for fight or flight, while parasympathetic activation is associated with normal
functioning under relaxed conditions.
3.4 The Brain and Spinal Cord
The brain consists of two hemispheres, each controlling the opposite side of the body. Each hemisphere can be
subdivided into different lobes: frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital. In addition to the lobes of the
cerebral cortex, the forebrain includes the thalamus (sensory relay) and limbic system (emotion and memory
circuit). The midbrain contains the reticular formation, which is important for sleep and arousal, as well as the
substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area. These structures are important for movement, reward, and
addictive processes. The hindbrain contains the structures of the brainstem (medulla, pons, and midbrain),
which control automatic functions like breathing and blood pressure. The hindbrain also contains the
cerebellum, which helps coordinate movement and certain types of memories.
Individuals with brain damage have been studied extensively to provide information about the role of different
areas of the brain, and recent advances in technology allow us to glean similar information by imaging brain
structure and function. These techniques include CT, PET, MRI, fMRI, and EEG.
3.5 The Endocrine System
The glands of the endocrine system secrete hormones to regulate normal body functions. The hypothalamus
serves as the interface between the nervous system and the endocrine system, and it controls the secretions of
the pituitary. The pituitary serves as the master gland, controlling the secretions of all other glands. The
thyroid secretes thyroxine, which is important for basic metabolic processes and growth; the adrenal glands
secrete hormones involved in the stress response; the pancreas secretes hormones that regulate blood sugar
levels; and the ovaries and testes produce sex hormones that regulate sexual motivation and behavior.

The epigenetic perspective is very different from range of reaction, because here the genotype is not fixed and limited. LINK T O LEARNING Watch this video about the epigenetics of twin studies (http://openstax.org/l/twinstudy) to learn more. Genes affect more than our physical characteristics. Indeed, scientists have found genetic linkages to a number of behavioral characteristics, ranging from basic personality traits to sexual orientation to spirituality (for examples, see Mustanski et al., 2005; Comings, Gonzales, Saucier, Johnson, & MacMurray, 2000). Genes are also associated with temperament and a number of psychological disorders, such as depression and schizophrenia. So while it is true that genes provide the biological blueprints for our cells, tissues, organs, and body, they also have a significant impact on our experiences and our behaviors. Let’s look at the following findings regarding schizophrenia in light of our three views of gene-environment interactions. Which view do you think best explains this evidence? In a 2004 study by Tienari and colleagues, adoptees whose biological mothers had schizophrenia and who had been raised in a disturbed family environment were much more likely to develop schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder than were any of the other groups in the study: • Of adoptees whose biological mothers had schizophrenia (high genetic risk) and who were raised in disturbed family environments, 36.8% were likely to develop schizophrenia. • Of adoptees whose biological mothers had schizophrenia (high genetic risk) and who were raised in healthy family environments, 5.8% were likely to develop schizophrenia. • Of adoptees with a low genetic risk (whose mothers did not have schizophrenia) and who were raised in disturbed family environments, 5.3% were likely to develop schizophrenia. • Of adoptees with a low genetic risk (whose mothers did not have schizophrenia) and who were raised in healthy family environments, 4.8% were likely to develop schizophrenia. The study shows that adoptees with high genetic risk were most likely to develop schizophrenia if they were raised in disturbed home environments. This is consistent with our view that the environment plays a major role in determining whether or not an individual will develop a psychological disorder. In contrast, the study suggests that if an adoptee’s biological mother had no schizophrenia, she would not be at risk for developing a psychotic disorder, even if she had raised her adoptive child in an environment of high genetic risk. In another study, researchers found that children of mothers with schizophrenia had a significantly higher risk of developing schizophrenia than did children whose mothers were not schizophrenic. They also found that the risk of schizophrenia was significantly greater for boys than for girls. These findings are consistent with our views on the role of genetics in schizophrenia. For example, we know that schizophrenia is more common in males than in females and that boys are at greater risk than girls for developing the disorder. However, these findings do not necessarily mean that genetics is the only factor that determines whether or not a child develops a mental illness. There are many other factors that may play a role, including environmental factors and biological factors, as well as both genetic and non-genetic factors. Therefore, it is important to consider all of these factors when trying to understand why some children develop mental illnesses and others don’t. Another example of how genetics and environment interact can be found in studies of twins. Researchers found that identical twins raised together were less likely than fraternal (non-identical) twins to become twin sisters or brothers. However, when the twins were separated at birth and raised apart, there was no significant difference in their likelihood of becoming twin sisters and brothers. These findings suggest that genetic factors are important, but they are not the whole story. It is also important to recognize that environmental factors can play an important role in shaping a person’s characteristics and behaviors, just as they do in other areas of life. Environmental factors include families, friends, schools, neighborhoods, etc. Just as genetics can influence our behavior, so too can our experiences and interactions with the world around us.","{""sections"": [""Biopsychology/The Brain and Spinal Cord"", ""States of Consciousness/Sleep and Why We Sleep""], ""pages"": [""92"", ""95"", ""115""]}"
42,"FIGURE 11.8 Alfred Adler proposed the concept of the inferiority complex.
Adler also believed in the importance of social connections, seeing childhood development emerging through
social development rather than the sexual stages Freud outlined. Adler noted the inter-relatedness of
humanity and the need to work together for the betterment of all. He said, “The happiness of mankind lies in
working together, in living as if each individual had set himself the task of contributing to the common welfare”
(Adler, 1964, p. 255) with the main goal of psychology being “to recognize the equal rights and equality of
others” (Adler, 1961, p. 691).
With these ideas, Adler identified three fundamental social tasks that all of us must experience: occupational
tasks (careers), societal tasks (friendship), and love tasks (finding an intimate partner for a long-term
relationship). Rather than focus on sexual or aggressive motives for behavior as Freud did, Adler focused on
social motives. He also emphasized conscious rather than unconscious motivation, since he believed that the
three fundamental social tasks are explicitly known and pursued. That is not to say that Adler did not also
believe in unconscious processes—he did—but he felt that conscious processes were more important.
One of Adler’s major contributions to personality psychology was the idea that our birth order shapes our
personality. He proposed that older siblings, who start out as the focus of their parents’ attention but must
share that attention once a new child joins the family, compensate by becoming overachievers. The youngest
children, according to Adler, may be spoiled, leaving the middle child with the opportunity to minimize the
negative dynamics of the youngest and oldest children. Despite popular attention, research has not
conclusively confirmed Adler’s hypotheses about birth order.

Erik Erikson
As an art school dropout with an uncertain future, young Erik Erikson met Freud’s daughter, Anna Freud, while
he was tutoring the children of an American couple undergoing psychoanalysis in Vienna. It was Anna Freud
who encouraged Erikson to study psychoanalysis. Erikson received his diploma from the Vienna
Psychoanalytic Institute in 1933, and as Nazism spread across Europe, he fled the country and immigrated to
the United States that same year. As you learned when you studied lifespan development, Erikson later
proposed a psychosocial theory of development, suggesting that an individual’s personality develops
throughout the lifespan—a departure from Freud’s view that personality is fixed in early life. In his theory,
Erikson emphasized the social relationships that are important at each stage of personality development, in
contrast to Freud’s emphasis on sex. Erikson identified eight stages, each of which represents a conflict or
developmental task (Table 11.2). The development of a healthy personality and a sense of competence depend
on the successful completion of each task.

TABLE 11.2
Carl Jung
Carl Jung (Figure 11.9) was a Swiss psychiatrist and protégé of Freud, who later split off from Freud and
developed his own theory, which he called analytical psychology. The focus of analytical psychology is on
working to balance opposing forces of conscious and unconscious thought, and experience within one’s
personality. According to Jung, this work is a continuous learning process—mainly occurring in the second half
of life—of becoming aware of unconscious elements and integrating them into consciousness.

FIGURE 11.9 Carl Jung was interested in exploring the collective unconscious.
Jung’s split from Freud was based on two major disagreements. First, Jung, like Adler and Erikson, did not
accept that sexual drive was the primary motivator in a person’s mental life. Second, although Jung agreed
with Freud’s concept of a personal unconscious, he thought it to be incomplete. In addition to the personal
unconscious, Jung focused on the collective unconscious.
The collective unconscious is a universal version of the personal unconscious, holding mental patterns, or
memory traces, which are common to all of us (Jung, 1928). These ancestral memories, which Jung called
archetypes, are represented by universal themes in various cultures, as expressed through literature, art, and
dreams (Jung). Jung said that these themes reflect common experiences of people the world over, such as
facing death, becoming independent, and striving for mastery. Jung (1964) believed that through biology, each
person is handed down the same themes and that the same types of symbols—such as the hero, the maiden,
the sage, and the trickster—are present in the folklore and fairy tales of every culture. In Jung’s view, the task of
integrating these unconscious archetypal aspects of the self is part of the self-realization process in the second
half of life. With this orientation toward self-realization, Jung parted ways with Freud’s belief that personality is
determined solely by past events and anticipated the humanistic movement with its emphasis on self-
actualization and orientation toward the future.
Jung also proposed two attitudes or approaches toward life: extroversion and introversion (Jung, 1923) (Table
11.3). These ideas are considered Jung’s most important contributions to the field of personality psychology,
as almost all models of personality now include these concepts. If you are an extrovert, then you are a person
who is energized by being outgoing and socially oriented: You derive your energy from being around others. If
you are an introvert, then you are a person who may be quiet and reserved, or you may be social, but your
energy is derived from your inner psychic activity. Jung believed a balance between extroversion and
introversion best served the goal of self-realization.

TABLE 11.3
Another concept proposed by Jung was the persona, which he referred to as a mask that we adopt. According
to Jung, we consciously create this persona; however, it is derived from both our conscious experiences and
our collective unconscious. What is the purpose of the persona? Jung believed that it is a compromise between
who we really are (our true self) and what society expects us to be. We hide those parts of ourselves that are not
aligned with society’s expectations.
LINK T O LEARNING
Jung’s view of extroverted and introverted types serves as a basis of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI).
This questionnaire describes a person’s degree of introversion versus extroversion, thinking versus feeling,
intuition versus sensation, and judging versus perceiving. Take this modified questionnaire based on the MBTI
(http://openstax.org/l/myersbriggs) to learn more.
Are Archetypes Genetically Based?
Jung proposed that human responses to archetypes are similar to instinctual responses in animals. One criticism of
Jung is that there is no evidence that archetypes are biologically based or similar to animal instincts (Roesler, 2012).
Jung formulated his ideas about 100 years ago, and great advances have been made in the field of genetics since
that time. We’ve found that human babies are born with certain capacities, including the ability to acquire language.
However, we’ve also found that symbolic information (such as archetypes) is not encoded on the genome and that
babies cannot decode symbolism, refuting the idea of a biological basis to archetypes. Rather than being seen as
purely biological, more recent research suggests that archetypes emerge directly from our experiences and are
reflections of linguistic or cultural characteristics (Young-Eisendrath, 1995). Today, most Jungian scholars believe
that the collective unconscious and archetypes are based on both innate and environmental influences, with the
differences being in the role and degree of each (Sotirova-Kohli et al., 2013).
Karen Horney
Karen Horney was one of the first women trained as a Freudian psychoanalyst. During the Great Depression,
Horney moved from Germany to the United States, and subsequently moved away from Freud’s teachings. Like
Jung, Horney believed that each individual has the potential for self-realization and that the goal of
psychoanalysis should be moving toward a healthy self rather than exploring early childhood patterns of

dysfunction. Horney also disagreed with the Freudian idea that girls have penis envy and are jealous of male
biological features. According to Horney, any jealousy is most likely culturally based, due to the greater
privileges that men often have, meaning that the differences between men’s and women’s personalities are
culturally based, not biologically based. She further suggested that men have womb envy, because they cannot
give birth.
Horney’s theories focused on the role of unconscious anxiety. She suggested that normal growth can be
blocked by basic anxiety stemming from needs not being met, such as childhood experiences of loneliness
and/or isolation. How do children learn to handle this anxiety? Horney suggested three styles of coping (Table
11.4). The first coping style, moving toward people, relies on affiliation and dependence. These children
become dependent on their parents and other caregivers in an effort to receive attention and affection, which
provides relief from anxiety (Burger, 2008). When these children grow up, they tend to use this same coping
strategy to deal with relationships, expressing an intense need for love and acceptance (Burger, 2008). The
second coping style, moving against people, relies on aggression and assertiveness. Children with this coping
style find that fighting is the best way to deal with an unhappy home situation, and they deal with their feelings
of insecurity by bullying other children (Burger, 2008). As adults, people with this coping style tend to lash out
with hurtful comments and exploit others (Burger, 2008). The third coping style, moving away from people,
centers on detachment and isolation. These children handle their anxiety by withdrawing from the world. They
need privacy and tend to be self-sufficient. When these children are adults, they continue to avoid such things
as love and friendship, and they also tend to gravitate toward careers that require little interaction with others
(Burger, 2008).

TABLE 11.4
Horney believed these three styles are ways in which people typically cope with day-to-day problems; however,
the three coping styles can become neurotic strategies if they are used rigidly and compulsively, leading a
person to become alienated from others.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the behaviorist perspective on personality
• Describe the cognitive perspective on personality
• Describe the social cognitive perspective on personality
In contrast to the psychodynamic approaches of Freud and the neo-Freudians, which relate personality to
inner (and hidden) processes, the learning approaches focus only on observable behavior. This illustrates one
significant advantage of the learning approaches over psychodynamics: Because learning approaches involve
observable, measurable phenomena, they can be scientifically tested.

13.2 Industrial Psychology: Selecting and Evaluating Employees
13.3 Organizational Psychology: The Social Dimension of Work
13.4 Human Factors Psychology and Workplace Design
In October 2019, Social Security Administration Commissioner Andrew Saul announced that
the Social Security Administration would end a telework program it began 6 years previous serving
approximately 12,000 of its employees. Then-Deputy Commissioner Grace Kim wrote a letter to Social Security
employees explaining the reasons the program was ending and cited an increased workload and a backlog of
cases as reasons for ending the pilot program. This change in the telework policy came on the heels of a
negotiation between the American Federal Government Employee Union and the Social Security
Administration, a negotiation that had to be brokered by the Federal Services Impasse Panel (a third-party
federal organization developed specifically to arbitrate in situations where negotiations between union
officials and federal organizations break down and progress halts between the organization and the union
representatives) (Wagner, 2019a).
The May 2019 decision by the panel gave Social Security Agency managers the ability to limit or restrict
telework for employees using their discretion to ensure that all tasks were being completed and wait times
were normal. One of the biggest reasons cited for this was that the organization was able to provide evidence
that after the implementation of a telework program, the average wait time for individuals temporarily
increased, causing a backlog of work to be completed at a later date. Although the Social Security
Administration pushed the official end date for all telework in the agency to March of 2020, the program was
officially ended. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress requested a review of the telework policy
and raised questions about whether it should be revived to serve as a preventative measure for reducing and
slowing the spread of the virus (Wagner, 2019b). Could this allow employees to continue working while not
coming to the workplace in order to help prevent the spread of illness? What were the benefits versus the costs
of implementing a telework policy again for employees as the spread of the virus continued? What did
previous research show related to the positive and negative benefits to the organization and the employees
with respect to telework?

Psychology
13.1 What Is Industrial and Organizational Psychology?
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Understand the scope of study in the field of industrial and organizational psychology
• Describe the history of industrial and organizational psychology
In 2019, people who worked in the United States spent an average of about 42–54 hours per week working
(Bureau of Labor Statistics—U.S. Department of Labor, 2019). Sleeping was the only other activity they spent
more time on with an average of about 43–62 hours per week. The workday is a significant portion of workers’
time and energy. It impacts their lives and their family’s lives in positive and negative physical and
psychological ways. Industrial and organizational (I-O) psychology is a branch of psychology that studies
how human behavior and psychology affect work and how they are affected by work.
Industrial and organizational psychologists work in four main contexts: academia, government, consulting
firms, and business. Most I-O psychologists have a master’s or doctorate degree. The field of I-O psychology can
be divided into three broad areas (Figure 13.2 and Figure 13.3): industrial, organizational, and human factors.
Industrial psychology is concerned with describing job requirements and assessing individuals for their
ability to meet those requirements. In addition, once employees are hired, industrial psychology studies and
develops ways to train, evaluate, and respond to those evaluations. As a consequence of its concern for
candidate characteristics, industrial psychology must also consider issues of legality regarding discrimination
in hiring. Organizational psychology is a discipline interested in how the relationships among employees
affect those employees and the performance of a business. This includes studying worker satisfaction,
motivation, and commitment. This field also studies management, leadership, and organizational culture, as
well as how an organization’s structures, management and leadership styles, social norms, and role
expectations affect individual behavior. As a result of its interest in worker wellbeing and relationships,
organizational psychology also considers the subjects of harassment, including sexual harassment, and
workplace violence. Human factors psychology is the study of how workers interact with the tools of work and
how to design those tools to optimize workers’ productivity, safety, and health. These studies can involve
interactions as straightforward as the fit of a desk, chair, and computer to a human having to sit on the chair at
the desk using the computer for several hours each day. They can also include the examination of how humans
interact with complex displays and their ability to interpret them accurately and quickly. In Europe, this field is
referred to as ergonomics.

Occupational health psychology (OHP) deals with the stress, diseases, and disorders that can affect employees
as a result of the workplace. As such, the field is informed by research from the medical, biological,
psychological, organizational, human factors, human resources, and industrial fields. Individuals in this field
seek to examine the ways in which the organization affects the quality of work life for an employee and the
responses that employees have towards their organization or as a result of their organization’s influence on
them. The responses for employees are not limited to the workplace as there may be some spillover into their
personal lives outside of work, especially if there is not good work-life balance. The ultimate goal of an
occupational health psychologist is to improve the overall health and well-being of an individual, and, as a
result, increase the overall health of the organization (Society for Occupational Health Psychology, 2020).
In 2009, the field of humanitarian work psychology (HWP) was developed as the brainchild of a small group of
I-O psychologists who met at a conference. Realizing they had a shared set of goals involving helping those who
are underserved and underprivileged, the I-O psychologists formally formed the group in 2012 and have
approximately 300 members worldwide. Although this is a small number, the group continues to expand. The
13.1 • What Is Industrial and Organizational Psychology? 449
group seeks to help marginalized members of society, such as people with low-income, find work. In addition,
they help to determine ways to deliver humanitarian aid during major catastrophes. The Humanitarian Work
Psychology group can also reach out to those in the local community who do not have the knowledge, skills,
and abilities (KSAs) to be able to find gainful employment that would enable them to not need to receive aid. In
both cases, humanitarian work psychologists try to help the underserved individuals develop KSAs that they
can use to improve their lives and their current situations. When ensuring these underserved individuals
receive training or education, the focus is on skills that, once learned, will never be forgotten and can serve
individuals throughout their lifetimes as they seek employment (APA, 2016). Table 13.1 summarizes the main
fields in I-O psychology, their focuses, and jobs within each field.

TABLE 13.4
As an example of research in human factors psychology Bruno & Abrahão (2012) examined the impact of the
volume of operator decisions on the accuracy of decisions made within an information security center at a
banking institution in Brazil. The study examined a total of about 45,000 decisions made by 35 operators and
4 managers over a period of 60 days. Their study found that as the number of decisions made per day by the
operators climbed, that is, as their cognitive effort increased, the operators made more mistakes in falsely
identifying incidents as real security breaches (when, in reality, they were not). Interestingly, the opposite
mistake of identifying real intrusions as false alarms did not increase with increased cognitive demand. This
appears to be good news for the bank, since false alarms are not as costly as incorrectly rejecting a genuine
threat. These kinds of studies combine research on attention, perception, teamwork, and human–computer
interactions in a field of considerable societal and business significance. This is exactly the context of the
events that led to the massive data breach for Target in the fall of 2013. Indications are that security personnel
received signals of a security breach but did not interpret them correctly, thus allowing the breach to continue
for two weeks until an outside agency, the FBI, informed the company (Riley, Elgin, Lawrence, & Matlack,
2014).

Summary
13.1 What Is Industrial and Organizational Psychology?
The field of I-O psychology had its birth in industrial psychology and the use of psychological concepts to aid in
personnel selection. However, with research such as the Hawthorne study, it was found that productivity was
affected more by human interaction and not physical factors; the field of industrial psychology expanded to
include organizational psychology. Both WWI and WWII had a strong influence on the development of an
expansion of industrial psychology in the United States and elsewhere: The tasks the psychologists were
assigned led to development of tests and research in how the psychological concepts could assist industry and
other areas. This movement aided in expanding industrial psychology to include organizational psychology.
13.2 Industrial Psychology: Selecting and Evaluating Employees
Industrial psychology studies the attributes of jobs, applicants of those jobs, and methods for assessing fit to a
job. These procedures include job analysis, applicant testing, and interviews. It also studies and puts into place
procedures for the orientation of new employees and ongoing training of employees. The process of hiring
employees can be vulnerable to bias, which is illegal, and industrial psychologists must develop methods for
adhering to the law in hiring. Performance appraisal systems are an active area of research and practice in
industrial psychology.
13.3 Organizational Psychology: The Social Dimension of Work
Organizational psychology is concerned with the effects of interactions among people in the workplace on the
employees themselves and on organizational productivity. Job satisfaction and its determinants and outcomes
are a major focus of organizational psychology research and practice. Organizational psychologists have also
studied the effects of management styles and leadership styles on productivity. In addition to the employees
and management, organizational psychology also looks at the organizational culture and how that might affect
productivity. One aspect of organization culture is the prevention and addressing of sexual and other forms of
harassment in the workplace. Sexual harassment includes language, behavior, or displays that create a hostile
environment; it also includes sexual favors requested in exchange for workplace rewards (i.e., quid pro quo).
Industrial-organizational psychology has conducted extensive research on the triggers and causes of
workplace violence and safety. This enables the organization to establish procedures that can identify these
triggers before they become a problem.
13.4 Human Factors Psychology and Workplace Design
Human factors psychology, or ergonomics, studies the interface between workers and their machines and
physical environments. Human factors psychologists specifically seek to design machines to better support
the workers using them. Psychologists may be involved in design of work tools such as software, displays, or
machines from the beginning of the design process or during the testing an already developed product.
Human factor psychologists are also involved in the development of best design recommendations and
regulations. One important aspect of human factors psychology is enhancing worker safety. Human factors
research involves efforts to understand and improve interactions between technology systems and their
human operators. Human–software interactions are a large sector of this research.

Context: FIGURE 11.8 Alfred Adler proposed the concept of the inferiority complex. Adler also believed in the importance of social connections, seeing childhood development emerging through social development rather than the sexual stages Freud outlined. Adler noted the inter-relatedness of humanity and the need to work together for the betterment of all. He said, “The happiness of mankind lies in working together, in living as if each individual had set himself the task of contributing to the common welfare” (Adler, 1964, p. 255) with the main goal of psychology being “to recognize the equal rights and equality of others” (Adler, 1961, p. 691). With these ideas, Adler identified three fundamental social tasks that all of us must experience: occupational tasks (careers), societal tasks (friendship), and love tasks (finding an intimate partner for a long-term relationship). Rather than focus on sexual or aggressive motives for behavior as Freud did, Adler focused on social motives. He also emphasized conscious rather than unconscious motivation, since he believed that the three fundamental social tasks are explicitly known and pursued. That is not to say that Adler did not also believe in unconscious processes—he did—but he felt that conscious processes were more important. One of Adler’s major contributions to personality psychology was the idea that our birth order shapes our personality. He proposed that older siblings, who start out as the focus of their parents’ attention but must share that attention once a new child joins the family, compensate by becoming overachievers. The youngest children, according to Adler, may be spoiled, leaving the middle child with the opportunity to minimize the negative dynamics of the youngest and oldest children. Despite popular attention, research has not conclusively confirmed Adler’s hypotheses about birth order. LINK T O LEARNING One of Adler’s major contributions to personality psychology was the idea that our birth order shapes our personality. View this summary of birth order theory (http://openstax.org/l/best) to learn more. Erik Erikson As an art school dropout with an uncertain future, young Erik Erikson met Freud’s daughter, Anna Freud, while he was tutoring the children of an old woman in a psychiatric hospital. Freud and his wife, Sigmund Freud, encouraged Erik to pursue a career in psychiatry. Erik’s mother, however, strongly opposed him from entering the profession, and he was forced to drop out of medical school at the age of 30. In the years that followed, Erik worked as a social worker in New York City and as an assistant professor at Columbia University’s School of Social Work. During this time, he became interested in psychoanalysis and began studying the work of Carl Jung, the Swiss psychiatrist who developed the analytical method of psychoanalytic psychotherapy. Jung’s ideas about the unconscious mind, which he called the “shadow” or “repressed memory,” had a profound impact on Erik. His interest in Jung led him to become a Jungian analyst and to write his first book on the subject, The Unconscious: An Interpretation of Dreams and Other Psychological Dreams (1892). In this book, Jung argued that dreams are a reflection of our unconscious thoughts and feelings. According to his theory, we are born with a set of unconscious desires and needs that we must work through in order to grow and develop into the person we want to be. This process of growth and development is referred to as “transcendence,” and it is this process that Erik wanted to study in his work with young adolescents. Link to Learning The following video provides a brief overview of Erik's life and work. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2008781014) Erich Eriksson was born in Stockholm, Sweden, on January 9,1795. As a child, his family was poor, but his father was a successful businessman who encouraged his children to follow their interests and pursue their own dreams. When Erik was eight years old, they moved to a small town in southern Sweden where he attended a private school. There he began to develop a love for art and music. By the time he graduated from high school, he had already been accepted into a boarding school for young boys. While there he developed a passion for psychiatry and became a member of a group of young men who were studying under the tutelage of Dr. Carl Hippocrates, a famous Greek physician. Hippocrates was known for his studies of human anatomy and was considered the father of modern medicine","{""sections"": [""Stress, Lifestyle, and Health/What Is Stress?"", ""Industrial-Organizational Psychology/Industrial Psychology: Selecting and Evaluating Employees"", ""Personality/Trait Theorists""], ""pages"": [""493"", ""460"", ""383""]}"
43,"equally likely to give dispositional and external explanations. This supports the idea that actors tend to provide
few internal explanations but many situational explanations for their own behavior. In contrast, observers tend
to provide more dispositional explanations for a friend’s behavior (Figure 12.5).
FIGURE 12.5 Actor-observer bias is evident when subjects explain their own reasons for liking a girlfriend versus
their impressions of others’ reasons for liking a girlfriend.
Self-Serving Bias
We can understand self-serving bias by digging more deeply into attribution, a belief about the cause of a
result. One model of attribution proposes three main dimensions: locus of control (internal versus external),
stability (stable versus unstable), and controllability (controllable versus uncontrollable). In this context,
stability refers to the extent in which the circumstances that result in a given outcome are changeable. The
circumstances are considered stable if they are unlikely to change. Controllability refers to the extent to which
the circumstances that are associated with a given outcome can be controlled. Obviously, those things that we
have the power to control would be labeled controllable (Weiner, 1979).
Following an outcome, self-serving biases are those attributions that enable us to see ourselves in a favorable
light (for example, making internal attributions for success and external attributions for failures). When you do
well at a task, for example acing an exam, it is in your best interest to make a dispositional attribution for your
behavior (“I’m smart,”) instead of a situational one (“The exam was easy,”). Self-serving bias is the tendency to
explain our successes as due to dispositional (internal) characteristics, but to explain our failures as due to
situational (external) factors. Again, this is culture dependent. This bias serves to protect self-esteem. You can
imagine that if people always made situational attributions for their behavior, they would never be able to take
credit and feel good about their accomplishments.
Consider the example of how we explain our favorite sports team’s wins. Research shows that we make
internal, stable, and controllable attributions for our team’s victory (Figure 12.6) (Grove, Hanrahan, &
McInman, 1991). For example, we might tell ourselves that our team is talented (internal), consistently works
hard (stable), and uses effective strategies (controllable). In contrast, we are more likely to make external,
unstable, and uncontrollable attributions when our favorite team loses. For example, we might tell ourselves
that the other team has more experienced players or that the referees were unfair (external), the other team
played at home (unstable), and the cold weather affected our team’s performance (uncontrollable).

Just-World Hypothesis
One consequence of westerners’ tendency to provide dispositional explanations for behavior is victim blame
(Jost & Major, 2001). When people experience bad fortune, others tend to assume that they somehow are
responsible for their own fate. A common ideology, or worldview, in the United States is the just-world
hypothesis. The just-world hypothesis is the belief that people get the outcomes they deserve (Lerner & Miller,
1978). In order to maintain the belief that the world is a fair place, people tend to think that good people
experience positive outcomes, and bad people experience negative outcomes (Jost, Banaji, & Nosek, 2004; Jost
& Major, 2001). The ability to think of the world as a fair place, where people get what they deserve, allows us to
feel that the world is predictable and that we have some control over our life outcomes (Jost et al., 2004; Jost &
Major, 2001). For example, if you want to experience positive outcomes, you just need to work hard to get
ahead in life.
Can you think of a negative consequence of the just-world hypothesis? One negative consequence is people’s
tendency to blame poor individuals for their plight. What common explanations are given for why people live
in poverty? Have you heard statements such as, “The poor are lazy and just don’t want to work” or “Poor
people just want to live off the government”? What types of explanations are these, dispositional or situational?
These dispositional explanations are clear examples of the fundamental attribution error. Blaming poor people
for their poverty ignores situational factors that impact them, such as high unemployment rates, recession,
poor educational opportunities, and the familial cycle of poverty (Figure 12.7). Other research shows that
people who hold just-world beliefs have negative attitudes toward people who are unemployed and people
living with AIDS (Sutton & Douglas, 2005). In the United States and other countries, victims of sexual assault
may find themselves blamed for their abuse. Victim advocacy groups, such as Domestic Violence Ended
(DOVE), attend court in support of victims to ensure that blame is directed at the perpetrators of sexual
violence, not the victims.

12.1 • What Is Social Psychology? 405
12.2 Self-presentation
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe social roles and how they influence behavior
• Explain what social norms are and how they influence behavior
• Define script
• Describe the findings and criticisms of Zimbardo’s Stanford prison experiment
As you’ve learned, social psychology is the study of how people affect one another’s thoughts, feelings, and
behaviors. We have discussed situational perspectives and social psychology’s emphasis on the ways in which
a person’s environment, including culture and other social influences, affect behavior. In this section, we
examine situational forces that have a strong influence on human behavior including social roles, social
norms, and scripts. We discuss how humans use the social environment as a source of information, or cues, on
how to behave. Situational influences on our behavior have important consequences, such as whether we will
help a stranger in an emergency or how we would behave in an unfamiliar environment.
Social Roles
One major social determinant of human behavior is our social roles. A social role is a pattern of behavior that
is expected of a person in a given setting or group (Hare, 2003). Each one of us has several social roles. You
may be, at the same time, a student, a parent, an aspiring teacher, a son or daughter, a spouse, and a lifeguard.
How do these social roles influence your behavior? Social roles are defined by culturally shared knowledge.
That is, nearly everyone in a given culture knows what behavior is expected of a person in a given role. For
example, what is the social role for a student? If you look around a college classroom you will likely see
students engaging in studious behavior, taking notes, listening to the professor, reading the textbook, and
sitting quietly at their desks (Figure 12.8). Of course you may see students deviating from the expected
studious behavior such as texting on their phones or using Facebook on their laptops, but in all cases, the
students that you observe are attending class—a part of the social role of students.
FIGURE 12.8 Being a student is just one of the many social roles you have. (credit: modification of work by “Rural
Institute”/Flickr)
Social roles, and our related behavior, can vary across different settings. How do you behave when you are
engaging in the role of a child attending a family function? Now imagine how you behave when you are
engaged in the role of employee at your workplace. It is very likely that your behavior will be different. Perhaps
you are more relaxed and outgoing with your family, making jokes and doing silly things. But at your workplace
you might speak more professionally, and although you may be friendly, you are also serious and focused on
getting the work completed. These are examples of how our social roles influence and often dictate our
behavior to the extent that identity and personality can vary with context (that is, in different social groups)
(Malloy, Albright, Kenny, Agatstein & Winquist, 1997).

Social Norms
As discussed previously, social roles are defined by a culture’s shared knowledge of what is expected behavior
of an individual in a specific role. This shared knowledge comes from social norms. A social norm is a group’s
expectation of what is appropriate and acceptable behavior for its members—how they are supposed to behave
and think (Deutsch & Gerard, 1955; Berkowitz, 2004). How are we expected to act? What are we expected to
talk about? What are we expected to wear? In our discussion of social roles we noted that colleges have social
norms for students’ behavior in the role of student and workplaces have social norms for employees’ behaviors
in the role of employee. Social norms are everywhere including in families, gangs, and on social media outlets.

Tweens, Teens, and Social Norms
My 11-year-old daughter, Janelle, recently told me she needed shorts and shirts for the summer, and that she
wanted me to take her to a store at the mall that is popular with preteens and teens to buy them. I have noticed that
many girls have clothes from that store, so I tried teasing her. I said, “All the shirts say ‘Aero’ on the front. If you are
wearing a shirt like that and you have a substitute teacher, and the other girls are all wearing that type of shirt, won’t
the substitute teacher think you are all named ‘Aero’?”
My daughter replied, in typical 11-year-old fashion, “Mom, you are not funny. Can we please go shopping?”
I tried a different tactic. I asked Janelle if having clothing from that particular store will make her popular. She
replied, “No, it will not make me popular. It is what the popular kids wear. It will make me feel happier.” How can a
label or name brand make someone feel happier? Think back to what you’ve learned about lifespan development.
What is it about pre-teens and young teens that make them want to fit in (Figure 12.9)? Does this change over time?
Think back to your high school experience, or look around your college campus. What is the main name brand
clothing you see? What messages do we get from the media about how to fit in?
FIGURE 12.9 Young people struggle to become independent at the same time they are desperately trying to fit in
with their peers. (credit: Monica Arellano-Ongpin)
Scripts
Because of social roles, people tend to know what behavior is expected of them in specific, familiar settings. A
script is a person’s knowledge about the sequence of events expected in a specific setting (Schank & Abelson,
1977). How do you act on the first day of school, when you walk into an elevator, or are at a restaurant? For
example, at a restaurant in the United States, if we want the server’s attention, we try to make eye contact. In
Brazil, you would make the sound “psst” to get the server’s attention. You can see the cultural differences in
scripts. To an American, saying “psst” to a server might seem rude, yet to a Brazilian, trying to make eye
contact might not seem an effective strategy. Scripts are important sources of information to guide behavior in
given situations. Can you imagine being in an unfamiliar situation and not having a script for how to behave?
This could be uncomfortable and confusing. How could you find out about social norms in an unfamiliar

culture?
Zimbardo’s Stanford Prison Experiment
The famous Stanford prison experiment, conducted by social psychologist Philip Zimbardo and his
colleagues at Stanford University, demonstrated the power of social roles, social norms, and scripts. In the
summer of 1971, an advertisement was placed in a California newspaper asking for male volunteers to
participate in a study about the psychological effects of prison life. More than 70 men volunteered, and these
volunteers then underwent psychological testing to eliminate candidates who had underlying psychiatric
issues, medical issues, or a history of crime or drug abuse. The pool of volunteers was whittled down to 24
healthy male college students. Each student was paid $15 per day (equivalent to about $80 today) and was
randomly assigned to play the role of either a prisoner or a guard in the study. Based on what you have learned
about research methods, why is it important that participants were randomly assigned?
A mock prison was constructed in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford. Participants assigned
to play the role of prisoners were “arrested” at their homes by Palo Alto police officers, booked at a police
station, and subsequently taken to the mock prison. The experiment was scheduled to run for several weeks.
To the surprise of the researchers, both the “prisoners” and “guards” assumed their roles with zeal. On the
second day of the experiment, the guards forced the prisoners to strip, took their beds, and isolated the
ringleaders using solitary confinement. In a relatively short time, the guards came to harass the prisoners in
an increasingly sadistic manner, through a complete lack of privacy, lack of basic comforts such as mattresses
to sleep on, and through degrading chores and late-night counts.
The prisoners, in turn, began to show signs of severe anxiety and hopelessness—they began tolerating the
guards’ abuse. Even the Stanford professor who designed the study and was the head researcher, Philip
Zimbardo, found himself acting as if the prison was real and his role, as prison supervisor, was real as well.
After only six days, the experiment had to be ended due to the participants’ deteriorating behavior. Zimbardo
explained,
At this point it became clear that we had to end the study. We had created an overwhelmingly powerful
situation—a situation in which prisoners were withdrawing and behaving in pathological ways, and in
which some of the guards were behaving sadistically. Even the “good” guards felt helpless to
intervene, and none of the guards quit while the study was in progress. Indeed, it should be noted that
no guard ever came late for his shift, called in sick, left early, or demanded extra pay for overtime
work. (Zimbardo, 2013)
The Stanford Prison Experiment has been used as a memorable demonstration of the incredible power that
social roles, norms, and scripts have in affecting human behavior. However, multiple aspects of the study have
been subject to criticism since its inception. The nature of these criticisms range from ethical concerns to
issues of generalizability (Bartels, Milovich, & Moussier, 2016; Griggs, 2014; Le Texier, 2019). One criticism is
that the way students were recruited for the experiment may have impacted the outcome (Carnahan &
McFarland, 2007). Another criticism questions the conclusions that can be drawn from the study. Zimbardo
appears to have provided specific guidelines of the types of behaviors that were expected of the guards
(Zimbardo, 2007). Subsequent research suggests that such guidelines likely created an expectation of the
types of behavior that Zimbardo reported observing in the Stanford Prison Experiment (Bartels, 2019), and
that given these expectations, the guards simply acted as they thought they were expected to act. It has also
been problematic that attempts to replicate aspects of the study have not been successful. For example, when
no guidelines were presented to the guards, researchers documented different outcomes than those observed
by Zimbardo. (Reicher & Haslam, 2006).
The Stanford Prison Experiment has some parallels with the abuse of prisoners of war by U.S. Army troops and
CIA personnel at the Abu Ghraib prison in 2003 and 2004 during the Iraq War. The offenses at Abu Ghraib were
documented by photographs of the abuse, some taken by the abusers themselves (Figure 12.10).

12.3 Attitudes and Persuasion
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Define attitude
• Describe how people’s attitudes are internally changed through cognitive dissonance
• Explain how people’s attitudes are externally changed through persuasion
• Describe the peripheral and central routes to persuasion
Social psychologists have documented how the power of the situation can influence our behaviors. Now we
turn to how the power of the situation can influence our attitudes and beliefs. Attitude is our evaluation of a
person, an idea, or an object. We have attitudes for many things ranging from products that we might pick up
in the supermarket to people around the world to political policies. Typically, attitudes are favorable or
unfavorable: positive or negative (Eagly & Chaiken, 1993). And, they have three components: an affective
component (feelings), a behavioral component (the effect of the attitude on behavior), and a cognitive
component (belief and knowledge) (Rosenberg & Hovland, 1960).
For example, you may hold a positive attitude toward recycling. This attitude should result in positive feelings
toward recycling (such as “It makes me feel good to recycle” or “I enjoy knowing that I make a small difference
in reducing the amount of waste that ends up in landfills”). Certainly, this attitude should be reflected in our
behavior: You actually recycle as often as you can. Finally, this attitude will be reflected in favorable thoughts
(for example, “Recycling is good for the environment” or “Recycling is the responsible thing to do”).
Our attitudes and beliefs are not only influenced by external forces, but also by internal influences that we
control. Like our behavior, our attitudes and thoughts are not always changed by situational pressures, but they
can be consciously changed by our own free will. In this section we discuss the conditions under which we
would want to change our own attitudes and beliefs.
What is Cognitive Dissonance?
Social psychologists have documented that feeling good about ourselves and maintaining positive self-esteem
is a powerful motivator of human behavior (Tavris & Aronson, 2008). In the United States, members of the
predominant culture typically think very highly of themselves and view themselves as good people who are
above average on many desirable traits (Ehrlinger, Gilovich, & Ross, 2005). Often, our behavior, attitudes, and

Summary
12.1 What Is Social Psychology?
Social psychology is the subfield of psychology that studies the power of the situation to influence individuals’
thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Psychologists categorize the causes of human behavior as those due to
internal factors, such as personality, or those due to external factors, such as cultural and other social
influences. Behavior is better explained, however, by using both approaches. Lay people tend to over-rely on
dispositional explanations for behavior and ignore the power of situational influences, a perspective called the
fundamental attribution error. People from individualistic cultures are more likely to display this bias versus
people from collectivistic cultures. Our explanations for our own and others behaviors can be biased due to not
having enough information about others’ motivations for behaviors and by providing explanations that bolster
our self-esteem.
12.2 Self-presentation
Human behavior is largely influenced by our social roles, norms, and scripts. In order to know how to act in a
given situation, we have shared cultural knowledge of how to behave depending on our role in society. Social
norms dictate the behavior that is appropriate or inappropriate for each role. Each social role has scripts that
help humans learn the sequence of appropriate behaviors in a given setting. The famous Stanford prison
experiment is an example of how the power of the situation can dictate the social roles, norms, and scripts we
follow in a given situation, even if this behavior is contrary to our typical behavior.
12.3 Attitudes and Persuasion
Attitudes are our evaluations or feelings toward a person, idea, or object and typically are positive or negative.
Our attitudes and beliefs are influenced not only by external forces, but also by internal influences that we
control. An internal form of attitude change is cognitive dissonance or the tension we experience when our
thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are in conflict. In order to reduce dissonance, individuals can change their
behavior, attitudes, or cognitions, or add a new cognition. External forces of persuasion include advertising;
the features of advertising that influence our behaviors include the source, message, and audience. There are
two primary routes to persuasion. The central route to persuasion uses facts and information to persuade
potential consumers. The peripheral route uses positive association with cues such as beauty, fame, and
positive emotions.
12.4 Conformity, Compliance, and Obedience
The power of the situation can lead people to conform, or go along with the group, even in the face of
inaccurate information. Conformity to group norms is driven by two motivations, the desire to fit in and be
liked and the desire to be accurate and gain information from the group. Authority figures also have influence
over our behaviors, and many people become obedient and follow orders even if the orders are contrary to
their personal values. Conformity to group pressures can also result in groupthink, or the faulty decision-
making process that results from cohesive group members trying to maintain group harmony. Group
situations can improve human behavior through facilitating performance on easy tasks, but inhibiting
performance on difficult tasks. The presence of others can also lead to social loafing when individual efforts
cannot be evaluated.
12.5 Prejudice and Discrimination
As diverse individuals, humans can experience conflict when interacting with people who are different from
each other. Prejudice, or negative feelings and evaluations, is common when people are from a different social
group (i.e., out-group). Negative attitudes toward out-groups can lead to discrimination. Prejudice and
discrimination against others can be based on gender, race, ethnicity, social class, sexual orientation, or a
variety of other social identities. In-group’s who feel threatened may blame the out-groups for their plight, thus
using the out-group as a scapegoat for their frustration.
12 • Summary 439
12.6 Aggression
Aggression is seeking to cause another person harm or pain. Hostile aggression is motivated by feelings of
anger with intent to cause pain, and instrumental aggression is motivated by achieving a goal and does not
necessarily involve intent to cause pain Bullying is an international public health concern that largely affects
the adolescent population. Bullying is repeated behaviors that are intended to inflict harm on the victim and
can take the form of physical, psychological, emotional, or social abuse. Bullying has negative mental health
consequences for youth including suicide. Cyberbullying is a newer form of bullying that takes place in an
online environment where bullies can remain anonymous and victims are helpless to address the harassment.
Despite the social norm of helping others in need, when there are many bystanders witnessing an emergency,
diffusion of responsibility will lead to a lower likelihood of any one person helping.
12.7 Prosocial Behavior
Altruism is a pure form of helping others out of empathy, which can be contrasted with egoistic motivations for
helping. Forming relationships with others is a necessity for social beings. We typically form relationships with
people who are close to us in proximity and people with whom we share similarities. We expect reciprocity and
self-disclosure in our relationships. We also want to form relationships with people who are physically
attractive, though standards for attractiveness vary by culture and gender. There are many types of love that
are determined by various combinations of intimacy, passion, and commitment; consummate love, which is
the ideal form of love, contains all three components. When determining satisfaction and whether to maintain
a relationship, individuals often use a social exchange approach and weigh the costs and benefits of forming
and maintaining a relationship.

","Answer VERY concisely from the provided context only. Your answer length: less or equal 150 tokens. Plain text, no Markdown. Answer only, no other questions. Context: equally likely to give dispositional and external explanations. This supports the idea that actors tend to provide few internal explanations but many situational explanations for their own behavior. In contrast, observers tend to provide more dispositional explanations for a friend’s behavior (Figure 12.5). FIGURE 12.5 Actor-observer bias is evident when subjects explain their own reasons for liking a girlfriend versus their impressions of others’ reasons for liking a girlfriend. Self-Serving Bias We can understand self-serving bias by digging more deeply into attribution, a belief about the cause of a result. One model of attribution proposes three main dimensions: locus of control (internal versus external), stability (stable versus unstable), and controllability (controllable versus uncontrollable). In this context, stability refers to the extent in which the circumstances that result in a given outcome are changeable. The circumstances are considered stable if they are unlikely to change. Controllability refers to the extent to which the circumstances that are associated with a given outcome can be controlled. Obviously, those things that we have the power to control would be labeled controllable (Weiner, 1979). Following an outcome, self-serving biases are those attributions that enable us to see ourselves in a favorable light (for example, making internal attributions for success and external attributions for failures). When you do well at a task, for example acing an exam, it is in your best interest to make a dispositional attribution for your behavior (“I’m smart,”) instead of a situational one (“The exam was easy,”). Self-serving bias is the tendency to explain our successes as due to dispositional (internal) characteristics, but to explain our failures as due to situational (external) factors. Again, this is culture dependent. This bias serves to protect self-esteem. You can imagine that if people always made situational attributions for their behavior, they would never be able to take credit and feel good about their accomplishments. Consider the example of how we explain our favorite sports team’s wins. Research shows that we make internal, stable, and controllable attributions for our team’s victory (Figure 12.6) (Grove, Hanushek, & Krueger, 2001). For example: “I know my team is better than the other team because they have won more games than me,” or “My team has won because I am a better player than them.” These are all examples of internal attributions. However, we also make external, unstable, uncontrollably attributing the victory to external factors, such as the weather or luck. For instance, “It was a great game because it was sunny and I was in the right place at the right time.” This is an external attribution because we can’t change the outcome of the game. We can’t control whether it’s sunny or not, nor can we change our position or time of day. These external and unstable attribution are the ones that make us feel like we are better at our sport than we really are. They also make us believe that other people are not as good at their sport as they think. So, if you are a basketball player and you win a game, you will feel better about yourself than you would if someone else won the same game. That’s why we feel so good when we do well at something, even if we don’t deserve to be so happy. However, there is a problem with this internal attribution. If you think that your team wins because you are the best player on the team, then you won’t be as happy about your own performance as you might be if you thought that you were the only one who could win. Therefore, the attribution you give yourself is not consistent with your actual performance, which is what we want to know. It is important to keep in mind that attribution is just one of many factors that influence our self-perception. Other factors include self-efficacy, self-esteem, social support, life satisfaction, etc. But attribution plays a very important role in our perception of ourselves and our ability to perform well in various situations. In the next section we will look at another type of bias, called self-fulfilling prophecies, that can occur when people attribute their successes or failures to internal or external factors, rather than to their personal characteristics or abilities. (For more information on this topic, see Chapter 7.) Self-Reported Attribution Attribution is also an important aspect of self-awareness. Self-reporting is defined as “the process of reporting one’s own thoughts, feelings, or","{""sections"": [""Social Psychology/Conformity, Compliance, and Obedience"", ""Industrial-Organizational Psychology/What Is Industrial and Organizational Psychology?""], ""pages"": [""418"", ""419"", ""453""]}"

Clive Wearing is an accomplished musician who lost his ability to form new memories when
he became sick at the age of 46. While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember
what he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is
associated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend’s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John
Nash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would
tell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended
for him. He also began to hear voices and became suspicious of the people around him. Soon thereafter, Nash
was diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a state-run mental institution (O’Connor & Robertson,
1Introduction to Psychology
2002). Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these
experiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain’s internal
processes and people’s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of
psychology has explored these questions.
1.1 What Is Psychology?
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Define psychology
• Understand the merits of an education in psychology
What is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology
explores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists
use the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question
about how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the
phenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or
group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over
time. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes
observations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then
published or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.
Scientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because
it is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We
must ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However,
we can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus,
psychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.
In general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot
arrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the
mind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific
method is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on
observation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or
previous authorities.
It was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this
time, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is,
at its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological
organism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore,
psychology is also a social science.
WHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?
Often, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to
learn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course
because it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as
nursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare
psychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses
across the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology
majors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook’s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality
and political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About
6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S.
Department of Education, 2016).

An education in psychology is valuable for a number of reasons. Psychology students hone critical thinking
skills and are trained in the use of the scientific method. Critical thinking is the active application of a set of
skills to information for the understanding and evaluation of that information. The evaluation of
information—assessing its reliability and usefulness— is an important skill in a world full of competing “facts,”
many of which are designed to be misleading. For example, critical thinking involves maintaining an attitude
of skepticism, recognizing internal biases, making use of logical thinking, asking appropriate questions, and
making observations. Psychology students also can develop better communication skills during the course of
their undergraduate coursework (American Psychological Association, 2011). Together, these factors increase
students’ scientific literacy and prepare students to critically evaluate the various sources of information they
encounter.
In addition to these broad-based skills, psychology students come to understand the complex factors that
shape one’s behavior. They appreciate the interaction of our biology, our environment, and our experiences in
determining who we are and how we will behave. They learn about basic principles that guide how we think
and behave, and they come to recognize the tremendous diversity that exists across individuals and across
cultural boundaries (American Psychological Association, 2011).

1.2 History of Psychology
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Understand the importance of Wundt and James in the development of psychology
• Appreciate Freud’s influence on psychology
• Understand the basic tenets of Gestalt psychology
• Appreciate the important role that behaviorism played in psychology’s history
• Understand basic tenets of humanism
• Understand how the cognitive revolution shifted psychology’s focus back to the mind
Psychology is a relatively young science with its experimental roots in the 19th century, compared, for
example, to human physiology, which dates much earlier. As mentioned, anyone interested in exploring issues
related to the mind generally did so in a philosophical context prior to the 19th century. Two 19th century
scholars, Wilhelm Wundt and William James, are generally credited as being the founders of psychology as a
science and academic discipline that was distinct from philosophy. This section will provide an overview of the
shifts in paradigms that have influenced psychology from Wundt and James through today.
Wundt and Structuralism
Wilhelm Wundt (1832–1920) was a German scientist who was the first person to be referred to as a
psychologist. His famous book entitled Principles of Physiological Psychology was published in 1873. Wundt
viewed psychology as a scientific study of conscious experience, and he believed that the goal of psychology
was to identify components of consciousness and how those components combined to result in our conscious
experience. Wundt used introspection (he called it “internal perception”), a process by which someone
examines their own conscious experience as objectively as possible, making the human mind like any other
aspect of nature that a scientist observed. He believed in the notion of voluntarism—that people have free will
and should know the intentions of a psychological experiment if they were participating (Danziger, 1980).
Wundt considered his version experimental introspection; he used instruments such as those that measured
reaction time. He also wrote Volkerpsychologie in 1904 in which he suggested that psychology should include
the study of culture, as it involves the study of people. Edward Titchener, one of his students, went on to
1.2 • History of Psychology 9
develop structuralism. Its focus was on the contents of mental processes rather than their function (Pickren &
Rutherford, 2010). Wundt established his psychology laboratory at the University at Leipzig in 1879 (Figure
1.2). In this laboratory, Wundt and his students conducted experiments on, for example, reaction times. A
subject, sometimes in a room isolated from the scientist, would receive a stimulus such as a light, image, or
sound. The subject’s reaction to the stimulus would be to push a button, and an apparatus would record the
time to reaction. Wundt could measure reaction time to one-thousandth of a second (Nicolas & Ferrand, 1999).
FIGURE 1.2 (a) Wilhelm Wundt is credited as one of the founders of psychology. He created the first laboratory for
psychological research. (b) This photo shows him seated and surrounded by fellow researchers and equipment in
his laboratory in Germany.
However, despite his efforts to train individuals in the process of introspection, this process remained highly
subjective, and there was very little agreement between individuals.
Functionalism
William James, John Dewey, and Charles Sanders Peirce helped establish functional psychology (Figure 1.3).
They accepted Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection and viewed this theory as an explanation of an
organism’s characteristics. Key to that theory is the idea that natural selection leads to organisms that are
adapted to their environment, including their behavior. Adaptation means that a trait of an organism has a
function for the survival and reproduction of the individual, because it has been naturally selected. As James
saw it, psychology’s purpose was to study the function of behavior in the world, and as such, his perspective
was known as functionalism. Functionalism focused on how mental activities helped an organism fit into its
environment. Functionalism has a second, more subtle meaning in that functionalists were more interested in
the operation of the whole mind rather than of its individual parts, which were the focus of structuralism. Like
Wundt, James believed that introspection could serve as one means by which someone might study mental
activities, but James also relied on more objective measures, including the use of various recording devices,
and examinations of concrete products of mental activities and of anatomy and physiology (Gordon, 1995).

those with different political ideals. Remarkably, political polarization leads to open levels of discrimination
that are on par with, or perhaps exceed, racial discrimination (Iyengar & Westwood, 2015). A more everyday
example is a group’s discussion of how attractive someone is. Does your opinion change if you find someone
attractive, but your friends do not agree? If your friends vociferously agree, might you then find this person
even more attractive?
Social traps refer to situations that arise when individuals or groups of individuals behave in ways that are not
in their best interest and that may have negative, long-term consequences. However, once established, a social
trap is very difficult to escape. For example, following World War II, the United States and the former Soviet
Union engaged in a nuclear arms race. While the presence of nuclear weapons is not in either party's best
interest, once the arms race began, each country felt the need to continue producing nuclear weapons to
protect itself from the other.
Social Loafing
Imagine you were just assigned a group project with other students whom you barely know. Everyone in your
group will get the same grade. Are you the type who will do most of the work, even though the final grade will
be shared? Or are you more likely to do less work because you know others will pick up the slack? Social
loafing involves a reduction in individual output on tasks where contributions are pooled. Because each
individual's efforts are not evaluated, individuals can become less motivated to perform well. Karau and
Williams (1993) and Simms and Nichols (2014) reviewed the research on social loafing and discerned when it
was least likely to happen. The researchers noted that social loafing could be alleviated if, among other
situations, individuals knew their work would be assessed by a manager (in a workplace setting) or instructor
(in a classroom setting), or if a manager or instructor required group members to complete self-evaluations.
The likelihood of social loafing in student work groups increases as the size of the group increases (Shepperd &
Taylor, 1999). According to Kamau and Williams (1993), college students were the population most likely to
engage in social loafing. Their study also found that women and participants from collectivistic cultures were
less likely to engage in social loafing, explaining that their group orientation may account for this.
College students could work around social loafing or “free-riding” by suggesting to their professors use of a
flocking method to form groups. Harding (2018) compared groups of students who had self-selected into
groups for class to those who had been formed by flocking, which involves assigning students to groups who
have similar schedules and motivations. Not only did she find that students reported less “free riding,” but that
they also did better in the group assignments compared to those whose groups were self-selected.
Interestingly, the opposite of social loafing occurs when the task is complex and difficult (Bond & Titus, 1983;
Geen, 1989). In a group setting, such as the student work group, if your individual performance cannot be
evaluated, there is less pressure for you to do well, and thus less anxiety or physiological arousal (Latané,
Williams, & Harkens, 1979). This puts you in a relaxed state in which you can perform your best, if you choose
(Zajonc, 1965). If the task is a difficult one, many people feel motivated and believe that their group needs their
input to do well on a challenging project (Jackson & Williams, 1985).
Deindividuation
Another way that being part of a group can affect behavior is exhibited in instances in which deindividuation
occurs. Deindividuation refers to situations in which a person may feel a sense of anonymity and therefore a
reduction in accountability and sense of self when among others. Deindividuation is often pointed to in cases
in which mob or riot-like behaviors occur (Zimbardo, 1969), but research on the subject and the role that
deindividuation plays in such behaviors has resulted in inconsistent results (as discussed in Granström, Guvå,
Hylander, & Rosander, 2009).

12.5 Prejudice and Discrimination
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Define and distinguish among prejudice, stereotypes, and discrimination
• Provide examples of prejudice, stereotypes, and discrimination
• Explain why prejudice and discrimination exist
Human conflict can result in crime, war, and mass murder, such as genocide. Prejudice and discrimination
often are root causes of human conflict, which explains how strangers come to hate one another to the extreme
of causing others harm. Prejudice and discrimination affect everyone. In this section we will examine the
definitions of prejudice and discrimination, examples of these concepts, and causes of these biases.

Understanding Prejudice and Discrimination
As we discussed in the opening story of Trayvon Martin, humans are very diverse and although we share many
similarities, we also have many differences. The social groups we belong to help form our identities (Tajfel,
1974). These differences may be difficult for some people to reconcile, which may lead to prejudice toward
people who are different. Prejudice is a negative attitude and feeling toward an individual based solely on
one’s membership in a particular social group (Allport, 1954; Brown, 2010). Prejudice is common against
people who are members of an unfamiliar cultural group. Thus, certain types of education, contact,
interactions, and building relationships with members of different cultural groups can reduce the tendency
toward prejudice. In fact, simply imagining interacting with members of different cultural groups might affect
prejudice. Indeed, when experimental participants were asked to imagine themselves positively interacting
with someone from a different group, this led to an increased positive attitude toward the other group and an
increase in positive traits associated with the other group. Furthermore, imagined social interaction can
reduce anxiety associated with inter-group interactions (Crisp & Turner, 2009). What are some examples of
social groups that you belong to that contribute to your identity? Social groups can include gender, race,
ethnicity, nationality, social class, religion, sexual orientation, profession, and many more. And, as is true for
social roles, you can simultaneously be a member of more than one social group. An example of prejudice is
having a negative attitude toward people who are not born in the United States. Although people holding this
prejudiced attitude do not know all people who were not born in the United States, they dislike them due to
their status as foreigners.
Can you think of a prejudiced attitude you have held toward a group of people? How did your prejudice
develop? Prejudice often begins in the form of a stereotype—that is, a specific belief or assumption about
individuals based solely on their membership in a group, regardless of their individual characteristics.
Stereotypes become overgeneralized and applied to all members of a group. For example, someone holding
prejudiced attitudes toward older adults, may believe that older adults are slow and incompetent (Cuddy,
Norton, & Fiske, 2005; Nelson, 2004). We cannot possibly know each individual person of advanced age to
know that all older adults are slow and incompetent. Therefore, this negative belief is overgeneralized to all
members of the group, even though many of the individual group members may in fact be spry and intelligent.
Another example of a well-known stereotype involves beliefs about racial differences among athletes. As
Hodge, Burden, Robinson, and Bennett (2008) point out, Black athletes are often believed to be more athletic,
yet less intelligent, than their White counterparts. These beliefs persist despite a number of high profile
examples to the contrary. Sadly, such beliefs often influence how these athletes are treated by others and how
they view themselves and their own capabilities. Whether or not you agree with a stereotype, stereotypes are
generally well-known within a given culture (Devine, 1989).
Sometimes people will act on their prejudiced attitudes toward a group of people, and this behavior is known
as discrimination. Discrimination is negative action toward an individual as a result of one’s membership in a
particular group (Allport, 1954; Dovidio & Gaertner, 2004). As a result of holding negative beliefs (stereotypes)
and negative attitudes (prejudice) about a particular group, people often treat the target of prejudice poorly,
such as excluding older adults from their circle of friends. In this way, discrimination is a form of oppression.
An example of a psychologist experiencing gender discrimination is found in the life and studies of Mary
Whiton Calkins. Calkins was given special permission to attend graduate seminars at Harvard (at that time in
the late 1880s, Harvard did not accept women) and at one point was the sole student of the famous
psychologist William James. She passed all the requirements needed for a PhD and was described by
psychologist Hugo Münsterberg as “one of the strongest professors of psychology in this country.” However,
Harvard refused to grant Calkins a PhD because she was a woman (Harvard University, 2019). Table 12.3

summarizes the characteristics of stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination. Have you ever been the target of
discrimination? If so, how did this negative treatment make you feel?

TABLE 12.3
So far, we’ve discussed stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination as negative thoughts, feelings, and
behaviors because these are typically the most problematic. However, it is important to also point out that
people can hold positive thoughts, feelings, and behaviors toward individuals based on group membership; for
example, they would show preferential treatment for people who are like themselves—that is, who share the
same gender, race, or favorite sports team.
LINK T O LEARNING
Watch this video of a social experiment conducted in a park (http://openstax.org/l/racismexp) that
demonstrates the concepts of prejudice, stereotypes, and discrimination. In the video, three people try to steal
a bike out in the open. The race and gender of the thief is varied: a White male teenager, a Black male teenager,
and a White female. Does anyone try to stop them? The treatment of the teenagers in the video demonstrates
the concept of racism.
Prejudice and Discrimination
When we meet strangers we automatically process three pieces of information about them: their race, gender,
and age (Ito & Urland, 2003). Why are these aspects of an unfamiliar person so important? Why don’t we
instead notice whether their eyes are friendly, whether they are smiling, their height, the type of clothes they
are wearing? Although these secondary characteristics are important in forming a first impression of a
stranger, the social categories of race, gender, and age provide a wealth of information about an individual.
This information, however, often is based on stereotypes. We may have different expectations of strangers
depending on their race, gender, and age. What stereotypes and prejudices do you hold about people who are
from a race, gender, and age group different from your own?
Racism
Racism is prejudice and discrimination against an individual based solely on one’s membership in a specific
racial group (such as toward African Americans, Asian Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, European
Americans). What are some stereotypes of various racial or ethnic groups? Research suggests cultural
stereotypes for Asian Americans include cold, sly, and intelligent; for Latinos, cold and unintelligent; for
424 12 • Social Psychology
Access for free at openstax.org
European Americans, cold and intelligent; and for African Americans, aggressive, athletic, and more likely to
be law breakers (Devine & Elliot, 1995; Fiske, Cuddy, Glick, & Xu, 2002; Sommers & Ellsworth, 2000; Dixon &
Linz, 2000).
Racism exists for many racial and ethnic groups. For example, Black people are significantly more likely to
have their vehicles searched during traffic stops than White people, particularly when Black people are driving
in predominately White neighborhoods, a phenomenon often termed “DWB” or “driving while Black” (Rojek,
Rosenfeld, & Decker, 2012).
Mexican Americans and other Latino groups also are targets of racism from the police and other members of
the community. For example, when purchasing items with a personal check, Latino shoppers are more likely
than White shoppers to be asked to show formal identification (Dovidio et al., 2010).
In one case of alleged harassment by the police, several East Haven, Connecticut, police officers were arrested
on federal charges due to reportedly continued harassment and brutalization of Latinos. When the accusations
came out, the mayor of East Haven was asked, “What are you doing for the Latino community today?” The
Mayor responded, “I might have tacos when I go home, I’m not quite sure yet” (“East Haven Mayor,” 2012). This
statement undermines the important issue of racial profiling and police harassment of Latinos, while belittling
Latino culture by emphasizing an interest in a food product stereotypically associated with Latinos.
Racism is prevalent toward many other groups in the United States including Native Americans, Arab
Americans, Jewish Americans, and Asian Americans. Have you experienced or witnessed racism toward any of
these racial or ethnic groups? Are you aware of racism in your community?
One reason modern forms of racism, and prejudice in general, are hard to detect is related to the dual attitudes
model (Wilson, Lindsey, & Schooler, 2000). Humans have two forms of attitudes: explicit attitudes, which are
conscious and controllable, and implicit attitudes, which are unconscious and uncontrollable (Devine, 1989;
Olson & Fazio, 2003). Because holding egalitarian views is socially desirable (Plant & Devine, 1998), most
people do not show extreme racial bias or other prejudices on measures of their explicit attitudes. However,
measures of implicit attitudes often show evidence of mild to strong racial bias or other prejudices (Greenwald,
McGee, & Schwartz, 1998; Olson & Fazio, 2003).
Sexism
Sexism is prejudice and discrimination toward individuals based on their sex. Typically, sexism takes the form
of men holding biases against women, but anyone can show sexism toward their own or the other sex. Like
racism, sexism may be subtle and difficult to detect. Common forms of sexism in modern society include
gender role expectations, such as expecting women to be the caretakers of the household. Sexism also includes
people’s expectations for how members of a gender group should behave. For example, women are expected to
be friendly, passive, and nurturing, and when women behave in an unfriendly, assertive, or neglectful manner
they often are disliked for violating their gender role (Rudman, 1998). Research by Laurie Rudman (1998) finds
that when female job applicants self-promote, they are likely to be viewed as competent, but they may be
disliked and are less likely to be hired because they violated gender expectations for modesty. In this way,
women are sometimes blamed for wage and employment inequality, but they would be viewed negatively for
trying to overcome them, a phenomenon sometimes referred to as the double bind. Sexism can exist on a
societal level such as in hiring, employment opportunities, and education. Women are less likely to be hired or
promoted in male-dominated professions such as engineering, aviation, and construction (Figure 12.22) (Blau,
Ferber, & Winkler, 2010; Ceci & Williams, 2011). Have you ever experienced or witnessed sexism? Think about
your family members’ jobs or careers. Why do you think there are differences in the jobs women and men
have, such as more women nurses but more male surgeons (Betz, 2008)?
12.5 • Prejudice and Discrimination 425
FIGURE 12.22 Women now have many jobs previously closed to them, though they still face challenges in men-
dominated occupations. (credit: ""The National Guard""/Flickr)
Ageism
People often form judgments and hold expectations about people based on their age. These judgments and
expectations can lead to ageism, or prejudice and discrimination toward individuals based solely on their age.
Think of expectations you hold for older adults. How could someone’s expectations influence the feelings they
hold toward individuals from older age groups? Ageism is widespread in U.S. culture (Nosek, 2005), and a
common ageist attitude toward older adults is that they are incompetent, physically weak, and slow
(Greenberg, Schimel, & Martens, 2002) and some people consider older adults less attractive. Chang, Kannoth,
Levy, Wang, Lee, and Levy (2020) reported on relationships between ageism and health outcomes over a
40-year-plus period from countries around the world. Across 11 health domains, people over 50 were likely to
experience ageism most often in the form of being denied access to health services and work opportunities.
Some cultures, however, including some Asian, Latino, and African American cultures, both outside and within
the United States afford older adults respect and honor.
Typically, ageism occurs against older adults, but ageism also can occur toward younger adults. What
expectations do you hold toward younger people? Does society expect younger adults to be immature and
irresponsible? Are younger generations seen as having it too easy or having weaker characters than older
generations? Raymer, Reed, Spiegel, and Purvanova (2017) examined ageism against younger workers. They
found that older workers endorsed negative stereotypes of younger workers, believing that they had more work
deficit characteristics (including perceptions of incompetence). How might these forms of ageism affect a
younger and older adult who are applying for a sales clerk position?
Homophobia and Transphobia
Another form of prejudice is homophobia: an umbrella term referring to prejudice and discrimination of
individuals based solely on their sexual orientation, which is often applied to bisexual, lesbian, gay, and other
non-heterosexual people. Transphobia is the hatred or fear of those who are perceived to break or blur
stereotypical gender roles, often expressed as stereotyping, discrimination, harassment and/or violence. Like
ageism, homophobia is a widespread prejudice in U.S. society that is tolerated by many people (Herek &
McLemore, 2013; Nosek, 2005). Negative feelings often result in discrimination, such as the exclusion of
lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) people from social groups and the avoidance of
LGBTQ+ neighbors and co-workers. This discrimination also extends to employers deliberately declining to
hire qualified LGBTQ+ job applicants, a practice officially outlawed by a 2020 Surpreme Court decision but
which remains a significant issue. Have you experienced or witnessed homophobia? If so, what stereotypes,
prejudiced attitudes, and discrimination were evident?

While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember what he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is associated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend’s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John Nash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would tell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended for him. He also began to hear voices in his head that he could not control. When he tried to stop them, they would come back to him, and when he did not want them to, the voices would leave him (Wearing, n.d.). These are just a few of the many examples of how people experience the world around them in ways that are unpredictable and difficult to understand. In this chapter, we will explore what psychology is, what it is not, and how it has evolved over time. We will also look at some common misconceptions about psychology. Finally, we will discuss some careers in psychology and the role that psychology plays in our lives. 2. WHAT IS PSYCHOLOGY? The word “psychology” comes from two Greek words, “psyche” and “logos,” which mean “mind” or “thinking.” Psychologists are interested in how the mind works and how we think and feel. They study the mental processes that occur in the brain, such as perception, attention, memory, thinking, problem solving, emotion, motivation, learning, decision making, self-regulation, personality, social behavior, etc. Psychologists use a variety of methods to study these processes, including observation, experiments, surveys, interviews, questionnaires, brain imaging, neuropsychology, cognitive neuroscience, psychometrics, clinical psychology, developmental psychology, ethnopsychology and social psychology. Psychology has a long and rich history. It has been practiced for thousands of years in many different cultures and societies. For example, in ancient Greece, Plato and Aristotle studied psychology in order to understand the nature of human beings and their relationships with each other and with their environment. In the Middle Ages, Christian theologians and philosophers used psychology as a tool for understanding the nature of God and his relationship with his creatures. During the Renaissance, scientists and thinkers such as Galileo Galilei, Isaac Newton, René Descartes, John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Auguste Comte, Jean-Paul Sartre, Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, William James, Edward Thorndike, B.F. Skinner and others developed theories of psychology that continue to shape our understanding of this field today. Today, psychology is a broad and diverse field that encompasses a wide range of subfields and disciplines. Some of these disciplines include: • Clinical psychology: This field focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders, as well as","{""sections"": [""Social Psychology/Prosocial Behavior"", ""Introduction to Psychology/Contemporary Psychology""], ""pages"": [""435"", ""436"", ""20""]}"

Carl Rogers (1902–1987) was also an American psychologist who, like Maslow, emphasized the potential for
good that exists within all people (Figure 1.8). Rogers used a therapeutic technique known as client-centered
therapy in helping his clients deal with problematic issues that resulted in their seeking psychotherapy. Unlike
a psychoanalytic approach in which the therapist plays an important role in interpreting what conscious
behavior reveals about the unconscious mind, client-centered therapy involves the patient taking a lead role in
the therapy session. Rogers believed that a therapist needed to display three features to maximize the
effectiveness of this particular approach: unconditional positive regard, genuineness, and empathy.
Unconditional positive regard refers to the fact that the therapist accepts their client for who they are, no
matter what they might say. Provided these factors, Rogers believed that people were more than capable of
dealing with and working through their own issues (Thorne & Henley, 2005).

Humanism has been influential to psychology as a whole. Both Maslow and Rogers are well-known names
among students of psychology (you will read more about both later in this text), and their ideas have influenced
many scholars. Furthermore, Rogers’ client-centered approach to therapy is still commonly used in
psychotherapeutic settings today (O’hara, n.d.)

The Cognitive Revolution
Behaviorism’s emphasis on objectivity and focus on external behavior had pulled psychologists’ attention away
from the mind for a prolonged period of time. The early work of the humanistic psychologists redirected
attention to the individual human as a whole, and as a conscious and self-aware being. By the 1950s, new
disciplinary perspectives in linguistics, neuroscience, and computer science were emerging, and these areas
revived interest in the mind as a focus of scientific inquiry. This particular perspective has come to be known
as the cognitive revolution (Miller, 2003). By 1967, Ulric Neisser published the first textbook entitled Cognitive
Psychology, which served as a core text in cognitive psychology courses around the country (Thorne & Henley,
2005).
Although no one person is entirely responsible for starting the cognitive revolution, Noam Chomsky was very
influential in the early days of this movement (Figure 1.9). Chomsky (1928–), an American linguist, was
dissatisfied with the influence that behaviorism had had on psychology. He believed that psychology’s focus on
behavior was short-sighted and that the field had to re-incorporate mental functioning into its purview if it
were to offer any meaningful contributions to understanding behavior (Miller, 2003).
FIGURE 1.9 Noam Chomsky was very influential in beginning the cognitive revolution. In 2010, this mural honoring
him was put up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (credit: Robert Moran)
European psychology had never really been as influenced by behaviorism as had American psychology; and
thus, the cognitive revolution helped reestablish lines of communication between European psychologists and
their American counterparts. Furthermore, psychologists began to cooperate with scientists in other fields,
like anthropology, linguistics, computer science, and neuroscience, among others. This interdisciplinary
approach often was referred to as the cognitive sciences, and the influence and prominence of this particular
perspective resonates in modern-day psychology (Miller, 2003).
Feminist Psychology
The science of psychology has had an impact on human wellbeing, both positive and negative. The dominant
influence of Western, White, and male academics in the early history of psychology meant that psychology
developed with the biases inherent in those individuals, which often had negative consequences for members of
society who were not White or male. Women, members of ethnic minorities in both the United States and other
countries, and individuals with sexual orientations other than straight had difficulties entering the field of
psychology and therefore influencing its development. They also suffered from the attitudes of White male
psychologists who were not immune to the nonscientific attitudes prevalent in the society in which they

developed and worked. Until the 1960s, the science of psychology was largely a “womanless” psychology
(Crawford & Marecek, 1989), meaning that few women were able to practice psychology, so they had little
influence on what was studied. In addition, the experimental subjects of psychology were mostly men, which
resulted from underlying assumptions that gender had no influence on psychology and that women were not of
sufficient interest to study.
An article by Naomi Weisstein, first published in 1968 (Weisstein, 1993), stimulated a feminist revolution in
psychology by presenting a critique of psychology as a science. She also specifically criticized male psychologists
for constructing the psychology of women entirely out of their own cultural biases and without careful
experimental tests to verify any of their characterizations of women. Weisstein used, as examples, statements by
prominent psychologists in the 1960s, such as this quote by Bruno Bettleheim: “We must start with the
realization that, as much as women want to be good scientists or engineers, they want first and foremost to be
womanly companions of men and to be mothers.” Weisstein’s critique formed the foundation for the subsequent
development of a feminist psychology that attempted to be free of the influence of male cultural biases on our
knowledge of the psychology of women.
Crawford & Marecek (1989) identify several feminist approaches to psychology that can be described as feminist
psychology. These include re-evaluating and discovering the contributions of women to the history of psychology,
studying psychological gender differences, and questioning the male bias present across the practice of the
scientific approach to knowledge.
Multicultural And Cross-Cultural Psychology
Culture impacts individuals, groups, and society. An ongoing issue researchers are trying to correct is that
certain populations have been over-studied and the results of these studies have been applied to other
populations. For example, Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan discuss how WEIRD societies have been
overstudied and the results have been wrongly applied to non-WEIRD societies (2010). WEIRD stands for
western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic. Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan found that there are
many differences between people in the WEIRD group and people in less industrialized, less urban, and non-
Western societies. These differences occur in a variety of areas, including perception, cooperation, and moral
reasoning. That is, people vary depending on their culture and environment. Multicultural psychologists
develop theories and conduct research with diverse populations, typically within one country. Cross-cultural
psychologists compare populations across countries, such as participants from the United States compared to
participants from China.
In 1920, Francis Cecil Sumner was the first African American to receive a PhD in psychology in the United
States. Sumner established a psychology degree program at Howard University, leading to the education of a
new generation of African American psychologists (Black, Spence, and Omari, 2004). Much of the work of early
psychologists from diverse backgrounds was dedicated to challenging intelligence testing and promoting
innovative educational methods for children. George I. Sanchez contested such testing with Mexican American
children. As a psychologist of Mexican heritage, he pointed out that the language and cultural barriers in
testing were keeping children from equal opportunities (Guthrie, 1998). By 1940, he was teaching with his
doctoral degree at University of Texas at Austin and challenging segregated educational practices (Romo,
1986).
Two famous African American researchers and psychologists are Mamie Phipps Clark and her husband,
Kenneth Clark. They are best known for their studies conducted on African American children and doll
preference, research that was instrumental in the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court desegregation
case. The Clarks applied their research to social services and opened the first child guidance center in Harlem
(American Psychological Association, 2019).

The American Psychological Association has several ethnically based organizations for professional
psychologists that facilitate interactions among members. Since psychologists belonging to specific ethnic
groups or cultures have the most interest in studying the psychology of their communities, these organizations
provide an opportunity for the growth of research on the interplay between culture and psychology.
WOMEN IN PSYCHOLOGY
Although rarely given credit, women have been contributing to psychology since its inception as a field of
study. In 1894, Margaret Floy Washburn was the first woman awarded the doctoral degree in psychology. She
wrote The Animal Mind: A Textbook of Comparative Psychology, and it was the standard in the field for over 20
years. In the mid 1890s, Mary Whiton Calkins completed all requirements toward the PhD in psychology, but
Harvard University refused to award her that degree because she was a woman. She had been taught and
mentored by William James, who tried and failed to convince Harvard to award her the doctoral degree. Her
memory research studied primacy and recency (Madigan & O’Hara, 1992), and she also wrote about how
structuralism and functionalism both explained self-psychology (Calkins, 1906).
Another influential woman, Mary Cover Jones, conducted a study she considered to be a sequel to John B.
Watson’s study of Little Albert (you’ll learn about this study in the chapter on Learning). Jones unconditioned
fear in Little Peter, who had been afraid of rabbits (Jones, 1924).
Ethnic minority women contributing to the field of psychology include Martha Bernal and Inez Beverly Prosser;
their studies were related to education. Bernal, the first Latina to earn her doctoral degree in psychology
(1962) conducted much of her research with Mexican American children. Prosser was the first African
American woman awarded the PhD in 1933 at the University of Cincinnati (Benjamin, Henry, & McMahon,
2005).
1.3 Contemporary Psychology
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Appreciate the diversity of interests and foci within psychology
• Understand basic interests and applications in each of the described areas of psychology
• Demonstrate familiarity with some of the major concepts or important figures in each of the described areas of
psychology
Contemporary psychology is a diverse field that is influenced by all of the historical perspectives described in
the preceding section. Reflective of the discipline’s diversity is the diversity seen within the American
Psychological Association (APA). The APA is a professional organization representing psychologists in the
United States. The APA is the largest organization of psychologists in the world, and its mission is to advance
and disseminate psychological knowledge for the betterment of people. There are 54 divisions within the APA,
representing a wide variety of specialties that range from Societies for the Psychology of Religion and
Spirituality to Exercise and Sport Psychology to Behavioral Neuroscience and Comparative Psychology.
Reflecting the diversity of the field of psychology itself, members, affiliate members, and associate members
span the spectrum from students to doctoral-level psychologists, and come from a variety of places including
educational settings, criminal justice, hospitals, the armed forces, and industry (American Psychological
Association, 2014). G. Stanley Hall was the first president of the APA. Before he earned his doctoral degree, he
was an adjunct instructor at Wilberforce University, a historically Black college/university (HBCU), while
serving as faculty at Antioch College. Hall went on to work under William James, earning his PhD. Eventually,

he became the first president of Clark University in Massachusetts when it was founded (Pickren & Rutherford,
2010).
The Association for Psychological Science (APS) was founded in 1988 and seeks to advance the scientific
orientation of psychology. Its founding resulted from disagreements between members of the scientific and
clinical branches of psychology within the APA. The APS publishes five research journals and engages in
education and advocacy with funding agencies. A significant proportion of its members are international,
although the majority is located in the United States. Other organizations provide networking and
collaboration opportunities for professionals of several ethnic or racial groups working in psychology, such as
the National Latina/o Psychological Association (NLPA), the Asian American Psychological Association (AAPA),
the Association of Black Psychologists (ABPsi), and the Society of Indian Psychologists (SIP). Most of these
groups are also dedicated to studying psychological and social issues within their specific communities.
This section will provide an overview of the major subdivisions within psychology today in the order in which
they are introduced throughout the remainder of this textbook. This is not meant to be an exhaustive listing,
but it will provide insight into the major areas of research and practice of modern-day psychologists.

Biopsychology and Evolutionary Psychology
As the name suggests, biopsychology explores how our biology influences our behavior. While biological
psychology is a broad field, many biological psychologists want to understand how the structure and function
of the nervous system is related to behavior (Figure 1.10). As such, they often combine the research strategies
of both psychologists and physiologists to accomplish this goal (as discussed in Carlson, 2013).
FIGURE 1.10 Biological psychologists study how the structure and function of the nervous system generate
behavior.
The research interests of biological psychologists span a number of domains, including but not limited to,
1.3 • Contemporary Psychology 19
sensory and motor systems, sleep, drug use and abuse, ingestive behavior, reproductive behavior,
neurodevelopment, plasticity of the nervous system, and biological correlates of psychological disorders.
Given the broad areas of interest falling under the purview of biological psychology, it will probably come as no
surprise that individuals from all sorts of backgrounds are involved in this research, including biologists,
medical professionals, physiologists, and chemists. This interdisciplinary approach is often referred to as
neuroscience, of which biological psychology is a component (Carlson, 2013).
While biopsychology typically focuses on the immediate causes of behavior based in the physiology of a
human or other animal, evolutionary psychology seeks to study the ultimate biological causes of behavior. To
the extent that a behavior is impacted by genetics, a behavior, like any anatomical characteristic of a human or
animal, will demonstrate adaption to its surroundings. These surroundings include the physical environment
and, since interactions between organisms can be important to survival and reproduction, the social
environment. The study of behavior in the context of evolution has its origins with Charles Darwin, the co-
discoverer of the theory of evolution by natural selection. Darwin was well aware that behaviors should be
adaptive and wrote books titled, The Descent of Man (1871) and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and
Animals (1872), to explore this field.
Evolutionary psychology, and specifically, the evolutionary psychology of humans, has enjoyed a resurgence in
recent decades. To be subject to evolution by natural selection, a behavior must have a significant genetic
cause. In general, we expect all human cultures to express a behavior if it is caused genetically, since the
genetic differences among human groups are small. The approach taken by most evolutionary psychologists is
to predict the outcome of a behavior in a particular situation based on evolutionary theory and then to make
observations, or conduct experiments, to determine whether the results match the theory. It is important to
recognize that these types of studies are not strong evidence that a behavior is adaptive, since they lack
information that the behavior is in some part genetic and not entirely cultural (Endler, 1986). Demonstrating
that a trait, especially in humans, is naturally selected is extraordinarily difficult; perhaps for this reason,
some evolutionary psychologists are content to assume the behaviors they study have genetic determinants
(Confer et al., 2010).
One other drawback of evolutionary psychology is that the traits that we possess now evolved under
environmental and social conditions far back in human history, and we have a poor understanding of what
these conditions were. This makes predictions about what is adaptive for a behavior difficult. Behavioral traits
need not be adaptive under current conditions, only under the conditions of the past when they evolved, about
which we can only hypothesize.
There are many areas of human behavior for which evolution can make predictions. Examples include
memory, mate choice, relationships between kin, friendship and cooperation, parenting, social organization,
and status (Confer et al., 2010).
Evolutionary psychologists have had success in finding experimental correspondence between observations
and expectations. In one example, in a study of mate preference differences between men and women that
spanned 37 cultures, Buss (1989) found that women valued earning potential factors greater than men, and
men valued potential reproductive factors (youth and attractiveness) greater than women in their prospective
mates. In general, the predictions were in line with the predictions of evolution, although there were deviations
in some cultures.
Sensation and Perception
Scientists interested in both physiological aspects of sensory systems as well as in the psychological
experience of sensory information work within the area of sensation and perception (Figure 1.11). As such,
sensation and perception research is also quite interdisciplinary. Imagine walking between buildings as you
move from one class to another. You are inundated with sights, sounds, touch sensations, and smells. You also
experience the temperature of the air around you and maintain your balance as you make your way. These are

How can we go about finding answers that are supported not by mere opinion, but by evidence that we can all
agree on? The findings of psychological research can help us navigate issues like this.
2.1 Why Is Research Important?
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Explain how scientific research addresses questions about behavior
• Discuss how scientific research guides public policy
• Appreciate how scientific research can be important in making personal decisions
Scientific research is a critical tool for successfully navigating our complex world. Without it, we would be
forced to rely solely on intuition, other people’s authority, and blind luck. While many of us feel confident in
our abilities to decipher and interact with the world around us, history is filled with examples of how very
wrong we can be when we fail to recognize the need for evidence in supporting claims. At various times in
history, we would have been certain that the sun revolved around a flat earth, that the earth’s continents did
not move, and that mental illness was caused by possession (Figure 2.2). It is through systematic scientific
research that we divest ourselves of our preconceived notions and superstitions and gain an objective
understanding of ourselves and our world.
FIGURE 2.2 Some of our ancestors, across the world and over the centuries, believed that trephination—the
practice of making a hole in the skull, as shown here—allowed evil spirits to leave the body, thus curing mental
illness and other disorders. (credit: “taiproject”/Flickr)
The goal of all scientists is to better understand the world around them. Psychologists focus their attention on
understanding behavior, as well as the cognitive (mental) and physiological (body) processes that underlie
behavior. In contrast to other methods that people use to understand the behavior of others, such as intuition
and personal experience, the hallmark of scientific research is that there is evidence to support a claim.
Scientific knowledge is empirical: It is grounded in objective, tangible evidence that can be observed time and
time again, regardless of who is observing.
While behavior is observable, the mind is not. If someone is crying, we can see behavior. However, the reason
for the behavior is more difficult to determine. Is the person crying due to being sad, in pain, or happy?
Sometimes we can learn the reason for someone’s behavior by simply asking a question, like “Why are you
crying?” However, there are situations in which an individual is either uncomfortable or unwilling to answer
the question honestly, or is incapable of answering. For example, infants would not be able to explain why they
are crying. In such circumstances, the psychologist must be creative in finding ways to better understand
behavior. This chapter explores how scientific knowledge is generated, and how important that knowledge is in
forming decisions in our personal lives and in the public domain.

Use of Research Information
Trying to determine which theories are and are not accepted by the scientific community can be difficult,
especially in an area of research as broad as psychology. More than ever before, we have an incredible amount
of information at our fingertips, and a simple internet search on any given research topic might result in a
number of contradictory studies. In these cases, we are witnessing the scientific community going through the
process of reaching a consensus, and it could be quite some time before a consensus emerges. For example,
the explosion in our use of technology has led researchers to question whether this ultimately helps or hinders
us. The use and implementation of technology in educational settings has become widespread over the last few
decades. Researchers are coming to different conclusions regarding the use of technology. To illustrate this
point, a study investigating a smartphone app targeting surgery residents (graduate students in surgery
training) found that the use of this app can increase student engagement and raise test scores (Shaw & Tan,
2015). Conversely, another study found that the use of technology in undergraduate student populations had
negative impacts on sleep, communication, and time management skills (Massimini & Peterson, 2009). Until
sufficient amounts of research have been conducted, there will be no clear consensus on the effects that
technology has on a student's acquisition of knowledge, study skills, and mental health.
In the meantime, we should strive to think critically about the information we encounter by exercising a degree
of healthy skepticism. When someone makes a claim, we should examine the claim from a number of different
perspectives: what is the expertise of the person making the claim, what might they gain if the claim is valid,
does the claim seem justified given the evidence, and what do other researchers think of the claim? This is
especially important when we consider how much information in advertising campaigns and on the internet
claims to be based on “scientific evidence” when in actuality it is a belief or perspective of just a few
individuals trying to sell a product or draw attention to their perspectives.
We should be informed consumers of the information made available to us because decisions based on this
information have significant consequences. One such consequence can be seen in politics and public policy.
Imagine that you have been elected as the governor of your state. One of your responsibilities is to manage the
state budget and determine how to best spend your constituents’ tax dollars. As the new governor, you need to
decide whether to continue funding early intervention programs. These programs are designed to help
children who come from low-income backgrounds, have special needs, or face other disadvantages. These
programs may involve providing a wide variety of services to maximize the children's development and
position them for optimal levels of success in school and later in life (Blann, 2005). While such programs
sound appealing, you would want to be sure that they also proved effective before investing additional money
in these programs. Fortunately, psychologists and other scientists have conducted vast amounts of research on
such programs and, in general, the programs are found to be effective (Neil & Christensen, 2009; Peters-
Scheffer, Didden, Korzilius, & Sturmey, 2011). While not all programs are equally effective, and the short-term
effects of many such programs are more pronounced, there is reason to believe that many of these programs
produce long-term benefits for participants (Barnett, 2011). If you are committed to being a good steward of
taxpayer money, you would want to look at research. Which programs are most effective? What characteristics
of these programs make them effective? Which programs promote the best outcomes? After examining the
research, you would be best equipped to make decisions about which programs to fund.

how scientists evaluate effectiveness and how best to invest money into programs that are most effective.
Ultimately, it is not just politicians who can benefit from using research in guiding their decisions. We all might
look to research from time to time when making decisions in our lives. Imagine you just found out that your
sister Maria's child, Umberto, was recently diagnosed with autism. There are many treatments for autism that
help decrease the negative impact of autism on the individual. Some examples of treatments for autism are
2.1 • Why Is Research Important? 37
applied behavior analysis (ABA), social communication groups, social skills groups, occupational therapy, and
even medication options. If Maria asked you for advice or guidance, what would you do? You would likely want
to review the research and learn about the efficacy of each treatment so you could best advise your sister.
In the end, research is what makes the difference between facts and opinions. Facts are observable realities,
and opinions are personal judgments, conclusions, or attitudes that may or may not be accurate. In the
scientific community, facts can be established only using evidence collected through empirical research.
NOTABLE RESEARCHERS
Psychological research has a long history involving important figures from diverse backgrounds. While the
introductory chapter discussed several researchers who made significant contributions to the discipline, there
are many more individuals who deserve attention in considering how psychology has advanced as a science
through their work (Figure 2.3). For instance, Margaret Floy Washburn (1871–1939) was the first woman to
earn a PhD in psychology. Her research focused on animal behavior and cognition (Margaret Floy Washburn,
PhD, n.d.). Mary Whiton Calkins (1863–1930) was a preeminent first-generation American psychologist who
opposed the behaviorist movement, conducted significant research into memory, and established one of the
earliest experimental psychology labs in the United States (Mary Whiton Calkins, n.d.).
Francis Sumner (1895–1954) was the first African American to receive a PhD in psychology in 1920. His
dissertation focused on issues related to psychoanalysis. Sumner also had research interests in racial bias and
educational justice. Sumner was one of the founders of Howard University’s department of psychology, and
because of his accomplishments, he is sometimes referred to as the “Father of Black Psychology.” Thirteen
years later, Inez Beverly Prosser (1895–1934) became the first African American woman to receive a PhD in
psychology. Prosser’s research highlighted issues related to education in segregated versus integrated schools,
and ultimately, her work was very influential in the hallmark Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court
ruling that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional (Ethnicity and Health in America Series:
Featured Psychologists, n.d.).
FIGURE 2.3 (a) Margaret Floy Washburn was the first woman to earn a doctorate degree in psychology. (b) The
outcome of Brown v. Board of Education was influenced by the research of psychologist Inez Beverly Prosser, who
was the first African American woman to earn a PhD in psychology.
Although the establishment of psychology’s scientific roots occurred first in Europe and the United States, it
did not take much time until researchers from around the world began to establish their own laboratories and
research programs. For example, some of the first experimental psychology laboratories in South America
were founded by Horatio Piñero (1869–1919) at two institutions in Buenos Aires, Argentina (Godoy & Brussino,
2010). In India, Gunamudian David Boaz (1908–1965) and Narendra Nath Sen Gupta (1889–1944) established
38 2 • Psychological Research

the first independent departments of psychology at the University of Madras and the University of Calcutta,
respectively. These developments provided an opportunity for Indian researchers to make important
contributions to the field (Gunamudian David Boaz, n.d.; Narendra Nath Sen Gupta, n.d.).
When the American Psychological Association (APA) was first founded in 1892, all of the members were White
males (Women and Minorities in Psychology, n.d.). However, by 1905, Mary Whiton Calkins was elected as the
first female president of the APA, and by 1946, nearly one-quarter of American psychologists were female.
Psychology became a popular degree option for students enrolled in the nation’s historically Black higher
education institutions, increasing the number of Black Americans who went on to become psychologists. Given
demographic shifts occurring in the United States and increased access to higher educational opportunities
among historically underrepresented populations, there is reason to hope that the diversity of the field will
increasingly match the larger population, and that the research contributions made by the psychologists of the
future will better serve people of all backgrounds (Women and Minorities in Psychology, n.d.).
The Process of Scientific Research
Scientific knowledge is advanced through a process known as the scientific method. Basically, ideas (in the
form of theories and hypotheses) are tested against the real world (in the form of empirical observations), and
those empirical observations lead to more ideas that are tested against the real world, and so on. In this sense,
the scientific process is circular. The types of reasoning within the circle are called deductive and inductive. In
deductive reasoning, ideas are tested in the real world; in inductive reasoning, real-world observations lead
to new ideas (Figure 2.4). These processes are inseparable, like inhaling and exhaling, but different research
approaches place different emphasis on the deductive and inductive aspects.
FIGURE 2.4 Psychological research relies on both inductive and deductive reasoning.
In the scientific context, deductive reasoning begins with a generalization—one hypothesis—that is then used
to reach logical conclusions about the real world. If the hypothesis is correct, then the logical conclusions
reached through deductive reasoning should also be correct. A deductive reasoning argument might go
something like this: All living things require energy to survive (this would be your hypothesis). Ducks are living
things. Therefore, ducks require energy to survive (logical conclusion). In this example, the hypothesis is
correct; therefore, the conclusion is correct as well. Sometimes, however, an incorrect hypothesis may lead to a
logical but incorrect conclusion. Consider this argument: all ducks are born with the ability to see. Quackers is
a duck. Therefore, Quackers was born with the ability to see. Scientists use deductive reasoning to empirically
test their hypotheses. Returning to the example of the ducks, researchers might design a study to test the
hypothesis that if all living things require energy to survive, then ducks will be found to require energy to
survive.
Deductive reasoning starts with a generalization that is tested against real-world observations; however,
inductive reasoning moves in the opposite direction. Inductive reasoning uses empirical observations to
2.1 • Why Is Research Important? 39
construct broad generalizations. Unlike deductive reasoning, conclusions drawn from inductive reasoning
may or may not be correct, regardless of the observations on which they are based. For instance, you may
notice that your favorite fruits—apples, bananas, and oranges—all grow on trees; therefore, you assume that all
fruit must grow on trees. This would be an example of inductive reasoning, and, clearly, the existence of
strawberries, blueberries, and kiwi demonstrate that this generalization is not correct despite it being based
on a number of direct observations. Scientists use inductive reasoning to formulate theories, which in turn
generate hypotheses that are tested with deductive reasoning. In the end, science involves both deductive and
inductive processes.
For example, case studies, which you will read about in the next section, are heavily weighted on the side of
empirical observations. Thus, case studies are closely associated with inductive processes as researchers
gather massive amounts of observations and seek interesting patterns (new ideas) in the data. Experimental
research, on the other hand, puts great emphasis on deductive reasoning.
We’ve stated that theories and hypotheses are ideas, but what sort of ideas are they, exactly? A theory is a well-
developed set of ideas that propose an explanation for observed phenomena. Theories are repeatedly checked
against the world, but they tend to be too complex to be tested all at once; instead, researchers create
hypotheses to test specific aspects of a theory.
A hypothesis is a testable prediction about how the world will behave if our idea is correct, and it is often
worded as an if-then statement (e.g., if I study all night, I will get a passing grade on the test). The hypothesis is
extremely important because it bridges the gap between the realm of ideas and the real world. As specific
hypotheses are tested, theories are modified and refined to reflect and incorporate the result of these tests
Figure 2.5.
FIGURE 2.5 The scientific method involves deriving hypotheses from theories and then testing those hypotheses. If
the results are consistent with the theory, then the theory is supported. If the results are not consistent, then the
theory should be modified and new hypotheses will be generated.
To see how this process works, let’s consider a specific theory and a hypothesis that might be generated from
that theory. As you’ll learn in a later chapter, the James-Lange theory of emotion asserts that emotional
experience relies on the physiological arousal associated with the emotional state. If you walked out of your
home and discovered a very aggressive snake waiting on your doorstep, your heart would begin to race and
your stomach churn. According to the James-Lange theory, these physiological changes would result in your

Context: FIGURE 1.7 Maslow’s hierarchy of needs is shown. Carl Rogers (1902–1987) was also an American psychologist who, like Maslow, emphasized the potential for good that exists within all people (Figure 1.8). Rogers used a therapeutic technique known as client-centered therapy in helping his clients deal with problematic issues that resulted in their seeking psychotherapy. Unlike a psychoanalytic approach in which the therapist plays an important role in interpreting what conscious behavior reveals about the unconscious mind, client-centered therapy involves the patient taking a lead role in the therapy session. Rogers believed that a therapist needed to display three features to maximize the effectiveness of this particular approach: unconditional positive regard, genuineness, and empathy. Unconditional positive regard refers to the fact that the therapist accepts their client for who they are, no matter what they might say. Provided these factors, Rogers believed that people were more than capable of dealing with and working through their own issues (Thorne & Henley, 2005). FIGURE 1.8 Carl Rogers, shown in this portrait, developed a client-centered therapy method that has been influential in clinical settings. (credit: ""Didius""/Wikimedia Commons) Humanism has been influential to psychology as a whole. Both Maslow and Rogers are well-known names among students of psychology (you will read more about both later in this text), and their ideas have influenced many scholars. Furthermore, Rogers’ client-centered approach to therapy is still commonly used in psychotherapeutic settings today (O’hara, n.d.) 1.2 • History of Psychology 15 LINK T O LEARNING View a brief video of Carl Rogers describing his therapeutic approach (http://openstax.org/l/crogers1) to learn more. The Cognitive Revolution Behaviorism’s emphasis on objectivity and focus on external behavior had pulled psychologists’ attention away from the mind for a prolonged period of time. The early work of the humanistic psychologists redirected attention to the individual human as a whole, and as a conscious and self-aware being. By the 1950s, new disciplinary perspectives in linguistics, neuroscience, and computer science were emerging, all of which led to a renewed interest in the study of human behavior and cognition. These new perspectives were referred to as the cognitive revolution. In this chapter, we will examine the major developments in psychology that occurred during this time period. We will also discuss the impact of these developments on the field of psychology today. Cognitive Psychology In the mid-18th century, the French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau argued that humans are born with a natural tendency to seek pleasure and avoid pain. This natural tendency, which he called the “soul’s instinct” (Rousseau, p. 33), is what drives us to act in accordance with our desires and to pursue our goals. However, this natural inclination can also lead to negative consequences. For example, if a person chooses to engage in an activity that is harmful to themselves or others, they may experience negative emotions such as guilt, shame, anger, or fear. As a result, these negative emotions may lead the person to act in ways that are not in line with their natural inclinations. Thus, it is natural for humans to experience negative emotions, but this does not mean that these emotions are inherently bad or harmful. Rather, humans have the ability to control their emotions and use them to achieve their goals. In order to understand how humans can control and change their emotional responses, psychologists developed a theory of emotion. According to this theory, emotions can be divided into two broad categories: emotional states and emotional reactions. An emotional state is a state of mind or mental state that characterizes a particular emotional experience. Emotions are characterized by a range of physical and psychological characteristics, including changes in heart rate, blood pressure, respiration, muscle tension, and skin conductance. Emotional reactions are the outward manifestations of emotional states. They are often associated with physical and psychological symptoms. Emotional reactions can take the form of physiological changes, such as sweating or shivering, as well as behavioral changes. Physiological changes can include increased heart rate, increased breathing, sweating, shaking, trembling, nausea, dizziness, palpitations, tremors, anxiety, restlessness, irritability, agitation, depression, euphoria, excitement, sadness, fear, panic, etc. Behavioral changes can include physical symptoms, emotional symptoms (e.g., anger or sadness), or a combination of both.

1.4 Careers in Psychology
Clive Wearing is an accomplished musician who lost his ability to form new memories when
he became sick at the age of 46. While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember
what he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is
associated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend’s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John
Nash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would
tell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended
for him. He also began to hear voices and became suspicious of the people around him. Soon thereafter, Nash
was diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a state-run mental institution (O’Connor & Robertson,
1Introduction to Psychology
2002). Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these
experiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain’s internal
processes and people’s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of
psychology has explored these questions.
1.1 What Is Psychology?
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Define psychology
• Understand the merits of an education in psychology
What is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology
explores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists
use the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question
about how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the
phenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or
group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over
time. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes
observations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then
published or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.
Scientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because
it is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We
must ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However,
we can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus,
psychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.
In general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot
arrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the
mind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific
method is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on
observation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or
previous authorities.
It was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this
time, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is,
at its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological
organism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore,
psychology is also a social science.
WHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?
Often, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to
learn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course
because it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as
nursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare
psychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses
across the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology
majors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook’s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality
and political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About
6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S.
Department of Education, 2016).

An education in psychology is valuable for a number of reasons. Psychology students hone critical thinking
skills and are trained in the use of the scientific method. Critical thinking is the active application of a set of
skills to information for the understanding and evaluation of that information. The evaluation of
information—assessing its reliability and usefulness— is an important skill in a world full of competing “facts,”
many of which are designed to be misleading. For example, critical thinking involves maintaining an attitude
of skepticism, recognizing internal biases, making use of logical thinking, asking appropriate questions, and
making observations. Psychology students also can develop better communication skills during the course of
their undergraduate coursework (American Psychological Association, 2011). Together, these factors increase
students’ scientific literacy and prepare students to critically evaluate the various sources of information they
encounter.
In addition to these broad-based skills, psychology students come to understand the complex factors that
shape one’s behavior. They appreciate the interaction of our biology, our environment, and our experiences in
determining who we are and how we will behave. They learn about basic principles that guide how we think
and behave, and they come to recognize the tremendous diversity that exists across individuals and across
cultural boundaries (American Psychological Association, 2011).

1.2 History of Psychology
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Understand the importance of Wundt and James in the development of psychology
• Appreciate Freud’s influence on psychology
• Understand the basic tenets of Gestalt psychology
• Appreciate the important role that behaviorism played in psychology’s history
• Understand basic tenets of humanism
• Understand how the cognitive revolution shifted psychology’s focus back to the mind
Psychology is a relatively young science with its experimental roots in the 19th century, compared, for
example, to human physiology, which dates much earlier. As mentioned, anyone interested in exploring issues
related to the mind generally did so in a philosophical context prior to the 19th century. Two 19th century
scholars, Wilhelm Wundt and William James, are generally credited as being the founders of psychology as a
science and academic discipline that was distinct from philosophy. This section will provide an overview of the
shifts in paradigms that have influenced psychology from Wundt and James through today.
Wundt and Structuralism
Wilhelm Wundt (1832–1920) was a German scientist who was the first person to be referred to as a
psychologist. His famous book entitled Principles of Physiological Psychology was published in 1873. Wundt
viewed psychology as a scientific study of conscious experience, and he believed that the goal of psychology
was to identify components of consciousness and how those components combined to result in our conscious
experience. Wundt used introspection (he called it “internal perception”), a process by which someone
examines their own conscious experience as objectively as possible, making the human mind like any other
aspect of nature that a scientist observed. He believed in the notion of voluntarism—that people have free will
and should know the intentions of a psychological experiment if they were participating (Danziger, 1980).
Wundt considered his version experimental introspection; he used instruments such as those that measured
reaction time. He also wrote Volkerpsychologie in 1904 in which he suggested that psychology should include
the study of culture, as it involves the study of people. Edward Titchener, one of his students, went on to
1.2 • History of Psychology 9
develop structuralism. Its focus was on the contents of mental processes rather than their function (Pickren &
Rutherford, 2010). Wundt established his psychology laboratory at the University at Leipzig in 1879 (Figure
1.2). In this laboratory, Wundt and his students conducted experiments on, for example, reaction times. A
subject, sometimes in a room isolated from the scientist, would receive a stimulus such as a light, image, or
sound. The subject’s reaction to the stimulus would be to push a button, and an apparatus would record the
time to reaction. Wundt could measure reaction time to one-thousandth of a second (Nicolas & Ferrand, 1999).
FIGURE 1.2 (a) Wilhelm Wundt is credited as one of the founders of psychology. He created the first laboratory for
psychological research. (b) This photo shows him seated and surrounded by fellow researchers and equipment in
his laboratory in Germany.
However, despite his efforts to train individuals in the process of introspection, this process remained highly
subjective, and there was very little agreement between individuals.
Functionalism
William James, John Dewey, and Charles Sanders Peirce helped establish functional psychology (Figure 1.3).
They accepted Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection and viewed this theory as an explanation of an
organism’s characteristics. Key to that theory is the idea that natural selection leads to organisms that are
adapted to their environment, including their behavior. Adaptation means that a trait of an organism has a
function for the survival and reproduction of the individual, because it has been naturally selected. As James
saw it, psychology’s purpose was to study the function of behavior in the world, and as such, his perspective
was known as functionalism. Functionalism focused on how mental activities helped an organism fit into its
environment. Functionalism has a second, more subtle meaning in that functionalists were more interested in
the operation of the whole mind rather than of its individual parts, which were the focus of structuralism. Like
Wundt, James believed that introspection could serve as one means by which someone might study mental
activities, but James also relied on more objective measures, including the use of various recording devices,
and examinations of concrete products of mental activities and of anatomy and physiology (Gordon, 1995).

Use of Research Information
Trying to determine which theories are and are not accepted by the scientific community can be difficult,
especially in an area of research as broad as psychology. More than ever before, we have an incredible amount
of information at our fingertips, and a simple internet search on any given research topic might result in a
number of contradictory studies. In these cases, we are witnessing the scientific community going through the
process of reaching a consensus, and it could be quite some time before a consensus emerges. For example,
the explosion in our use of technology has led researchers to question whether this ultimately helps or hinders
us. The use and implementation of technology in educational settings has become widespread over the last few
decades. Researchers are coming to different conclusions regarding the use of technology. To illustrate this
point, a study investigating a smartphone app targeting surgery residents (graduate students in surgery
training) found that the use of this app can increase student engagement and raise test scores (Shaw & Tan,
2015). Conversely, another study found that the use of technology in undergraduate student populations had
negative impacts on sleep, communication, and time management skills (Massimini & Peterson, 2009). Until
sufficient amounts of research have been conducted, there will be no clear consensus on the effects that
technology has on a student's acquisition of knowledge, study skills, and mental health.
In the meantime, we should strive to think critically about the information we encounter by exercising a degree
of healthy skepticism. When someone makes a claim, we should examine the claim from a number of different
perspectives: what is the expertise of the person making the claim, what might they gain if the claim is valid,
does the claim seem justified given the evidence, and what do other researchers think of the claim? This is
especially important when we consider how much information in advertising campaigns and on the internet
claims to be based on “scientific evidence” when in actuality it is a belief or perspective of just a few
individuals trying to sell a product or draw attention to their perspectives.
We should be informed consumers of the information made available to us because decisions based on this
information have significant consequences. One such consequence can be seen in politics and public policy.
Imagine that you have been elected as the governor of your state. One of your responsibilities is to manage the
state budget and determine how to best spend your constituents’ tax dollars. As the new governor, you need to
decide whether to continue funding early intervention programs. These programs are designed to help
children who come from low-income backgrounds, have special needs, or face other disadvantages. These
programs may involve providing a wide variety of services to maximize the children's development and
position them for optimal levels of success in school and later in life (Blann, 2005). While such programs
sound appealing, you would want to be sure that they also proved effective before investing additional money
in these programs. Fortunately, psychologists and other scientists have conducted vast amounts of research on
such programs and, in general, the programs are found to be effective (Neil & Christensen, 2009; Peters-
Scheffer, Didden, Korzilius, & Sturmey, 2011). While not all programs are equally effective, and the short-term
effects of many such programs are more pronounced, there is reason to believe that many of these programs
produce long-term benefits for participants (Barnett, 2011). If you are committed to being a good steward of
taxpayer money, you would want to look at research. Which programs are most effective? What characteristics
of these programs make them effective? Which programs promote the best outcomes? After examining the
research, you would be best equipped to make decisions about which programs to fund.
LINK T O LEARNING
Watch this video about early childhood program effectiveness (http://openstax.org/l/programeffect) to learn
how scientists evaluate effectiveness and how best to invest money into programs that are most effective.
Ultimately, it is not just politicians who can benefit from using research in guiding their decisions. We all might
look to research from time to time when making decisions in our lives. Imagine you just found out that your
sister Maria's child, Umberto, was recently diagnosed with autism. There are many treatments for autism that
help decrease the negative impact of autism on the individual. Some examples of treatments for autism are
2.1 • Why Is Research Important? 37
applied behavior analysis (ABA), social communication groups, social skills groups, occupational therapy, and
even medication options. If Maria asked you for advice or guidance, what would you do? You would likely want
to review the research and learn about the efficacy of each treatment so you could best advise your sister.
In the end, research is what makes the difference between facts and opinions. Facts are observable realities,
and opinions are personal judgments, conclusions, or attitudes that may or may not be accurate. In the
scientific community, facts can be established only using evidence collected through empirical research.
NOTABLE RESEARCHERS
Psychological research has a long history involving important figures from diverse backgrounds. While the
introductory chapter discussed several researchers who made significant contributions to the discipline, there
are many more individuals who deserve attention in considering how psychology has advanced as a science
through their work (Figure 2.3). For instance, Margaret Floy Washburn (1871–1939) was the first woman to
earn a PhD in psychology. Her research focused on animal behavior and cognition (Margaret Floy Washburn,
PhD, n.d.). Mary Whiton Calkins (1863–1930) was a preeminent first-generation American psychologist who
opposed the behaviorist movement, conducted significant research into memory, and established one of the
earliest experimental psychology labs in the United States (Mary Whiton Calkins, n.d.).
Francis Sumner (1895–1954) was the first African American to receive a PhD in psychology in 1920. His
dissertation focused on issues related to psychoanalysis. Sumner also had research interests in racial bias and
educational justice. Sumner was one of the founders of Howard University’s department of psychology, and
because of his accomplishments, he is sometimes referred to as the “Father of Black Psychology.” Thirteen
years later, Inez Beverly Prosser (1895–1934) became the first African American woman to receive a PhD in
psychology. Prosser’s research highlighted issues related to education in segregated versus integrated schools,
and ultimately, her work was very influential in the hallmark Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court
ruling that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional (Ethnicity and Health in America Series:
Featured Psychologists, n.d.).
FIGURE 2.3 (a) Margaret Floy Washburn was the first woman to earn a doctorate degree in psychology. (b) The
outcome of Brown v. Board of Education was influenced by the research of psychologist Inez Beverly Prosser, who
was the first African American woman to earn a PhD in psychology.
Although the establishment of psychology’s scientific roots occurred first in Europe and the United States, it
did not take much time until researchers from around the world began to establish their own laboratories and
research programs. For example, some of the first experimental psychology laboratories in South America
were founded by Horatio Piñero (1869–1919) at two institutions in Buenos Aires, Argentina (Godoy & Brussino,
2010). In India, Gunamudian David Boaz (1908–1965) and Narendra Nath Sen Gupta (1889–1944) established
38 2 • Psychological Research
Access for free at openstax.org
the first independent departments of psychology at the University of Madras and the University of Calcutta,
respectively. These developments provided an opportunity for Indian researchers to make important
contributions to the field (Gunamudian David Boaz, n.d.; Narendra Nath Sen Gupta, n.d.).
When the American Psychological Association (APA) was first founded in 1892, all of the members were White
males (Women and Minorities in Psychology, n.d.). However, by 1905, Mary Whiton Calkins was elected as the
first female president of the APA, and by 1946, nearly one-quarter of American psychologists were female.
Psychology became a popular degree option for students enrolled in the nation’s historically Black higher
education institutions, increasing the number of Black Americans who went on to become psychologists. Given
demographic shifts occurring in the United States and increased access to higher educational opportunities
among historically underrepresented populations, there is reason to hope that the diversity of the field will
increasingly match the larger population, and that the research contributions made by the psychologists of the
future will better serve people of all backgrounds (Women and Minorities in Psychology, n.d.).
The Process of Scientific Research
Scientific knowledge is advanced through a process known as the scientific method. Basically, ideas (in the
form of theories and hypotheses) are tested against the real world (in the form of empirical observations), and
those empirical observations lead to more ideas that are tested against the real world, and so on. In this sense,
the scientific process is circular. The types of reasoning within the circle are called deductive and inductive. In
deductive reasoning, ideas are tested in the real world; in inductive reasoning, real-world observations lead
to new ideas (Figure 2.4). These processes are inseparable, like inhaling and exhaling, but different research
approaches place different emphasis on the deductive and inductive aspects.
FIGURE 2.4 Psychological research relies on both inductive and deductive reasoning.
In the scientific context, deductive reasoning begins with a generalization—one hypothesis—that is then used
to reach logical conclusions about the real world. If the hypothesis is correct, then the logical conclusions
reached through deductive reasoning should also be correct. A deductive reasoning argument might go
something like this: All living things require energy to survive (this would be your hypothesis). Ducks are living
things. Therefore, ducks require energy to survive (logical conclusion). In this example, the hypothesis is
correct; therefore, the conclusion is correct as well. Sometimes, however, an incorrect hypothesis may lead to a
logical but incorrect conclusion. Consider this argument: all ducks are born with the ability to see. Quackers is
a duck. Therefore, Quackers was born with the ability to see. Scientists use deductive reasoning to empirically
test their hypotheses. Returning to the example of the ducks, researchers might design a study to test the
hypothesis that if all living things require energy to survive, then ducks will be found to require energy to
survive.
Deductive reasoning starts with a generalization that is tested against real-world observations; however,
inductive reasoning moves in the opposite direction. Inductive reasoning uses empirical observations to
2.1 • Why Is Research Important? 39
construct broad generalizations. Unlike deductive reasoning, conclusions drawn from inductive reasoning
may or may not be correct, regardless of the observations on which they are based. For instance, you may
notice that your favorite fruits—apples, bananas, and oranges—all grow on trees; therefore, you assume that all
fruit must grow on trees. This would be an example of inductive reasoning, and, clearly, the existence of
strawberries, blueberries, and kiwi demonstrate that this generalization is not correct despite it being based
on a number of direct observations. Scientists use inductive reasoning to formulate theories, which in turn
generate hypotheses that are tested with deductive reasoning. In the end, science involves both deductive and
inductive processes.
For example, case studies, which you will read about in the next section, are heavily weighted on the side of
empirical observations. Thus, case studies are closely associated with inductive processes as researchers
gather massive amounts of observations and seek interesting patterns (new ideas) in the data. Experimental
research, on the other hand, puts great emphasis on deductive reasoning.
We’ve stated that theories and hypotheses are ideas, but what sort of ideas are they, exactly? A theory is a well-
developed set of ideas that propose an explanation for observed phenomena. Theories are repeatedly checked
against the world, but they tend to be too complex to be tested all at once; instead, researchers create
hypotheses to test specific aspects of a theory.
A hypothesis is a testable prediction about how the world will behave if our idea is correct, and it is often
worded as an if-then statement (e.g., if I study all night, I will get a passing grade on the test). The hypothesis is
extremely important because it bridges the gap between the realm of ideas and the real world. As specific
hypotheses are tested, theories are modified and refined to reflect and incorporate the result of these tests
Figure 2.5.
FIGURE 2.5 The scientific method involves deriving hypotheses from theories and then testing those hypotheses. If
the results are consistent with the theory, then the theory is supported. If the results are not consistent, then the
theory should be modified and new hypotheses will be generated.
To see how this process works, let’s consider a specific theory and a hypothesis that might be generated from
that theory. As you’ll learn in a later chapter, the James-Lange theory of emotion asserts that emotional
experience relies on the physiological arousal associated with the emotional state. If you walked out of your
home and discovered a very aggressive snake waiting on your doorstep, your heart would begin to race and
your stomach churn. According to the James-Lange theory, these physiological changes would result in your
40 2 • Psychological Research
Access for free at openstax.org
feeling of fear. A hypothesis that could be derived from this theory might be that a person who is unaware of
the physiological arousal that the sight of the snake elicits will not feel fear.
A scientific hypothesis is also falsifiable, or capable of being shown to be incorrect. Recall from the
introductory chapter that Sigmund Freud had lots of interesting ideas to explain various human behaviors
(Figure 2.6). However, a major criticism of Freud’s theories is that many of his ideas are not falsifiable; for
example, it is impossible to imagine empirical observations that would disprove the existence of the id, the
ego, and the superego—the three elements of personality described in Freud’s theories. Despite this, Freud’s
theories are widely taught in introductory psychology texts because of their historical significance for
personality psychology and psychotherapy, and these remain the root of all modern forms of therapy.
FIGURE 2.6 Many of the specifics of (a) Freud's theories, such as (b) his division of the mind into id, ego, and
superego, have fallen out of favor in recent decades because they are not falsifiable. In broader strokes, his views
set the stage for much of psychological thinking today, such as the unconscious nature of the majority of
psychological processes.
In contrast, the James-Lange theory does generate falsifiable hypotheses, such as the one described above.
Some individuals who suffer significant injuries to their spinal columns are unable to feel the bodily changes
that often accompany emotional experiences. Therefore, we could test the hypothesis by determining how
emotional experiences differ between individuals who have the ability to detect these changes in their
physiological arousal and those who do not. In fact, this research has been conducted and while the emotional
experiences of people deprived of an awareness of their physiological arousal may be less intense, they still
experience emotion (Chwalisz, Diener, & Gallagher, 1988).
Scientific research’s dependence on falsifiability allows for great confidence in the information that it
produces. Typically, by the time information is accepted by the scientific community, it has been tested
repeatedly.
2.2 Approaches to Research
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the different research methods used by psychologists
• Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of case studies, naturalistic observation, surveys, and archival research
• Compare longitudinal and cross-sectional approaches to research
• Compare and contrast correlation and causation
There are many research methods available to psychologists in their efforts to understand, describe, and
2.2 • Approaches to Research 41
explain behavior and the cognitive and biological processes that underlie it. Some methods rely on
observational techniques. Other approaches involve interactions between the researcher and the individuals
who are being studied—ranging from a series of simple questions to extensive, in-depth interviews—to well-
controlled experiments.
Each of these research methods has unique strengths and weaknesses, and each method may only be
appropriate for certain types of research questions. For example, studies that rely primarily on observation
produce incredible amounts of information, but the ability to apply this information to the larger population is
somewhat limited because of small sample sizes. Survey research, on the other hand, allows researchers to
easily collect data from relatively large samples. While this allows for results to be generalized to the larger
population more easily, the information that can be collected on any given survey is somewhat limited and
subject to problems associated with any type of self-reported data. Some researchers conduct archival
research by using existing records. While this can be a fairly inexpensive way to collect data that can provide
insight into a number of research questions, researchers using this approach have no control on how or what
kind of data was collected. All of the methods described thus far are correlational in nature. This means that
researchers can speak to important relationships that might exist between two or more variables of interest.
However, correlational data cannot be used to make claims about cause-and-effect relationships.
Correlational research can find a relationship between two variables, but the only way a researcher can claim
that the relationship between the variables is cause and effect is to perform an experiment. In experimental
research, which will be discussed later in this chapter, there is a tremendous amount of control over variables
of interest. While this is a powerful approach, experiments are often conducted in artificial settings. This calls
into question the validity of experimental findings with regard to how they would apply in real-world settings.
In addition, many of the questions that psychologists would like to answer cannot be pursued through
experimental research because of ethical concerns.
Clinical or Case Studies
In 2011, the New York Times published a feature story on Krista and Tatiana Hogan, Canadian twin girls.
These particular twins are unique because Krista and Tatiana are conjoined twins, connected at the head.
There is evidence that the two girls are connected in a part of the brain called the thalamus, which is a major
sensory relay center. Most incoming sensory information is sent through the thalamus before reaching higher
regions of the cerebral cortex for processing.

Watch this CBC video about Krista's and Tatiana's lives (http://openstax.org/l/hogans) to learn more.
The implications of this potential connection mean that it might be possible for one twin to experience the
sensations of the other twin. For instance, if Krista is watching a particularly funny television program, Tatiana
might smile or laugh even if she is not watching the program. This particular possibility has piqued the
interest of many neuroscientists who seek to understand how the brain uses sensory information.
These twins represent an enormous resource in the study of the brain, and since their condition is very rare, it
is likely that as long as their family agrees, scientists will follow these girls very closely throughout their lives to
gain as much information as possible (Dominus, 2011).
Over time, it has become clear that while Krista and Tatiana share some sensory experiences and motor
control, they remain two distinct individuals, which provides invaluable insight for researchers interested in
the mind and the brain (Egnor, 2017).
In observational research, scientists are conducting a clinical or case study when they focus on one person or
just a few individuals. Indeed, some scientists spend their entire careers studying just 10–20 individuals. Why
would they do this? Obviously, when they focus their attention on a very small number of people, they can gain

The word “psychology” comes from two Greek words, “psyche” and “logos,” which mean “mind” or “thinking.” Psychologists are interested in how the mind works and how we think and feel. They study the mental processes that occur in the brain, such as perception, attention, memory, thinking, problem solving, emotion, motivation, learning, decision making, self-regulation, personality, social behavior, etc. Psychologists use a variety of methods to study these processes, including observation, experiments, surveys, interviews, questionnaires, brain imaging, neuropsychology, cognitive neuroscience, psychometrics, clinical psychology, developmental psychology, ethnopsychology and social psychology. Psychology has a long and rich history. It has been practiced for thousands of years in many different cultures and societies. For example, in ancient Greece, Plato and Aristotle studied psychology in order to understand the nature of human beings and their relationships with each other and with their environment. In the Middle Ages, Christian theologians and philosophers used psychology as a tool for understanding the nature of God and his relationship with his creatures. During the Renaissance, scientists and thinkers such as Galileo Galilei, Isaac Newton, René Descartes, John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Auguste Comte, Jean-Paul Sartre, Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, William James, Edward Thorndike, B.F. Skinner and others developed theories of psychology that continue to shape our understanding of this field today. Today, psychology is a broad and diverse field that encompasses a wide range of subfields and disciplines. Some of these disciplines include: • Clinical psychology: This field focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders, as well as","{""sections"": [""Psychological Research/Analyzing Findings"", ""Introduction to Psychology/Contemporary Psychology""], ""pages"": [""51"", ""52"", ""20""]}"

1.4 Careers in Psychology
Clive Wearing is an accomplished musician who lost his ability to form new memories when
he became sick at the age of 46. While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember
what he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is
associated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend’s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John
Nash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would
tell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended
for him. He also began to hear voices and became suspicious of the people around him. Soon thereafter, Nash
was diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a state-run mental institution (O’Connor & Robertson,
1Introduction to Psychology
2002). Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these
experiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain’s internal
processes and people’s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of
psychology has explored these questions.
1.1 What Is Psychology?
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Define psychology
• Understand the merits of an education in psychology
What is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology
explores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists
use the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question
about how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the
phenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or
group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over
time. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes
observations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then
published or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.
Scientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because
it is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We
must ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However,
we can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus,
psychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.
In general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot
arrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the
mind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific
method is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on
observation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or
previous authorities.
It was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this
time, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is,
at its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological
organism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore,
psychology is also a social science.
WHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?
Often, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to
learn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course
because it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as
nursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare
psychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses
across the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology
majors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook’s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality
and political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About
6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S.
Department of Education, 2016).

An education in psychology is valuable for a number of reasons. Psychology students hone critical thinking
skills and are trained in the use of the scientific method. Critical thinking is the active application of a set of
skills to information for the understanding and evaluation of that information. The evaluation of
information—assessing its reliability and usefulness— is an important skill in a world full of competing “facts,”
many of which are designed to be misleading. For example, critical thinking involves maintaining an attitude
of skepticism, recognizing internal biases, making use of logical thinking, asking appropriate questions, and
making observations. Psychology students also can develop better communication skills during the course of
their undergraduate coursework (American Psychological Association, 2011). Together, these factors increase
students’ scientific literacy and prepare students to critically evaluate the various sources of information they
encounter.
In addition to these broad-based skills, psychology students come to understand the complex factors that
shape one’s behavior. They appreciate the interaction of our biology, our environment, and our experiences in
determining who we are and how we will behave. They learn about basic principles that guide how we think
and behave, and they come to recognize the tremendous diversity that exists across individuals and across
cultural boundaries (American Psychological Association, 2011).

1.2 History of Psychology
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Understand the importance of Wundt and James in the development of psychology
• Appreciate Freud’s influence on psychology
• Understand the basic tenets of Gestalt psychology
• Appreciate the important role that behaviorism played in psychology’s history
• Understand basic tenets of humanism
• Understand how the cognitive revolution shifted psychology’s focus back to the mind
Psychology is a relatively young science with its experimental roots in the 19th century, compared, for
example, to human physiology, which dates much earlier. As mentioned, anyone interested in exploring issues
related to the mind generally did so in a philosophical context prior to the 19th century. Two 19th century
scholars, Wilhelm Wundt and William James, are generally credited as being the founders of psychology as a
science and academic discipline that was distinct from philosophy. This section will provide an overview of the
shifts in paradigms that have influenced psychology from Wundt and James through today.
Wundt and Structuralism
Wilhelm Wundt (1832–1920) was a German scientist who was the first person to be referred to as a
psychologist. His famous book entitled Principles of Physiological Psychology was published in 1873. Wundt
viewed psychology as a scientific study of conscious experience, and he believed that the goal of psychology
was to identify components of consciousness and how those components combined to result in our conscious
experience. Wundt used introspection (he called it “internal perception”), a process by which someone
examines their own conscious experience as objectively as possible, making the human mind like any other
aspect of nature that a scientist observed. He believed in the notion of voluntarism—that people have free will
and should know the intentions of a psychological experiment if they were participating (Danziger, 1980).
Wundt considered his version experimental introspection; he used instruments such as those that measured
reaction time. He also wrote Volkerpsychologie in 1904 in which he suggested that psychology should include
the study of culture, as it involves the study of people. Edward Titchener, one of his students, went on to
1.2 • History of Psychology 9
develop structuralism. Its focus was on the contents of mental processes rather than their function (Pickren &
Rutherford, 2010). Wundt established his psychology laboratory at the University at Leipzig in 1879 (Figure
1.2). In this laboratory, Wundt and his students conducted experiments on, for example, reaction times. A
subject, sometimes in a room isolated from the scientist, would receive a stimulus such as a light, image, or
sound. The subject’s reaction to the stimulus would be to push a button, and an apparatus would record the
time to reaction. Wundt could measure reaction time to one-thousandth of a second (Nicolas & Ferrand, 1999).
FIGURE 1.2 (a) Wilhelm Wundt is credited as one of the founders of psychology. He created the first laboratory for
psychological research. (b) This photo shows him seated and surrounded by fellow researchers and equipment in
his laboratory in Germany.
However, despite his efforts to train individuals in the process of introspection, this process remained highly
subjective, and there was very little agreement between individuals.
Functionalism
William James, John Dewey, and Charles Sanders Peirce helped establish functional psychology (Figure 1.3).
They accepted Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection and viewed this theory as an explanation of an
organism’s characteristics. Key to that theory is the idea that natural selection leads to organisms that are
adapted to their environment, including their behavior. Adaptation means that a trait of an organism has a
function for the survival and reproduction of the individual, because it has been naturally selected. As James
saw it, psychology’s purpose was to study the function of behavior in the world, and as such, his perspective
was known as functionalism. Functionalism focused on how mental activities helped an organism fit into its
environment. Functionalism has a second, more subtle meaning in that functionalists were more interested in
the operation of the whole mind rather than of its individual parts, which were the focus of structuralism. Like
Wundt, James believed that introspection could serve as one means by which someone might study mental
activities, but James also relied on more objective measures, including the use of various recording devices,
and examinations of concrete products of mental activities and of anatomy and physiology (Gordon, 1995).

FIGURE 1.3 William James, shown here in a self-portrait, was the first American psychologist.
Freud and Psychoanalytic Theory
Perhaps one of the most influential and well-known figures in psychology’s history was Sigmund Freud (Figure
1.4). Freud (1856–1939) was an Austrian neurologist who was fascinated by patients suffering from “hysteria”
and neurosis. Hysteria was an ancient diagnosis for disorders, primarily of women with a wide variety of
symptoms, including physical symptoms and emotional disturbances, none of which had an apparent physical
cause. Freud theorized that many of his patients’ problems arose from the unconscious mind. In Freud’s view,
the unconscious mind was a repository of feelings and urges of which we have no awareness. Gaining access to
the unconscious, then, was crucial to the successful resolution of the patient’s problems. According to Freud,
the unconscious mind could be accessed through dream analysis, by examinations of the first words that came
to people’s minds, and through seemingly innocent slips of the tongue. Psychoanalytic theory focuses on the
role of a person’s unconscious, as well as early childhood experiences, and this particular perspective
dominated clinical psychology for several decades (Thorne & Henley, 2005).
FIGURE 1.4 (a) Sigmund Freud was a highly influential figure in the history of psychology. (b) One of his many
books, A General Introduction to Psychoanalysis, shared his ideas about psychoanalytical therapy; it was published
in 1922.
Freud’s ideas were influential, and you will learn more about them when you study lifespan development,
personality, and therapy. For instance, many therapists believe strongly in the unconscious and the impact of

The Cognitive Revolution
Behaviorism’s emphasis on objectivity and focus on external behavior had pulled psychologists’ attention away
from the mind for a prolonged period of time. The early work of the humanistic psychologists redirected
attention to the individual human as a whole, and as a conscious and self-aware being. By the 1950s, new
disciplinary perspectives in linguistics, neuroscience, and computer science were emerging, and these areas
revived interest in the mind as a focus of scientific inquiry. This particular perspective has come to be known
as the cognitive revolution (Miller, 2003). By 1967, Ulric Neisser published the first textbook entitled Cognitive
Psychology, which served as a core text in cognitive psychology courses around the country (Thorne & Henley,
2005).
Although no one person is entirely responsible for starting the cognitive revolution, Noam Chomsky was very
influential in the early days of this movement (Figure 1.9). Chomsky (1928–), an American linguist, was
dissatisfied with the influence that behaviorism had had on psychology. He believed that psychology’s focus on
behavior was short-sighted and that the field had to re-incorporate mental functioning into its purview if it
were to offer any meaningful contributions to understanding behavior (Miller, 2003).
FIGURE 1.9 Noam Chomsky was very influential in beginning the cognitive revolution. In 2010, this mural honoring
him was put up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (credit: Robert Moran)
European psychology had never really been as influenced by behaviorism as had American psychology; and
thus, the cognitive revolution helped reestablish lines of communication between European psychologists and
their American counterparts. Furthermore, psychologists began to cooperate with scientists in other fields,
like anthropology, linguistics, computer science, and neuroscience, among others. This interdisciplinary
approach often was referred to as the cognitive sciences, and the influence and prominence of this particular
perspective resonates in modern-day psychology (Miller, 2003).
Feminist Psychology
The science of psychology has had an impact on human wellbeing, both positive and negative. The dominant
influence of Western, White, and male academics in the early history of psychology meant that psychology
developed with the biases inherent in those individuals, which often had negative consequences for members of
society who were not White or male. Women, members of ethnic minorities in both the United States and other
countries, and individuals with sexual orientations other than straight had difficulties entering the field of
psychology and therefore influencing its development. They also suffered from the attitudes of White male
psychologists who were not immune to the nonscientific attitudes prevalent in the society in which they
DIG DEEPER

developed and worked. Until the 1960s, the science of psychology was largely a “womanless” psychology
(Crawford & Marecek, 1989), meaning that few women were able to practice psychology, so they had little
influence on what was studied. In addition, the experimental subjects of psychology were mostly men, which
resulted from underlying assumptions that gender had no influence on psychology and that women were not of
sufficient interest to study.
An article by Naomi Weisstein, first published in 1968 (Weisstein, 1993), stimulated a feminist revolution in
psychology by presenting a critique of psychology as a science. She also specifically criticized male psychologists
for constructing the psychology of women entirely out of their own cultural biases and without careful
experimental tests to verify any of their characterizations of women. Weisstein used, as examples, statements by
prominent psychologists in the 1960s, such as this quote by Bruno Bettleheim: “We must start with the
realization that, as much as women want to be good scientists or engineers, they want first and foremost to be
womanly companions of men and to be mothers.” Weisstein’s critique formed the foundation for the subsequent
development of a feminist psychology that attempted to be free of the influence of male cultural biases on our
knowledge of the psychology of women.
Crawford & Marecek (1989) identify several feminist approaches to psychology that can be described as feminist
psychology. These include re-evaluating and discovering the contributions of women to the history of psychology,
studying psychological gender differences, and questioning the male bias present across the practice of the
scientific approach to knowledge.
Multicultural And Cross-Cultural Psychology
Culture impacts individuals, groups, and society. An ongoing issue researchers are trying to correct is that
certain populations have been over-studied and the results of these studies have been applied to other
populations. For example, Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan discuss how WEIRD societies have been
overstudied and the results have been wrongly applied to non-WEIRD societies (2010). WEIRD stands for
western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic. Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan found that there are
many differences between people in the WEIRD group and people in less industrialized, less urban, and non-
Western societies. These differences occur in a variety of areas, including perception, cooperation, and moral
reasoning. That is, people vary depending on their culture and environment. Multicultural psychologists
develop theories and conduct research with diverse populations, typically within one country. Cross-cultural
psychologists compare populations across countries, such as participants from the United States compared to
participants from China.
In 1920, Francis Cecil Sumner was the first African American to receive a PhD in psychology in the United
States. Sumner established a psychology degree program at Howard University, leading to the education of a
new generation of African American psychologists (Black, Spence, and Omari, 2004). Much of the work of early
psychologists from diverse backgrounds was dedicated to challenging intelligence testing and promoting
innovative educational methods for children. George I. Sanchez contested such testing with Mexican American
children. As a psychologist of Mexican heritage, he pointed out that the language and cultural barriers in
testing were keeping children from equal opportunities (Guthrie, 1998). By 1940, he was teaching with his
doctoral degree at University of Texas at Austin and challenging segregated educational practices (Romo,
1986).
Two famous African American researchers and psychologists are Mamie Phipps Clark and her husband,
Kenneth Clark. They are best known for their studies conducted on African American children and doll
preference, research that was instrumental in the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court desegregation
case. The Clarks applied their research to social services and opened the first child guidance center in Harlem
(American Psychological Association, 2019).

The American Psychological Association has several ethnically based organizations for professional
psychologists that facilitate interactions among members. Since psychologists belonging to specific ethnic
groups or cultures have the most interest in studying the psychology of their communities, these organizations
provide an opportunity for the growth of research on the interplay between culture and psychology.
WOMEN IN PSYCHOLOGY
Although rarely given credit, women have been contributing to psychology since its inception as a field of
study. In 1894, Margaret Floy Washburn was the first woman awarded the doctoral degree in psychology. She
wrote The Animal Mind: A Textbook of Comparative Psychology, and it was the standard in the field for over 20
years. In the mid 1890s, Mary Whiton Calkins completed all requirements toward the PhD in psychology, but
Harvard University refused to award her that degree because she was a woman. She had been taught and
mentored by William James, who tried and failed to convince Harvard to award her the doctoral degree. Her
memory research studied primacy and recency (Madigan & O’Hara, 1992), and she also wrote about how
structuralism and functionalism both explained self-psychology (Calkins, 1906).
Another influential woman, Mary Cover Jones, conducted a study she considered to be a sequel to John B.
Watson’s study of Little Albert (you’ll learn about this study in the chapter on Learning). Jones unconditioned
fear in Little Peter, who had been afraid of rabbits (Jones, 1924).
Ethnic minority women contributing to the field of psychology include Martha Bernal and Inez Beverly Prosser;
their studies were related to education. Bernal, the first Latina to earn her doctoral degree in psychology
(1962) conducted much of her research with Mexican American children. Prosser was the first African
American woman awarded the PhD in 1933 at the University of Cincinnati (Benjamin, Henry, & McMahon,
2005).
1.3 Contemporary Psychology
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Appreciate the diversity of interests and foci within psychology
• Understand basic interests and applications in each of the described areas of psychology
• Demonstrate familiarity with some of the major concepts or important figures in each of the described areas of
psychology
Contemporary psychology is a diverse field that is influenced by all of the historical perspectives described in
the preceding section. Reflective of the discipline’s diversity is the diversity seen within the American
Psychological Association (APA). The APA is a professional organization representing psychologists in the
United States. The APA is the largest organization of psychologists in the world, and its mission is to advance
and disseminate psychological knowledge for the betterment of people. There are 54 divisions within the APA,
representing a wide variety of specialties that range from Societies for the Psychology of Religion and
Spirituality to Exercise and Sport Psychology to Behavioral Neuroscience and Comparative Psychology.
Reflecting the diversity of the field of psychology itself, members, affiliate members, and associate members
span the spectrum from students to doctoral-level psychologists, and come from a variety of places including
educational settings, criminal justice, hospitals, the armed forces, and industry (American Psychological
Association, 2014). G. Stanley Hall was the first president of the APA. Before he earned his doctoral degree, he
was an adjunct instructor at Wilberforce University, a historically Black college/university (HBCU), while
serving as faculty at Antioch College. Hall went on to work under William James, earning his PhD. Eventually,

he became the first president of Clark University in Massachusetts when it was founded (Pickren & Rutherford,
2010).
The Association for Psychological Science (APS) was founded in 1988 and seeks to advance the scientific
orientation of psychology. Its founding resulted from disagreements between members of the scientific and
clinical branches of psychology within the APA. The APS publishes five research journals and engages in
education and advocacy with funding agencies. A significant proportion of its members are international,
although the majority is located in the United States. Other organizations provide networking and
collaboration opportunities for professionals of several ethnic or racial groups working in psychology, such as
the National Latina/o Psychological Association (NLPA), the Asian American Psychological Association (AAPA),
the Association of Black Psychologists (ABPsi), and the Society of Indian Psychologists (SIP). Most of these
groups are also dedicated to studying psychological and social issues within their specific communities.
This section will provide an overview of the major subdivisions within psychology today in the order in which
they are introduced throughout the remainder of this textbook. This is not meant to be an exhaustive listing,
but it will provide insight into the major areas of research and practice of modern-day psychologists.

Biopsychology and Evolutionary Psychology
As the name suggests, biopsychology explores how our biology influences our behavior. While biological
psychology is a broad field, many biological psychologists want to understand how the structure and function
of the nervous system is related to behavior (Figure 1.10). As such, they often combine the research strategies
of both psychologists and physiologists to accomplish this goal (as discussed in Carlson, 2013).
FIGURE 1.10 Biological psychologists study how the structure and function of the nervous system generate
behavior.
The research interests of biological psychologists span a number of domains, including but not limited to,
1.3 • Contemporary Psychology 19
sensory and motor systems, sleep, drug use and abuse, ingestive behavior, reproductive behavior,
neurodevelopment, plasticity of the nervous system, and biological correlates of psychological disorders.
Given the broad areas of interest falling under the purview of biological psychology, it will probably come as no
surprise that individuals from all sorts of backgrounds are involved in this research, including biologists,
medical professionals, physiologists, and chemists. This interdisciplinary approach is often referred to as
neuroscience, of which biological psychology is a component (Carlson, 2013).
While biopsychology typically focuses on the immediate causes of behavior based in the physiology of a
human or other animal, evolutionary psychology seeks to study the ultimate biological causes of behavior. To
the extent that a behavior is impacted by genetics, a behavior, like any anatomical characteristic of a human or
animal, will demonstrate adaption to its surroundings. These surroundings include the physical environment
and, since interactions between organisms can be important to survival and reproduction, the social
environment. The study of behavior in the context of evolution has its origins with Charles Darwin, the co-
discoverer of the theory of evolution by natural selection. Darwin was well aware that behaviors should be
adaptive and wrote books titled, The Descent of Man (1871) and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and
Animals (1872), to explore this field.
Evolutionary psychology, and specifically, the evolutionary psychology of humans, has enjoyed a resurgence in
recent decades. To be subject to evolution by natural selection, a behavior must have a significant genetic
cause. In general, we expect all human cultures to express a behavior if it is caused genetically, since the
genetic differences among human groups are small. The approach taken by most evolutionary psychologists is
to predict the outcome of a behavior in a particular situation based on evolutionary theory and then to make
observations, or conduct experiments, to determine whether the results match the theory. It is important to
recognize that these types of studies are not strong evidence that a behavior is adaptive, since they lack
information that the behavior is in some part genetic and not entirely cultural (Endler, 1986). Demonstrating
that a trait, especially in humans, is naturally selected is extraordinarily difficult; perhaps for this reason,
some evolutionary psychologists are content to assume the behaviors they study have genetic determinants
(Confer et al., 2010).
One other drawback of evolutionary psychology is that the traits that we possess now evolved under
environmental and social conditions far back in human history, and we have a poor understanding of what
these conditions were. This makes predictions about what is adaptive for a behavior difficult. Behavioral traits
need not be adaptive under current conditions, only under the conditions of the past when they evolved, about
which we can only hypothesize.
There are many areas of human behavior for which evolution can make predictions. Examples include
memory, mate choice, relationships between kin, friendship and cooperation, parenting, social organization,
and status (Confer et al., 2010).
Evolutionary psychologists have had success in finding experimental correspondence between observations
and expectations. In one example, in a study of mate preference differences between men and women that
spanned 37 cultures, Buss (1989) found that women valued earning potential factors greater than men, and
men valued potential reproductive factors (youth and attractiveness) greater than women in their prospective
mates. In general, the predictions were in line with the predictions of evolution, although there were deviations
in some cultures.
Sensation and Perception
Scientists interested in both physiological aspects of sensory systems as well as in the psychological
experience of sensory information work within the area of sensation and perception (Figure 1.11). As such,
sensation and perception research is also quite interdisciplinary. Imagine walking between buildings as you
move from one class to another. You are inundated with sights, sounds, touch sensations, and smells. You also
experience the temperature of the air around you and maintain your balance as you make your way. These are

While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember what he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is associated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend’s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John Nash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would tell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended for him. He also began to hear voices in his head that he could not control. When he tried to stop them, they would come back to him, and when he did not want them to, the voices would leave him (Wearing, n.d.). These are just a few of the many examples of how people experience the world around them in ways that are unpredictable and difficult to understand. In this chapter, we will explore what psychology is, what it is not, and how it has evolved over time. We will also look at some common misconceptions about psychology. Finally, we will discuss some careers in psychology and the role that psychology plays in our lives. 2. WHAT IS PSYCHOLOGY? The word “psychology” comes from two Greek words, “psyche” and “logos,” which mean “mind” or “thinking.” Psychologists are interested in how the mind works and how we think and feel. They study the mental processes that occur in the brain, such as perception, attention, memory, thinking, problem solving, emotion, motivation, learning, decision making, self-regulation, personality, social behavior, etc. Psychologists use a variety of methods to study these processes, including observation, experiments, surveys, interviews, questionnaires, brain imaging, neuropsychology, cognitive neuroscience, psychometrics, clinical psychology, developmental psychology, ethnopsychology and social psychology. Psychology has a long and rich history. It has been practiced for thousands of years in many different cultures and societies. For example, in ancient Greece, Plato and Aristotle studied psychology in order to understand the nature of human beings and their relationships with each other and with their environment. In the Middle Ages, Christian theologians and philosophers used psychology as a tool for understanding the nature of God and his relationship with his creatures. During the Renaissance, scientists and thinkers such as Galileo Galilei, Isaac Newton, René Descartes, John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Auguste Comte, Jean-Paul Sartre, Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, William James, Edward Thorndike, B.F. Skinner and others developed theories of psychology that continue to shape our understanding of this field today. Today, psychology is a broad and diverse field that encompasses a wide range of subfields and disciplines. Some of these disciplines include: • Clinical psychology: This field focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders, as well as","{""sections"": [""Introduction to Psychology/Contemporary Psychology"", ""Introduction to Psychology""], ""pages"": [""20"", ""21"", ""30""]}"

On Monday, September 16, 2013, a gunman killed 12 people as the workday began at the
Washington Navy Yard in Washington, DC. Aaron Alexis, 34, had a troubled history: he thought that he was
being controlled by radio waves. He called the police to complain about voices in his head and being under
surveillance by “shadowy forces” (Thomas, Levine, Date, & Cloherty, 2013). While Alexis’s actions cannot be
excused, it is clear that he had some form of mental illness. Mental illness is not necessarily a cause of
violence; it is far more likely that the mentally ill will be victims rather than perpetrators of violence (Stuart,
2003). If, however, Alexis had received the help he needed, this tragedy might have been averted.

15.1 What Are Psychological Disorders?
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Understand the problems inherent in defining the concept of psychological disorder
• Describe what is meant by harmful dysfunction
• Identify the formal criteria that thoughts, feelings, and behaviors must meet to be considered abnormal and,
thus, symptomatic of a psychological disorder
According to the American Psychiatric Association, a psychological disorder, or mental disorder, is “a
syndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotion regulation,
or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological, or developmental processes underlying
mental functioning. Mental disorders are usually associated with significant distress in social, occupational, or
other important activities” (2013). Psychopathology is the study of psychological disorders, including their
symptoms, etiology (i.e., their causes), and treatment. The term psychopathology can also refer to the
manifestation of a psychological disorder. Although consensus can be difficult, it is extremely important for
mental health professionals to agree on what kinds of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are truly abnormal in
the sense that they genuinely indicate the presence of psychopathology. Certain patterns of behavior and inner
experience can easily be labeled as abnormal and clearly signify some kind of psychological disturbance. The
person who washes their hands 40 times per day and the person who claims to hear the voices of demons
exhibit behaviors and inner experiences that most would regard as abnormal: beliefs and behaviors that
suggest the existence of a psychological disorder. But, consider the nervousness a young man feels when
talking to an attractive person or the loneliness and longing for home a first-year student experiences during
her first semester of college—these feelings may not be regularly present, but they fall in the range of normal.
So, what kinds of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors represent a true psychological disorder? Psychologists work
to distinguish psychological disorders from inner experiences and behaviors that are merely situational,
idiosyncratic, or unconventional.
Mental health issues are often incorrectly viewed as less important than physical illnesses, and sometimes
people are blamed or otherwise stigmatized for their condition. People with mental illnesses did not choose or
create their illness, and cannot simply manage it through positive thinking or other attitudinal changes.
Diagnosis, treatment, and support are all necessary, and all must be considered with respect and sensitivity to
the extremely challenging nature of mental illness. While not everyone experiencing difficulty has a
psychological disorder, mental health is critical to our ability to function in our relationships, education, and
work. It is important that people talk with qualified professionals if they are having persistent feelings or
experiences in line with the descriptions below; the discussion may or may not lead to a diagnosis, but as with
physical illnesses, one has a better chance at success if they raise the issues with doctors or other experts.
Definition of a Psychological Disorder
Perhaps the simplest approach to conceptualizing psychological disorders is to label behaviors, thoughts, and
inner experiences that are atypical, distressful, dysfunctional, and sometimes even dangerous, as signs of a
disorder. For example, if you ask a classmate for a date and you are rejected, you probably would feel a little
dejected. Such feelings would be normal. If you felt extremely depressed—so much so that you lost interest in
activities, had difficulty eating or sleeping, felt utterly worthless, and contemplated suicide—your feelings
would be atypical, would deviate from the norm, and could signify the presence of a psychological disorder.
Just because something is atypical, however, does not necessarily mean it is disordered.
For example, only about 4% of people in the United States have red hair, so red hair is considered an atypical
characteristic (Figure 15.2), but it is not considered disordered, it’s just unusual. And it is less unusual in
Scotland, where approximately 13% of the population has red hair (“DNA Project Aims,” 2012). As you will
learn, some disorders, although not exactly typical, are far from atypical, and the rates in which they appear in
the population are surprisingly high.

Cross are three natural redheads. (credit a: modification of work by Richard Goldschmidt; credit b: modification of
work by Glyn Lowe; credit c: modification of work by Kirk Weaver)
If we can agree that merely being atypical is an insufficient criterion for a having a psychological disorder, is it
reasonable to consider behavior or inner experiences that differ from widely expected cultural values or
expectations as disordered? Using this criterion, a person who walks around a subway platform wearing a
heavy winter coat in July while screaming obscenities at strangers may be considered as exhibiting symptoms
of a psychological disorder. Their actions and clothes violate socially accepted rules governing appropriate
dress and behavior; these characteristics are atypical.
Cultural Expectations
Violating cultural expectations is not, in and of itself, a satisfactory means of identifying the presence of a
psychological disorder. Since behavior varies from one culture to another, what may be expected and
considered appropriate in one culture may not be viewed as such in other cultures. For example, returning a
stranger’s smile is expected in the United States because a pervasive social norm dictates that we reciprocate
friendly gestures. A person who refuses to acknowledge such gestures might be considered socially
awkward—perhaps even disordered—for violating this expectation. However, such expectations are not
universally shared. Cultural expectations in Japan involve showing reserve, restraint, and a concern for
maintaining privacy around strangers. Japanese people are generally unresponsive to smiles from strangers
(Patterson et al., 2007). Eye contact provides another example. In the United States and Europe, eye contact
with others typically signifies honesty and attention. However, most Latin-American, Asian, and African
cultures interpret direct eye contact as rude, confrontational, and aggressive (Pazain, 2010). Thus, someone
who makes eye contact with you could be considered appropriate and respectful or brazen and offensive,
depending on your culture (Figure 15.3).

to be exposed to and victims of violence than males of other races (Kilpatrick, Badour, & Resnick, 2017). A
2012 study found that 27% of corrections officers reported experiencing symptoms of PTSD in the past 30
days. Rates were higher for males (31%) than females (22%) (Spinaris, Denhof, & Kellaway, 2012). A study
conducted by Jaegers et al (2019) found that 53.4% of jail correctional officers screened positively for PTSD.
PTSD is more prevalent in prison populations than in the general public, with prevalence estimates of 6% in
male prisoners and 21% in female prisoners (Facer-Irwin et al, 2019). Factors that increase the risk of PTSD
include female gender, low socioeconomic status, low intelligence, personal history of mental disorders,
history of childhood adversity (abuse or other trauma during childhood), and family history of mental
disorders (Brewin et al., 2000). Personality characteristics such as neuroticism and somatization (the tendency
to experience physical symptoms when one encounters stress) have been shown to elevate the risk of PTSD
(Bramsen, Dirkzwager, & van der Ploeg, 2000). People who experience childhood adversity and/or traumatic
experiences during adulthood are at significantly higher risk of developing PTSD if they possess one or two
short versions of a gene that regulates the neurotransmitter serotonin (Xie et al., 2009). This suggests a
possible diathesis-stress interpretation of PTSD: its development is influenced by the interaction of
psychosocial and biological factors.
Support For Sufferers of PTSD
Research has shown that social support following a traumatic event can reduce the likelihood of PTSD (Ozer,
Best, Lipsey, & Weiss, 2003). Social support is often defined as the comfort, advice, and assistance received
from relatives, friends, and neighbors. Social support can help individuals cope during difficult times by
allowing them to discuss feelings and experiences and providing a sense of being loved and appreciated. A
14-year study of 1,377 people who had served in the Vietnam War found that those who perceived less social
support when they came home were more likely to develop PTSD than were those who perceived greater
support (Figure 15.14). In addition, those who became involved in the community were less likely to develop
PTSD, and they were more likely to experience a remission of PTSD than were those who were less involved
(Koenen, Stellman, Stellman, & Sommer, 2003).

social support decreases the risk of PTSD. This person stands at the Vietnam Traveling Memorial Wall. (credit: Kevin
Stanchfield)
Learning and the Development of PTSD
PTSD learning models suggest that some symptoms are developed and maintained through classical
conditioning. The traumatic event may act as an unconditioned stimulus that elicits an unconditioned
response characterized by extreme fear and anxiety. Cognitive, emotional, physiological, and environmental
cues accompanying or related to the event are conditioned stimuli. These traumatic reminders evoke
conditioned responses (extreme fear and anxiety) similar to those caused by the event itself (Nader, 2001). A
person who witnessed or experienced a plane crash and who developed PTSD may display excessive
hypervigilance and distress when planes fly overhead; this behavior constitutes a conditioned response to the
traumatic reminder (conditioned stimulus of the sight and sound of an airplane). Differences in how
conditionable individuals are help to explain differences in the development and maintenance of PTSD
symptoms (Pittman, 1988). Conditioning studies demonstrate facilitated acquisition of conditioned responses
and delayed extinction of conditioned responses in people with PTSD (Orr et al., 2000).
Cognitive factors are important in the development and maintenance of PTSD. One model suggests that two
key processes are crucial: disturbances in memory for the event, and negative appraisals of the trauma and its
aftermath (Ehlers & Clark, 2000). According to this theory, some people who experience traumas do not form
coherent memories of the trauma; memories of the traumatic event are poorly encoded and, thus, are
fragmented, disorganized, and lacking in detail. Therefore, these individuals are unable remember the event
in a way that gives it meaning and context. A rape victim who cannot coherently remember the event may
remember only bits and pieces (e.g., the attacker repeating a word or insult); because the victim was unable to
develop a fully integrated memory, the fragmentary memory tends to stand out. Although unable to retrieve a
complete memory of the event, the victim may be haunted by intrusive fragments involuntarily triggered by
stimuli associated with the event (e.g., memories of the attacker’s comments when encountering a person who
resembles the attacker). This interpretation fits previously discussed material concerning PTSD and
conditioning. The model also proposes that negative appraisals of the event (“I deserved to be raped because
I’m stupid”) may lead to dysfunctional behavioral strategies (e.g., avoiding social activities where men are
likely to be present) that maintain PTSD symptoms by preventing both a change in the nature of the memory
and a change in the problematic appraisals.
15.7 Mood and Related Disorders
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Distinguish normal states of sadness and euphoria from states of depression and mania
• Describe the symptoms of major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder
• Understand the differences between major depressive disorder and persistent depressive disorder, and identify
two subtypes of depression
• Define the criteria for a manic episode
• Understand genetic, biological, and psychological explanations of major depressive disorder
• Discuss the relationship between mood disorders and suicidal ideation, as well as factors associated with
suicide
Blake cries all day and feeling that he is worthless and his life is hopeless, he cannot get out of bed. Crystal
stays up all night, talks very rapidly, and went on a shopping spree in which she spent $3,000 on furniture,
although she cannot afford it. Maria recently had a baby, and she feels overwhelmed, teary, anxious, and
panicked, and believes she is a terrible mother—practically every day since the baby was born. All these
individuals demonstrate symptoms of a potential mood disorder.
Mood disorders (Figure 15.15) are characterized by severe disturbances in mood and emotions—most often
560 15 • Psychological Disorders

depression, but also mania and elation (Rothschild, 1999). All of us experience fluctuations in our moods and
emotional states, and often these fluctuations are caused by events in our lives. We become elated if our
favorite team wins the World Series and dejected if a romantic relationship ends or if we lose our job. At times,
we feel fantastic or miserable for no clear reason. People with mood disorders also experience mood
fluctuations, but their fluctuations are extreme, distort their outlook on life, and impair their ability to
function.
FIGURE 15.15 Mood disorders are characterized by massive disruptions in mood. Symptoms can range from the
extreme sadness and hopelessness of depression to the extreme elation and irritability of mania. (credit: Kiran
Foster)
The DSM-5 lists two general categories of mood disorders. Depressive disorders are a group of disorders in
which depression is the main feature. Depression is a vague term that, in everyday language, refers to an
intense and persistent sadness. Depression is a heterogeneous mood state—it consists of a broad spectrum of
symptoms that range in severity. Depressed people feel sad, discouraged, and hopeless. These individuals lose
interest in activities once enjoyed, often experience a decrease in drives such as hunger and sex, and
frequently doubt personal worth. Depressive disorders vary by degree, but this chapter highlights the most
well-known: major depressive disorder (sometimes called unipolar depression).
Bipolar and related disorders are a group of disorders in which mania is the defining feature. Mania is a state
of extreme elation and agitation. When people experience mania, they may become extremely talkative,
behave recklessly, or attempt to take on many tasks simultaneously. The most recognized of these disorders is
bipolar disorder.
Major Depressive Disorder
According to the DSM-5, the defining symptoms of major depressive disorder include “depressed mood most
of the day, nearly every day” (feeling sad, empty, hopeless, or appearing tearful to others), and loss of interest
and pleasure in usual activities (APA, 2013). In addition to feeling overwhelmingly sad most of each day,
people with depression will no longer show interest or enjoyment in activities that previously were gratifying,
such as hobbies, sports, sex, social events, time spent with family, and so on. Friends and family members may
notice that the person has completely abandoned previously enjoyed hobbies; for example, an avid tennis
player who develops major depressive disorder no longer plays tennis (Rothschild, 1999).
To receive a diagnosis of major depressive disorder, one must experience a total of five symptoms for at least a
two-week period; these symptoms must cause significant distress or impair normal functioning, and they
must not be caused by substances or a medical condition. At least one of the two symptoms mentioned above
15.7 • Mood and Related Disorders 561
must be present, plus any combination of the following symptoms (APA, 2013):
• significant weight loss (when not dieting) or weight gain and/or significant decrease or increase in
appetite;
• difficulty falling asleep or sleeping too much;
• psychomotor agitation (the person is noticeably fidgety and jittery, demonstrated by behaviors like the
inability to sit, pacing, hand-wringing, pulling or rubbing of the skin, clothing, or other objects) or
psychomotor retardation (the person talks and moves slowly, for example, talking softly, very little, or in a
monotone);
• fatigue or loss of energy;
• feelings of worthlessness or guilt;
• difficulty concentrating and indecisiveness; and
• suicidal ideation: thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), thinking about or planning suicide, or making
an actual suicide attempt.
Major depressive disorder is considered episodic: its symptoms are typically present at their full magnitude
for a certain period of time and then gradually abate. Approximately 50%–60% of people who experience an
episode of major depressive disorder will have a second episode at some point in the future; those who have
had two episodes have a 70% chance of having a third episode, and those who have had three episodes have a
90% chance of having a fourth episode (Rothschild, 1999). Although the episodes can last for months, a
majority of people diagnosed with this condition (around 70%) recover within a year. However, a substantial
number do not recover; around 12% show serious signs of impairment associated with major depressive
disorder after 5 years (Boland & Keller, 2009). In the long-term, many who do recover will still show minor
symptoms that fluctuate in their severity (Judd, 2012).
Results of Major Depressive Disorder
Major depressive disorder is a serious and incapacitating condition that can have a devastating effect on the
quality of one’s life. The person suffering from this disorder lives a profoundly miserable existence that often
results in unavailability for work or education, abandonment of promising careers, and lost wages;
occasionally, the condition requires hospitalization. The majority of those with major depressive disorder
report having faced some kind of discrimination, and many report that having received such treatment has
stopped them from initiating close relationships, applying for jobs for which they are qualified, and applying
for education or training (Lasalvia et al., 2013). Major depressive disorder also takes a toll on health.
Depression is a risk factor for the development of heart disease in healthy patients, as well as adverse
cardiovascular outcomes in patients with preexisting heart disease (Whooley, 2006).
Risk Factors for Major Depressive Disorder
Major depressive disorder is often referred to as the common cold of psychiatric disorders. Around 6.6% of the
U.S. population experiences major depressive disorder each year; 16.9% will experience the disorder during
their lifetime (Kessler & Wang, 2009). It is more common among women than among men, affecting
approximately 20% of women and 13% of men at some point in their life (National Comorbidity Survey, 2007).
The greater risk among women is not accounted for by a tendency to report symptoms or to seek help more
readily, suggesting that gender differences in the rates of major depressive disorder may reflect biological and
gender-related environmental experiences (Kessler, 2003).
Lifetime rates of major depressive disorder tend to be highest in North and South America, Europe, and
Australia; they are considerably lower in Asian countries (Hasin, Fenton, & Weissman, 2011). The rates of
major depressive disorder are higher among younger age cohorts than among older cohorts, perhaps because
people in younger age cohorts are more willing to admit depression (Kessler & Wang, 2009).
A number of risk factors are associated with major depressive disorder: unemployment (including
homemakers); earning less than $20,000 per year; living in urban areas; or being separated, divorced, or
562 15 • Psychological Disorders

widowed (Hasin et al., 2011). Comorbid disorders include anxiety disorders and substance abuse disorders
(Kessler & Wang, 2009).
Subtypes of Depression
The DSM-5 lists several different subtypes of depression. These subtypes—what the DSM-5 refer to as
specifiers—are not specific disorders; rather, they are labels used to indicate specific patterns of symptoms or
to specify certain periods of time in which the symptoms may be present. One subtype, seasonal pattern,
applies to situations in which a person experiences the symptoms of major depressive disorder only during a
particular time of year (e.g., fall or winter). In everyday language, people often refer to this subtype as the
winter blues.
Another subtype, peripartum onset (commonly referred to as postpartum depression), applies to women who
experience major depression during pregnancy or in the four weeks following the birth of their child (APA,
2013). These women often feel very anxious and may even have panic attacks. They may feel guilty, agitated,
and be weepy. They may not want to hold or care for their newborn, even in cases in which the pregnancy was
desired and intended. In extreme cases, the mother may have feelings of wanting to harm her child or herself.
In a horrific illustration, a woman named Andrea Yates, who suffered from extreme peripartum-onset
depression (as well as other mental illnesses), drowned her five children in a bathtub (Roche, 2002). Most
women with peripartum-onset depression do not physically harm their children, but most do have difficulty
being adequate caregivers (Fields, 2010). A surprisingly high number of women experience symptoms of
peripartum-onset depression. A study of 10,000 women who had recently given birth found that 14% screened
positive for peripartum-onset depression, and that nearly 20% reported having thoughts of wanting to harm
themselves (Wisner et al., 2013).
People with persistent depressive disorder (previously known as dysthymia) experience depressed moods
most of the day nearly every day for at least two years, as well as at least two of the other symptoms of major
depressive disorder. People with persistent depressive disorder are chronically sad and melancholy, but do not
meet all the criteria for major depression. However, episodes of full-blown major depressive disorder can
occur during persistent depressive disorder (APA, 2013).
Bipolar Disorder
A person with bipolar disorder (commonly known as manic depression) often experiences mood states that
vacillate between depression and mania; that is, the person’s mood is said to alternate from one emotional
extreme to the other (in contrast to unipolar, which indicates a persistently sad mood).
To be diagnosed with bipolar disorder, a person must have experienced a manic episode at least once in their
life; although major depressive episodes are common in bipolar disorder, they are not required for a diagnosis
(APA, 2013). According to the DSM-5, a manic episode is characterized as a “distinct period of abnormally and
persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or
energy lasting at least one week,” that lasts most of the time each day (APA, 2013, p. 124). During a manic
episode, some experience a mood that is almost euphoric and become excessively talkative, sometimes
spontaneously starting conversations with strangers; others become excessively irritable and complain or
make hostile comments. The person may talk loudly and rapidly, exhibiting flight of ideas, abruptly switching
from one topic to another. These individuals are easily distracted, which can make a conversation very
difficult. They may exhibit grandiosity, in which they experience inflated but unjustified self-esteem and self-
confidence. For example, they might quit a job in order to “strike it rich” in the stock market, despite lacking
the knowledge, experience, and capital for such an endeavor. They may take on several tasks at the same time
(e.g., several time-consuming projects at work) and yet show little, if any, need for sleep; some may go for days
without sleep. Patients may also recklessly engage in pleasurable activities that could have harmful
consequences, including spending sprees, reckless driving, making foolish investments, excessive gambling,
or engaging in sexual encounters with strangers (APA, 2013).

Those with antisocial tendencies do not seem to experience emotions the way most other people do. These
individuals fail to show fear in response to environment cues that signal punishment, pain, or noxious
stimulation. For instance, they show less skin conductance (sweatiness on hands) in anticipation of electric
shock than do people without antisocial tendencies (Hare, 1965). Skin conductance is controlled by the
sympathetic nervous system and is used to assess autonomic nervous system functioning. When the
sympathetic nervous system is active, people become aroused and anxious, and sweat gland activity increases.
Thus, increased sweat gland activity, as assessed through skin conductance, is taken as a sign of arousal or
anxiety. For those with antisocial personality disorder, a lack of skin conductance may indicate the presence of
characteristics such as emotional deficits and impulsivity that underlie the propensity for antisocial behavior
and negative social relationships (Fung et al., 2005).
Another example showing that those with antisocial personality disorder fail to respond to environmental cues
comes from a recent study by Stuppy-Sullivan and Baskin-Sommers (2019). The researchers studied cognitive
and reward factors associated with antisocial personality disorder dysfunction in 119 incarcerated males.
15.11 • Personality Disorders 587
Each subject was administered three tasks targeting different aspects of cognition and reward. High-
magnitude rewards tended to impair perception in those with antisocial personality disorder, worsened
executive function when they were consciously aware of the high rewards, and worsened inhibition when the
tasks placed high demand on working memory.

Summary
15.1 What Are Psychological Disorders?
Psychological disorders are conditions characterized by abnormal thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Although
challenging, it is essential for psychologists and mental health professionals to agree on what kinds of inner
experiences and behaviors constitute the presence of a psychological disorder. Inner experiences and
behaviors that are atypical or violate social norms could signify the presence of a disorder; however, each of
these criteria alone is inadequate. Harmful dysfunction describes the view that psychological disorders result
from the inability of an internal mechanism to perform its natural function. Many of the features of harmful
dysfunction conceptualization have been incorporated in the APA’s formal definition of psychological
disorders. According to this definition, the presence of a psychological disorder is signaled by significant
disturbances in thoughts, feelings, and behaviors; these disturbances must reflect some kind of dysfunction
(biological, psychological, or developmental), must cause significant impairment in one’s life, and must not
reflect culturally expected reactions to certain life events.
15.2 Diagnosing and Classifying Psychological Disorders
The diagnosis and classification of psychological disorders is essential in studying and treating
psychopathology. The classification system used by most U.S. professionals is the DSM-5. The first edition of
the DSM was published in 1952, and has undergone numerous revisions. The 5th and most recent edition, the
DSM-5, was published in 2013. The diagnostic manual includes a total of 237 specific diagnosable disorders,
each described in detail, including its symptoms, prevalence, risk factors, and comorbidity. Over time, the
number of diagnosable conditions listed in the DSM has grown steadily, prompting criticism from some.
Nevertheless, the diagnostic criteria in the DSM are more explicit than that of any other system, which makes
the DSM system highly desirable for both clinical diagnosis and research.

About Psychology 2e
Psychology 2e is designed to meet scope and sequence requirements for the single-semester introduction to
psychology course. The book offers a comprehensive treatment of core concepts, grounded in both classic
Preface 1
studies and current and emerging research. The text also includes coverage of the DSM-5 in examinations of
psychological disorders. Psychology 2e incorporates discussions that reflect the diversity within the discipline,
as well as the diversity of cultures and communities across the globe.
Coverage and scope
The first edition of Psychology has been used by thousands of faculty and hundreds of thousands of students
since its publication in 2015. OpenStax mined our adopters’ extensive and helpful feedback to identify the
most significant revision needs while maintaining the organization that many instructors had incorporated
into their courses. Specific surveys, pre-revision reviews, and customization analysis, as well as analytical data
from OpenStax partners and online learning environments, all aided in planning the revision.
The result is a book that thoroughly treats psychology’s foundational concepts while adding current and
meaningful coverage in specific areas. Psychology 2e retains its manageable scope and contains ample
features to draw learners into the discipline.
Structurally, the textbook remains similar to the first edition, with no chapter reorganization and very targeted
changes at the section level.
• Chapter 1: Introduction to Psychology
• Chapter 2: Psychological Research
• Chapter 3: Biopsychology

Changes to the Second Edition
OpenStax only undertakes second editions when significant modifications to the text are necessary. In the case
of Psychology 2e, user feedback indicated that we needed to focus on a few key areas, which we have done in
the following ways.
Content revisions for clarity, accuracy, and currency
The revision plan varied by chapter based on need. Some chapters were significantly updated for conceptual
coverage, research-informed data, and clearer language. In other chapters, the revisions focused mostly on
currency of examples and updates to statistics.
Over 210 new research references have been added or updated in order to improve the scholarly
underpinnings of the material and broaden the perspective for students. Dozens of examples and feature
boxes have been changed or added to better explain concepts and/or increase relevance for students.
Research replication and validity
To engage students in stronger critical analysis and inform them about research reproducibility, substantial
coverage has been added to the research chapter and strategically throughout the textbook whenever key
2 Preface

studies are discussed. This material is presented in a balanced way and provides instructors with ample
opportunity to discuss the importance of replication in a manner that best suits their course.
Diversity, representation, and inclusion
With the help of researchers and teachers who focus on diversity- and identity-related issues, OpenStax has
engaged in detailed diversity reviews to identify opportunities to improve the textbook. Reviewers were asked
to follow a framework to evaluate the book’s terminology, research citations, key contributors to the field,
photos and illustrations, and related aspects, commenting on the representation and consideration of diverse
groups. Significant additions and revisions were made in this regard, and the review framework itself is
available among the OpenStax Psychology 2e instructor resources.
Art and illustrations
Under the guidance of the authors and expert scientific illustrators, especially those well versed in creating
accessible art, the OpenStax team made changes throughout the art program in Psychology 2e.
Accessibility improvements
As with all OpenStax books, the first edition of Psychology was created with a focus on accessibility. We have
emphasized and improved that approach in the second edition. Our goal is to ensure that all OpenStax
websites and the web view versions of our learning materials follow accessible web design best practices, so
that they will meet the W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 at Level AA and Section 508
of the Rehabilitation Act. The WCAG 2.0 guidelines explain ways to make web content more accessible for
people with disabilities and more user-friendly for everyone.
• To accommodate users of specific assistive technologies, all alternative text was reviewed and revised for
comprehensiveness and clarity.
• All illustrations were revised to improve the color contrast, which is important for some visually impaired
students.
• Overall, the OpenStax platform has been continually upgraded to improve accessibility.
To learn more about our commitment and progress, please view our accessibility statement
(https://openstax.org/accessibility-statement).
A transition guide will be available on openstax.org to highlight the specific chapter-level changes to the
second edition.
Pedagogical foundation
Psychology 2e engages students through inquiry, self-reflection, and investigation. Features in the second
edition have been carefully updated to remain topical and relevant while deepening students’ relationship to
the material. They include the following:
• Everyday Connection features tie psychological topics to everyday issues and behaviors that students
encounter in their lives and the world. Topics include the validity of scores on college entrance exams, the
opioid crisis, the impact of social status on stress and healthcare, and cognitive mapping.
• What Do You Think? features provide research-based information and ask students their views on
controversial issues. Topics include “Brain Dead and on Life Support,” “Violent Media and Aggression,”
and “Capital Punishment and Criminals with Intellectual Disabilities.”
• Dig Deeper features discuss one specific aspect of a topic in greater depth so students can dig more
deeply into the concept. Examples include discussions on the distinction between evolutionary
psychology and behavioral genetics, recent findings on neuroplasticity, the field of forensic psychology,
and a presentation of research on strategies for coping with prejudice and discrimination.
• Connect the Concepts features revisit a concept learned in another chapter, expanding upon it within a
different context. Features include “Emotional Expression and Emotional Regulation,” “Tweens, Teens,
Preface 3
and Social Norms,” and “Conditioning and OCD.”
Art, interactives, and assessments that engage
Our art program is designed to enhance students’ understanding of psychological concepts through simple,
effective graphs, diagrams, and photographs. Psychology 2e also incorporates links to relevant interactive
exercises and animations that help bring topics to life. Selected assessment items touch directly on students’
lives.
• Link to Learning features direct students to online interactive exercises and animations that add a fuller
context to core content and provide an opportunity for application.
• Personal Application Questions engage students in topics at a personal level to encourage reflection and
promote discussion.

The Cognitive Revolution
Behaviorism’s emphasis on objectivity and focus on external behavior had pulled psychologists’ attention away
from the mind for a prolonged period of time. The early work of the humanistic psychologists redirected
attention to the individual human as a whole, and as a conscious and self-aware being. By the 1950s, new
disciplinary perspectives in linguistics, neuroscience, and computer science were emerging, and these areas
revived interest in the mind as a focus of scientific inquiry. This particular perspective has come to be known
as the cognitive revolution (Miller, 2003). By 1967, Ulric Neisser published the first textbook entitled Cognitive
Psychology, which served as a core text in cognitive psychology courses around the country (Thorne & Henley,
2005).
Although no one person is entirely responsible for starting the cognitive revolution, Noam Chomsky was very
influential in the early days of this movement (Figure 1.9). Chomsky (1928–), an American linguist, was
dissatisfied with the influence that behaviorism had had on psychology. He believed that psychology’s focus on
behavior was short-sighted and that the field had to re-incorporate mental functioning into its purview if it
were to offer any meaningful contributions to understanding behavior (Miller, 2003).
FIGURE 1.9 Noam Chomsky was very influential in beginning the cognitive revolution. In 2010, this mural honoring
him was put up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (credit: Robert Moran)
European psychology had never really been as influenced by behaviorism as had American psychology; and
thus, the cognitive revolution helped reestablish lines of communication between European psychologists and
their American counterparts. Furthermore, psychologists began to cooperate with scientists in other fields,
like anthropology, linguistics, computer science, and neuroscience, among others. This interdisciplinary
approach often was referred to as the cognitive sciences, and the influence and prominence of this particular
perspective resonates in modern-day psychology (Miller, 2003).
Feminist Psychology
The science of psychology has had an impact on human wellbeing, both positive and negative. The dominant
influence of Western, White, and male academics in the early history of psychology meant that psychology
developed with the biases inherent in those individuals, which often had negative consequences for members of
society who were not White or male. Women, members of ethnic minorities in both the United States and other
countries, and individuals with sexual orientations other than straight had difficulties entering the field of
psychology and therefore influencing its development. They also suffered from the attitudes of White male
psychologists who were not immune to the nonscientific attitudes prevalent in the society in which they
DIG DEEPER

developed and worked. Until the 1960s, the science of psychology was largely a “womanless” psychology
(Crawford & Marecek, 1989), meaning that few women were able to practice psychology, so they had little
influence on what was studied. In addition, the experimental subjects of psychology were mostly men, which
resulted from underlying assumptions that gender had no influence on psychology and that women were not of
sufficient interest to study.
An article by Naomi Weisstein, first published in 1968 (Weisstein, 1993), stimulated a feminist revolution in
psychology by presenting a critique of psychology as a science. She also specifically criticized male psychologists
for constructing the psychology of women entirely out of their own cultural biases and without careful
experimental tests to verify any of their characterizations of women. Weisstein used, as examples, statements by
prominent psychologists in the 1960s, such as this quote by Bruno Bettleheim: “We must start with the
realization that, as much as women want to be good scientists or engineers, they want first and foremost to be
womanly companions of men and to be mothers.” Weisstein’s critique formed the foundation for the subsequent
development of a feminist psychology that attempted to be free of the influence of male cultural biases on our
knowledge of the psychology of women.
Crawford & Marecek (1989) identify several feminist approaches to psychology that can be described as feminist
psychology. These include re-evaluating and discovering the contributions of women to the history of psychology,
studying psychological gender differences, and questioning the male bias present across the practice of the
scientific approach to knowledge.
Multicultural And Cross-Cultural Psychology
Culture impacts individuals, groups, and society. An ongoing issue researchers are trying to correct is that
certain populations have been over-studied and the results of these studies have been applied to other
populations. For example, Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan discuss how WEIRD societies have been
overstudied and the results have been wrongly applied to non-WEIRD societies (2010). WEIRD stands for
western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic. Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan found that there are
many differences between people in the WEIRD group and people in less industrialized, less urban, and non-
Western societies. These differences occur in a variety of areas, including perception, cooperation, and moral
reasoning. That is, people vary depending on their culture and environment. Multicultural psychologists
develop theories and conduct research with diverse populations, typically within one country. Cross-cultural
psychologists compare populations across countries, such as participants from the United States compared to
participants from China.
In 1920, Francis Cecil Sumner was the first African American to receive a PhD in psychology in the United
States. Sumner established a psychology degree program at Howard University, leading to the education of a
new generation of African American psychologists (Black, Spence, and Omari, 2004). Much of the work of early
psychologists from diverse backgrounds was dedicated to challenging intelligence testing and promoting
innovative educational methods for children. George I. Sanchez contested such testing with Mexican American
children. As a psychologist of Mexican heritage, he pointed out that the language and cultural barriers in
testing were keeping children from equal opportunities (Guthrie, 1998). By 1940, he was teaching with his
doctoral degree at University of Texas at Austin and challenging segregated educational practices (Romo,
1986).
Two famous African American researchers and psychologists are Mamie Phipps Clark and her husband,
Kenneth Clark. They are best known for their studies conducted on African American children and doll

The American Psychological Association has several ethnically based organizations for professional
psychologists that facilitate interactions among members. Since psychologists belonging to specific ethnic
groups or cultures have the most interest in studying the psychology of their communities, these organizations
provide an opportunity for the growth of research on the interplay between culture and psychology.
WOMEN IN PSYCHOLOGY
Although rarely given credit, women have been contributing to psychology since its inception as a field of
study. In 1894, Margaret Floy Washburn was the first woman awarded the doctoral degree in psychology. She
wrote The Animal Mind: A Textbook of Comparative Psychology, and it was the standard in the field for over 20
years. In the mid 1890s, Mary Whiton Calkins completed all requirements toward the PhD in psychology, but
Harvard University refused to award her that degree because she was a woman. She had been taught and
mentored by William James, who tried and failed to convince Harvard to award her the doctoral degree. Her
memory research studied primacy and recency (Madigan & O’Hara, 1992), and she also wrote about how
structuralism and functionalism both explained self-psychology (Calkins, 1906).
Another influential woman, Mary Cover Jones, conducted a study she considered to be a sequel to John B.
Watson’s study of Little Albert (you’ll learn about this study in the chapter on Learning). Jones unconditioned
fear in Little Peter, who had been afraid of rabbits (Jones, 1924).
Ethnic minority women contributing to the field of psychology include Martha Bernal and Inez Beverly Prosser;
their studies were related to education. Bernal, the first Latina to earn her doctoral degree in psychology
(1962) conducted much of her research with Mexican American children. Prosser was the first African
American woman awarded the PhD in 1933 at the University of Cincinnati (Benjamin, Henry, & McMahon,
2005).
1.3 Contemporary Psychology
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Appreciate the diversity of interests and foci within psychology
• Understand basic interests and applications in each of the described areas of psychology
• Demonstrate familiarity with some of the major concepts or important figures in each of the described areas of
psychology
Contemporary psychology is a diverse field that is influenced by all of the historical perspectives described in
the preceding section. Reflective of the discipline’s diversity is the diversity seen within the American
Psychological Association (APA). The APA is a professional organization representing psychologists in the
United States. The APA is the largest organization of psychologists in the world, and its mission is to advance
and disseminate psychological knowledge for the betterment of people. There are 54 divisions within the APA,
representing a wide variety of specialties that range from Societies for the Psychology of Religion and
Spirituality to Exercise and Sport Psychology to Behavioral Neuroscience and Comparative Psychology.
Reflecting the diversity of the field of psychology itself, members, affiliate members, and associate members
span the spectrum from students to doctoral-level psychologists, and come from a variety of places including
educational settings, criminal justice, hospitals, the armed forces, and industry (American Psychological
Association, 2014). G. Stanley Hall was the first president of the APA. Before he earned his doctoral degree, he
was an adjunct instructor at Wilberforce University, a historically Black college/university (HBCU), while
serving as faculty at Antioch College. Hall went on to work under William James, earning his PhD. Eventually,

he became the first president of Clark University in Massachusetts when it was founded (Pickren & Rutherford,
2010).
The Association for Psychological Science (APS) was founded in 1988 and seeks to advance the scientific
orientation of psychology. Its founding resulted from disagreements between members of the scientific and
clinical branches of psychology within the APA. The APS publishes five research journals and engages in
education and advocacy with funding agencies. A significant proportion of its members are international,
although the majority is located in the United States. Other organizations provide networking and
collaboration opportunities for professionals of several ethnic or racial groups working in psychology, such as
the National Latina/o Psychological Association (NLPA), the Asian American Psychological Association (AAPA),
the Association of Black Psychologists (ABPsi), and the Society of Indian Psychologists (SIP). Most of these
groups are also dedicated to studying psychological and social issues within their specific communities.
This section will provide an overview of the major subdivisions within psychology today in the order in which
they are introduced throughout the remainder of this textbook. This is not meant to be an exhaustive listing,
but it will provide insight into the major areas of research and practice of modern-day psychologists.

Biopsychology and Evolutionary Psychology
As the name suggests, biopsychology explores how our biology influences our behavior. While biological
psychology is a broad field, many biological psychologists want to understand how the structure and function
of the nervous system is related to behavior (Figure 1.10). As such, they often combine the research strategies
of both psychologists and physiologists to accomplish this goal (as discussed in Carlson, 2013).
FIGURE 1.10 Biological psychologists study how the structure and function of the nervous system generate
behavior.
The research interests of biological psychologists span a number of domains, including but not limited to,
1.3 • Contemporary Psychology 19
sensory and motor systems, sleep, drug use and abuse, ingestive behavior, reproductive behavior,
neurodevelopment, plasticity of the nervous system, and biological correlates of psychological disorders.
Given the broad areas of interest falling under the purview of biological psychology, it will probably come as no
surprise that individuals from all sorts of backgrounds are involved in this research, including biologists,
medical professionals, physiologists, and chemists. This interdisciplinary approach is often referred to as
neuroscience, of which biological psychology is a component (Carlson, 2013).
While biopsychology typically focuses on the immediate causes of behavior based in the physiology of a
human or other animal, evolutionary psychology seeks to study the ultimate biological causes of behavior. To
the extent that a behavior is impacted by genetics, a behavior, like any anatomical characteristic of a human or
animal, will demonstrate adaption to its surroundings. These surroundings include the physical environment
and, since interactions between organisms can be important to survival and reproduction, the social
environment. The study of behavior in the context of evolution has its origins with Charles Darwin, the co-
discoverer of the theory of evolution by natural selection. Darwin was well aware that behaviors should be
adaptive and wrote books titled, The Descent of Man (1871) and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and
Animals (1872), to explore this field.
Evolutionary psychology, and specifically, the evolutionary psychology of humans, has enjoyed a resurgence in
recent decades. To be subject to evolution by natural selection, a behavior must have a significant genetic
cause. In general, we expect all human cultures to express a behavior if it is caused genetically, since the
genetic differences among human groups are small. The approach taken by most evolutionary psychologists is
to predict the outcome of a behavior in a particular situation based on evolutionary theory and then to make
observations, or conduct experiments, to determine whether the results match the theory. It is important to
recognize that these types of studies are not strong evidence that a behavior is adaptive, since they lack
information that the behavior is in some part genetic and not entirely cultural (Endler, 1986). Demonstrating
that a trait, especially in humans, is naturally selected is extraordinarily difficult; perhaps for this reason,
some evolutionary psychologists are content to assume the behaviors they study have genetic determinants
(Confer et al., 2010).
One other drawback of evolutionary psychology is that the traits that we possess now evolved under
environmental and social conditions far back in human history, and we have a poor understanding of what
these conditions were. This makes predictions about what is adaptive for a behavior difficult. Behavioral traits
need not be adaptive under current conditions, only under the conditions of the past when they evolved, about
which we can only hypothesize.
There are many areas of human behavior for which evolution can make predictions. Examples include
memory, mate choice, relationships between kin, friendship and cooperation, parenting, social organization,
and status (Confer et al., 2010).
Evolutionary psychologists have had success in finding experimental correspondence between observations
and expectations. In one example, in a study of mate preference differences between men and women that
spanned 37 cultures, Buss (1989) found that women valued earning potential factors greater than men, and
men valued potential reproductive factors (youth and attractiveness) greater than women in their prospective
mates. In general, the predictions were in line with the predictions of evolution, although there were deviations
in some cultures.
Sensation and Perception
Scientists interested in both physiological aspects of sensory systems as well as in the psychological
experience of sensory information work within the area of sensation and perception (Figure 1.11). As such,
sensation and perception research is also quite interdisciplinary. Imagine walking between buildings as you
move from one class to another. You are inundated with sights, sounds, touch sensations, and smells. You also
experience the temperature of the air around you and maintain your balance as you make your way. These are

Theory X and Theory Y Management Styles
Theory X Theory Y
People dislike work and avoid it. People enjoy work and find it natural.
People avoid responsibility. People are more satisfied when given responsibility.
People want to be told what to do. People want to take part in setting their own work goals.
Goals are achieved through rules and punishments. Goals are achieved through enticements and rewards.
TABLE 13.3
Another management style was described by Donald Clifton, who focused his research on how an organization
can best use an individual’s strengths, an approach he called strengths-based management. He and his
colleagues interviewed 8,000 managers and concluded that it is important to focus on a person’s strengths, not
their weaknesses. A strength is a particular enduring talent possessed by an individual that allows them to
provide consistent, near-perfect performance in tasks involving that talent. Clifton argued that our strengths
provide the greatest opportunity for growth (Buckingham & Clifton, 2001). An example of a strength is public
speaking or the ability to plan a successful event. The strengths-based approach is very popular although its
effect on organization performance is not well-studied. However, Kaiser & Overfield (2011) found that
managers often neglected improving their weaknesses and overused their strengths, both of which interfered
with performance.
Leadership is an important element of management. Leadership styles have been of major interest within I-O
research, and researchers have proposed numerous theories of leadership. Bass (1985) popularized and
developed the concepts of transactional leadership versus transformational leadership styles. In transactional
leadership, the focus is on supervision and organizational goals, which are achieved through a system of
rewards and punishments (i.e., transactions). Transactional leaders maintain the status quo: They are
managers. This is in contrast to the transformational leader. People who have transformational leadership
possess four attributes to varying degrees: They are charismatic (highly liked role models), inspirational
(optimistic about goal attainment), intellectually stimulating (encourage critical thinking and problem
solving), and considerate (Bass, Avolio, & Atwater, 1996).
As women increasingly take on leadership roles in corporations, questions have arisen as to whether there are
differences in leadership styles between men and women (Eagly, Johannesen-Schmidt, & van Engen, 2003).
Eagly & Johnson (1990) conducted a meta-analysis to examine gender and leadership style. They found, to a
slight but significant degree, that women tend to practice an interpersonal style of leadership (i.e., she focuses
on the morale and welfare of the employees) and men practice a task-oriented style (i.e., he focuses on
accomplishing tasks). However, the differences were less pronounced when one looked only at organizational
studies and excluded laboratory experiments or surveys that did not involve actual organizational leaders.
Larger gender-related differences were observed when leadership style was categorized as democratic or
autocratic, and these differences were consistent across all types of studies. The authors suggest that
similarities between genders in leadership styles are attributable to different genders needing to conform to
the organization’s culture; additionally, they propose that gender-related differences reflect inherent
differences in the strengths each gender brings to bear on leadership practice. In another meta-analysis of
leadership style, Eagly, Johannesen-Schmidt, & van Engen (2003) found that women tended to exhibit the
characteristics of transformational leaders, while men were more likely to be transactional leaders. However,
the differences are not absolute; for example, women were found to use methods of reward for performance
more often than men, which is a component of transactional leadership. The differences they found were
472 13 • Industrial-Organizational Psychology
Access for free at openstax.org
relatively small. As Eagly, Johannesen-Schmidt, & van Engen (2003) point out, research shows that
transformational leadership approaches are more effective than transactional approaches, although individual
leaders typically exhibit elements of both approaches.
A new and emerging area of research within psychology focuses on leadership and the relationship with
leaders from the perspective of a follower. This “followership” research suggests that studies need to examine
the leader-follower relationship in both directions—instead of focusing only on leadership—to better
understand the dynamics of the relationship. Put differently, people are individuals, and because they are
different, there probably is no single best leadership-follower dynamic between leaders and followers. For
instance, think about the differences between yourself and someone you know well. Do you respond the same
way to criticism? Maybe one of you likes a lot of structure and other seems to work best with less structure.
Perhaps, one of you is ready to try a new restaurant at any time and the other prefers to go to the tried-and-true
place that you’ve visited so many times the servers know your order before you place it.
Some early research has discovered that the characteristics of individual followers will result in different types
of relationships with a leader depending on the leadership style. It appears that not all leadership styles work
well with all follower types. One characteristic of followers, for example, is their degree of extroversion.
Previous research suggests that individuals with a high degree of extroversion would need a larger amount of
interaction with their leaders in order to function well; however, other research suggests this may not
necessarily be the case and instead other factors may be at work (Phillips & Bedeian; Bauer et al, 2006).
Another characteristic of followers is their individual need for growth. For followers who have a strong desire
to learn and grow within their organization, a leader who provides developmental opportunities might be
better received than one who does not. In addition, for those followers who are low on growth and need
strength, leaders who push them to grow may make them less satisfied followers as they feel forced into
further development and training, possibly signaling a lower level of achievement from their supervisor.
Training for leaders in both helping employees who have a strong drive for growth and those who do not
appears to be helpful in improving the relationship between both types of followers and their leaders (Schyns,
Kroon, & Moors, 2008).
Finally, an employee’s need for leadership is an important component of the leader-follower relationship.
Some individuals are significantly more autonomous than others and as a result do not respond as well to
leaders who provide a lot of structure and rigidity of processes, in turn reducing the quality of their
relationship with their leader. Other employees who are high in need for leadership have a better relationship
with their leader if they are provided with a well-structured environment with clear responsibilities and little
ambiguity in their work. These followers work best in situations where they feel they can comfortably perform
the work with little requirement to think outside of the guidelines that have been provided. For these
individuals, having a leader who is able to set a clear path forward for the employee with little need for
deviation promotes a strong positive leader-follower relationship (Felfe & Schyns, 2006).
Goals, Teamwork and Work Teams
The workplace today is rapidly changing due to a variety of factors, such as shifts in technology, economics,
foreign competition, globalization, and workplace demographics. Organizations need to respond quickly to
changes in these factors. Many companies are responding to these changes by structuring their organizations
so that work can be delegated to work teams, which bring together diverse skills, experience, and expertise.
This is in contrast to organizational structures that have individuals at their base (Naquin & Tynan, 2003). In
the team-based approach, teams are brought together and given a specific task or goal to accomplish. Despite
their burgeoning popularity, team structures do not always deliver greater productivity—the work of teams is
an active area of research (Naquin & Tynan, 2003).
Why do some teams work well while others do not? There are many contributing factors. For example, teams
can mask team members that are not working (i.e., social loafing). Teams can be inefficient due to poor
13.3 • Organizational Psychology: The Social Dimension of Work 473
communication; they can have poor decision-making skills due to conformity effects; and, they can have
conflict within the group. The popularity of teams may in part result from the team halo effect: Teams are
given credit for their successes. but individuals within a team are blamed for team failures (Naquin & Tynan,
2003). One aspect of team diversity is their gender mix. Researchers have explored whether gender mix has an
effect on team performance. On the one hand, diversity can introduce communication and interpersonal-
relationship problems that hinder performance, but on the other hand diversity can also increase the team’s
skill set, which may include skills that can actually improve team member interactions. Hoogendoorn,
Oosterbeek, & van Praag (2013) studied project teams in a university business school in which the gender mix
of the teams was manipulated. They found that gender-balanced teams performed better, as measured by
sales and profits, than teams made up mostly by men. The study did not have enough data to determine the
relative performance of teams with more women than men. The study was unsuccessful in identifying which
mechanism (interpersonal relationships, learning, or skills mixes) accounted for performance improvement.
There are three basic types of teams: problem resolution teams, creative teams, and tactical teams. Problem
resolution teams are created for the purpose of solving a particular problem or issue; for example, the
diagnostic teams at the Centers for Disease Control. Creative teams are used to develop innovative possibilities
or solutions; for example, design teams for car manufacturers create new vehicle models. Tactical teams are
used to execute a well-defined plan or objective, such as a police or FBI SWAT team handling a hostage
situation (Larson & LaFasto, 1989). One area of active research involves a fourth kind of team—the virtual
team; these studies examine how groups of geographically disparate people brought together using digital
communications technology function (Powell, Piccoli, & Ives, 2004). Even before the COVID-19 pandemic,
virtual teams were more common due to the growing globalization of organizations and the use of consulting
and partnerships facilitated by digital communication.
Organizational Culture
Each company and organization has an organizational culture. Organizational culture encompasses the
values, visions, hierarchies, norms, and interactions among its employees. It is how an organization is run,
how it operates, and how it makes decisions—the industry in which the organization participates may have an
influence. Different departments within one company can develop their own subculture within the
organization’s culture. Ostroff, Kinicki, and Tamkins (2003) identify three layers in organizational culture:
observable artifacts, espoused values, and basic assumptions. Observable artifacts are the symbols, language
(jargon, slang, and humor), narratives (stories and legends), and practices (rituals) that represent the
underlying cultural assumptions. Espoused values are concepts or beliefs that the management or the entire
organization endorses. They are the rules that allow employees to know which actions they should take in
different situations and which information they should adhere to. These basic assumptions generally are
unobservable and unquestioned. Researchers have developed survey instruments to measure organizational
culture.
With the workforce being a global marketplace, your company may have a supplier in Korea and another in
Honduras and have employees in the United States, China, and South Africa. You may have coworkers of
different religious, ethnic, or racial backgrounds than yourself. Your coworkers may be from different places
around the globe. Many workplaces offer diversity training to help everyone involved bridge and understand
cultural differences. Diversity training educates participants about cultural differences with the goal of
improving teamwork. There is always the potential for prejudice between members of two groups, but the
evidence suggests that simply working together, particularly if the conditions of work are set carefully that
such prejudice can be reduced or eliminated. Pettigrew and Tropp (2006) conducted a meta-analysis to
examine the question of whether contact between groups reduced prejudice between those groups. They found
that there was a moderate but significant effect. They also found that, as previously theorized, the effect was
enhanced when the two groups met under conditions in which they have equal standing, common goals,
cooperation between the groups, and especially support on the part of the institution or authorities for the
contact.

Managing Generational Differences
An important consideration in managing employees is age. Workers’ expectations and attitudes are developed in
part by experience in particular cultural time periods. Generational constructs are somewhat arbitrary, yet they
may be helpful in setting broad directions to organizational management as one generation leaves the workforce
and another enters it. The baby boomer generation (born between 1946 and 1964) is in the process of leaving
the workforce and will continue to depart it for a decade or more. Generation X (born between the early 1960s
and the 1980s) are now in the middle of their careers. Millennials (born from 1979 to the early 1994) began to
come of age at the turn of the century, and are early in their careers.
Today, as these three different generations work side by side in the workplace, employers and managers need to
be able to identify their unique characteristics. Each generation has distinctive expectations, habits, attitudes,
and motivations (Elmore, 2010). One of the major differences among these generations is knowledge of the use
of technology in the workplace. Millennials are technologically sophisticated and believe their use of technology
sets them apart from other generations. They have also been characterized as self-centered and overly self-
confident. Their attitudinal differences have raised concerns for managers about maintaining their motivation as
employees and their ability to integrate into organizational culture created by baby boomers (Myers &
Sadaghiani, 2010). For example, millennials may expect to hear that they need to pay their dues in their jobs
from baby boomers who believe they paid their dues in their time. Yet millennials may resist doing so because
they value life outside of work to a greater degree (Myers & Sadaghiani, 2010). Meister & Willyerd (2010) suggest
alternative approaches to training and mentoring that will engage millennials and adapt to their need for
feedback from supervisors: reverse mentoring, in which a younger employee educates a senior employee in
social media or other digital resources. The senior employee then has the opportunity to provide useful guidance
within a less demanding role.
Recruiting and retaining millennials and Generation X employees poses challenges that did not exist in previous
generations. The concept of building a career with the company is not relatable to most Generation X employees,
who do not expect to stay with one employer for their career. This expectation arises from of a reduced sense of
loyalty because they do not expect their employer to be loyal to them (Gibson, Greenwood, & Murphy, 2009).
Retaining Generation X workers thus relies on motivating them by making their work meaningful (Gibson,
Greenwood, & Murphy, 2009). Since millennials lack an inherent loyalty to the company, retaining them also
requires effort in the form of nurturing through frequent rewards, praise, and feedback.
Millennials are also interested in having many choices, including options in work scheduling, choice of job duties,
and so on. They also expect more training and education from their employers. Companies that offer the best
benefit package and brand attract millennials (Myers & Sadaghiani, 2010).
One well-recognized negative aspect of organizational culture is a culture of harassment, including sexual
harassment. Most organizations of any size have developed sexual harassment policies that define sexual
harassment (or harassment in general) and the procedures the organization has set in place to prevent and
address it when it does occur. Thus, in most jobs you have held, you were probably made aware of the
company’s sexual harassment policy and procedures, and may have received training related to the policy. The
U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (n.d.) provides the following description of sexual
harassment:
Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a
sexual nature constitute sexual harassment when this conduct explicitly or implicitly affects an
individual's employment, unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance, or creates
an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment. (par. 2)
DIG DEEPER
13.3 • Organizational Psychology: The Social Dimension of Work 475
One form of sexual harassment is called quid pro quo. Quid pro quo means you give something to get
something, and it refers to a situation in which organizational rewards are offered in exchange for sexual
favors. Quid pro quo harassment is often between an employee and a person with greater power in the
organization. For example, a supervisor might request an action, such as a kiss or a touch, in exchange for a
promotion, a positive performance review, or a pay raise. Another form of sexual harassment is the threat of
withholding a reward if a sexual request is refused. Hostile environment sexual harassment is another type of
workplace harassment. In this situation, an employee experiences conditions in the workplace that are
considered hostile or intimidating. For example, a work environment that allows offensive language or jokes or
displays sexually explicit images. Isolated occurrences of these events do not constitute harassment, but a
pattern of repeated occurrences does. In addition to violating organizational policies against sexual
harassment, these forms of harassment are illegal.
Harassment does not have to be sexual; it may be related to any of the protected classes in the statutes
regulated by the EEOC: race, national origin, religion, or age.
Violence in the Workplace
Workplace violence is any act or threat of physical violence, harassment, intimidation, or other threatening,
disruptive behavior that occurs at the workplace. It ranges from threats and verbal abuse to physical assaults
and even homicide (Occupational Safety & Health Administration, 2014).
There are different targets of workplace violence: a person could commit violence against coworkers,
supervisors, or property. Warning signs often precede such actions: intimidating behavior, threats, sabotaging
equipment, or radical changes in a coworker’s behavior. Often there is intimidation and then escalation that
leads to even further escalation. It is important for employees to involve their immediate supervisor if they
ever feel intimidated or unsafe.
Murder is the second leading cause of death in the workplace. It is also the primary cause of death for women
in the workplace. Every year there are nearly two million workers who are physically assaulted or threatened
with assault. Many are murdered in domestic violence situations by boyfriends or husbands who chose the
woman’s workplace to commit their crimes.
There are many triggers for workplace violence. A significant trigger is the feeling of being treated unfairly,
unjustly, or disrespectfully. In a research experiment, Greenberg (1993) examined the reactions of students
who were given pay for a task. In one group, the students were given extensive explanations for the pay rate. In
the second group, the students were given a curt uninformative explanation. The students were made to
believe the supervisor would not know how much money the student withdrew for payment. The rate of
stealing (taking more pay than they were told they deserved) was higher in the group who had been given the
limited explanation. This is a demonstration of the importance of procedural justice in organizations.
Procedural justice refers to the fairness of the processes by which outcomes are determined in conflicts with
or among employees.
In another study by Greenberg & Barling (1999), they found a history of aggression and amount of alcohol
consumed to be accurate predictors of workplace violence against a coworker. Aggression against a supervisor
was predicted if a worker felt unfairly treated or untrusted. Job security and alcohol consumption predicted
aggression against a subordinate. To understand and predict workplace violence, Greenberg & Barling (1999)
emphasize the importance of considering the employee target of aggression or violence and characteristics of
both the workplace characteristics and the aggressive or violent person.

1.4 Careers in Psychology
Clive Wearing is an accomplished musician who lost his ability to form new memories when
he became sick at the age of 46. While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember
what he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is
associated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend’s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John
Nash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would
tell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended
for him. He also began to hear voices and became suspicious of the people around him. Soon thereafter, Nash
was diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a state-run mental institution (O’Connor & Robertson,
1Introduction to Psychology
2002). Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these
experiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain’s internal
processes and people’s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of
psychology has explored these questions.
1.1 What Is Psychology?
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Define psychology
• Understand the merits of an education in psychology
What is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology
explores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists
use the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question
about how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the
phenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or
group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over
time. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes
observations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then
published or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.
Scientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because
it is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We
must ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However,
we can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus,
psychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.
In general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot
arrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the
mind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific
method is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on
observation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or
previous authorities.
It was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this
time, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is,
at its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological
organism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore,
psychology is also a social science.
WHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?
Often, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to
learn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course
because it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as
nursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare
psychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses
across the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology
majors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook’s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality
and political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About
6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S.
Department of Education, 2016).

An education in psychology is valuable for a number of reasons. Psychology students hone critical thinking
skills and are trained in the use of the scientific method. Critical thinking is the active application of a set of
skills to information for the understanding and evaluation of that information. The evaluation of
information—assessing its reliability and usefulness— is an important skill in a world full of competing “facts,”
many of which are designed to be misleading. For example, critical thinking involves maintaining an attitude
of skepticism, recognizing internal biases, making use of logical thinking, asking appropriate questions, and
making observations. Psychology students also can develop better communication skills during the course of
their undergraduate coursework (American Psychological Association, 2011). Together, these factors increase
students’ scientific literacy and prepare students to critically evaluate the various sources of information they
encounter.
In addition to these broad-based skills, psychology students come to understand the complex factors that
shape one’s behavior. They appreciate the interaction of our biology, our environment, and our experiences in
determining who we are and how we will behave. They learn about basic principles that guide how we think
and behave, and they come to recognize the tremendous diversity that exists across individuals and across
cultural boundaries (American Psychological Association, 2011).

1.2 History of Psychology
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Understand the importance of Wundt and James in the development of psychology
• Appreciate Freud’s influence on psychology
• Understand the basic tenets of Gestalt psychology
• Appreciate the important role that behaviorism played in psychology’s history
• Understand basic tenets of humanism
• Understand how the cognitive revolution shifted psychology’s focus back to the mind
Psychology is a relatively young science with its experimental roots in the 19th century, compared, for
example, to human physiology, which dates much earlier. As mentioned, anyone interested in exploring issues
related to the mind generally did so in a philosophical context prior to the 19th century. Two 19th century
scholars, Wilhelm Wundt and William James, are generally credited as being the founders of psychology as a
science and academic discipline that was distinct from philosophy. This section will provide an overview of the
shifts in paradigms that have influenced psychology from Wundt and James through today.
Wundt and Structuralism
Wilhelm Wundt (1832–1920) was a German scientist who was the first person to be referred to as a
psychologist. His famous book entitled Principles of Physiological Psychology was published in 1873. Wundt
viewed psychology as a scientific study of conscious experience, and he believed that the goal of psychology
was to identify components of consciousness and how those components combined to result in our conscious
experience. Wundt used introspection (he called it “internal perception”), a process by which someone
examines their own conscious experience as objectively as possible, making the human mind like any other
aspect of nature that a scientist observed. He believed in the notion of voluntarism—that people have free will
and should know the intentions of a psychological experiment if they were participating (Danziger, 1980).
Wundt considered his version experimental introspection; he used instruments such as those that measured
reaction time. He also wrote Volkerpsychologie in 1904 in which he suggested that psychology should include
the study of culture, as it involves the study of people. Edward Titchener, one of his students, went on to
1.2 • History of Psychology 9
develop structuralism. Its focus was on the contents of mental processes rather than their function (Pickren &
Rutherford, 2010). Wundt established his psychology laboratory at the University at Leipzig in 1879 (Figure
1.2). In this laboratory, Wundt and his students conducted experiments on, for example, reaction times. A
subject, sometimes in a room isolated from the scientist, would receive a stimulus such as a light, image, or
sound. The subject’s reaction to the stimulus would be to push a button, and an apparatus would record the
time to reaction. Wundt could measure reaction time to one-thousandth of a second (Nicolas & Ferrand, 1999).
FIGURE 1.2 (a) Wilhelm Wundt is credited as one of the founders of psychology. He created the first laboratory for
psychological research. (b) This photo shows him seated and surrounded by fellow researchers and equipment in
his laboratory in Germany.
However, despite his efforts to train individuals in the process of introspection, this process remained highly
subjective, and there was very little agreement between individuals.
Functionalism
William James, John Dewey, and Charles Sanders Peirce helped establish functional psychology (Figure 1.3).
They accepted Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection and viewed this theory as an explanation of an
organism’s characteristics. Key to that theory is the idea that natural selection leads to organisms that are
adapted to their environment, including their behavior. Adaptation means that a trait of an organism has a
function for the survival and reproduction of the individual, because it has been naturally selected. As James
saw it, psychology’s purpose was to study the function of behavior in the world, and as such, his perspective
was known as functionalism. Functionalism focused on how mental activities helped an organism fit into its
environment. Functionalism has a second, more subtle meaning in that functionalists were more interested in
the operation of the whole mind rather than of its individual parts, which were the focus of structuralism. Like
Wundt, James believed that introspection could serve as one means by which someone might study mental
activities, but James also relied on more objective measures, including the use of various recording devices,
and examinations of concrete products of mental activities and of anatomy and physiology (Gordon, 1995).

FIGURE 1.3 William James, shown here in a self-portrait, was the first American psychologist.
Freud and Psychoanalytic Theory
Perhaps one of the most influential and well-known figures in psychology’s history was Sigmund Freud (Figure
1.4). Freud (1856–1939) was an Austrian neurologist who was fascinated by patients suffering from “hysteria”
and neurosis. Hysteria was an ancient diagnosis for disorders, primarily of women with a wide variety of
symptoms, including physical symptoms and emotional disturbances, none of which had an apparent physical
cause. Freud theorized that many of his patients’ problems arose from the unconscious mind. In Freud’s view,
the unconscious mind was a repository of feelings and urges of which we have no awareness. Gaining access to
the unconscious, then, was crucial to the successful resolution of the patient’s problems. According to Freud,
the unconscious mind could be accessed through dream analysis, by examinations of the first words that came
to people’s minds, and through seemingly innocent slips of the tongue. Psychoanalytic theory focuses on the
role of a person’s unconscious, as well as early childhood experiences, and this particular perspective
dominated clinical psychology for several decades (Thorne & Henley, 2005).
FIGURE 1.4 (a) Sigmund Freud was a highly influential figure in the history of psychology. (b) One of his many
books, A General Introduction to Psychoanalysis, shared his ideas about psychoanalytical therapy; it was published
in 1922.
Freud’s ideas were influential, and you will learn more about them when you study lifespan development,
personality, and therapy. For instance, many therapists believe strongly in the unconscious and the impact of

INTRODUCTION
CHAPTER OUTLINE
2.1 Why Is Research Important?
2.2 Approaches to Research
2.3 Analyzing Findings
2.4 Ethics
Have you ever wondered whether the violence you see on television affects your behavior?
Are you more likely to behave aggressively in real life after watching people behave violently in dramatic
situations on the screen? Or, could seeing fictional violence actually get aggression out of your system, causing
you to be more peaceful? How are children influenced by the media they are exposed to? A psychologist
interested in the relationship between behavior and exposure to violent images might ask these very
questions.
Since ancient times, humans have been concerned about the effects of new technologies on our behaviors and
thinking processes. The Greek philosopher Socrates, for example, worried that writing—a new technology at
that time—would diminish people’s ability to remember because they could rely on written records rather than
committing information to memory. In our world of rapidly changing technologies, questions about their
effects on our daily lives and their resulting long-term impacts continue to emerge. In addition to the impact of
screen time (on smartphones, tablets, computers, and gaming), technology is emerging in our vehicles (such
as GPS and smart cars) and residences (with devices like Alexa or Google Home and doorbell cameras). As
these technologies become integrated into our lives, we are faced with questions about their positive and
negative impacts. Many of us find ourselves with a strong opinion on these issues, only to find the person next
to us bristling with the opposite view.
2Psychological Research
How can we go about finding answers that are supported not by mere opinion, but by evidence that we can all
agree on? The findings of psychological research can help us navigate issues like this.
2.1 Why Is Research Important?
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Explain how scientific research addresses questions about behavior
• Discuss how scientific research guides public policy
• Appreciate how scientific research can be important in making personal decisions
Scientific research is a critical tool for successfully navigating our complex world. Without it, we would be
forced to rely solely on intuition, other people’s authority, and blind luck. While many of us feel confident in
our abilities to decipher and interact with the world around us, history is filled with examples of how very
wrong we can be when we fail to recognize the need for evidence in supporting claims. At various times in
history, we would have been certain that the sun revolved around a flat earth, that the earth’s continents did
not move, and that mental illness was caused by possession (Figure 2.2). It is through systematic scientific
research that we divest ourselves of our preconceived notions and superstitions and gain an objective
understanding of ourselves and our world.
FIGURE 2.2 Some of our ancestors, across the world and over the centuries, believed that trephination—the
practice of making a hole in the skull, as shown here—allowed evil spirits to leave the body, thus curing mental
illness and other disorders. (credit: “taiproject”/Flickr)
The goal of all scientists is to better understand the world around them. Psychologists focus their attention on
understanding behavior, as well as the cognitive (mental) and physiological (body) processes that underlie
behavior. In contrast to other methods that people use to understand the behavior of others, such as intuition
and personal experience, the hallmark of scientific research is that there is evidence to support a claim.
Scientific knowledge is empirical: It is grounded in objective, tangible evidence that can be observed time and
time again, regardless of who is observing.
While behavior is observable, the mind is not. If someone is crying, we can see behavior. However, the reason
for the behavior is more difficult to determine. Is the person crying due to being sad, in pain, or happy?
Sometimes we can learn the reason for someone’s behavior by simply asking a question, like “Why are you
crying?” However, there are situations in which an individual is either uncomfortable or unwilling to answer
the question honestly, or is incapable of answering. For example, infants would not be able to explain why they
are crying. In such circumstances, the psychologist must be creative in finding ways to better understand
behavior. This chapter explores how scientific knowledge is generated, and how important that knowledge is in
forming decisions in our personal lives and in the public domain.
