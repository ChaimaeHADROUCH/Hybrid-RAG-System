    "# 🚀 Hybrid RAG System for CASML Generative AI Hackathon 🚀\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This repository presents my solution for the **CASML Generative AI Hackathon**. The goal was to build a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system to answer questions from a psychology textbook while providing verifiable references to sections and pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution Highlights\n",
    "1. **Hybrid Retriever**:\n",
    "  - Combines **Dense Retrieval** (FAISS + Sentence Embeddings) and **Sparse Retrieval** (BM25).\n",
    "   - **Re-Ranking**: Uses a **Cross-Encoder** to improve relevance of retrieved contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Generative Model**:\n",
    "   - Generates concise, context-aware answers using **Qwen2.5-0.5B**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Reference Extraction**:\n",
    "   - Provides supporting sections and page numbers for each generated answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hybrid Retrieval\n",
    "- **Dense Retrieval**: Efficient similarity search with **FAISS** and SentenceTransformer embeddings.\n",
    "- **Sparse Retrieval**: Keyword-based search using **BM25**.\n",
    "- **Hybrid Scoring**: Weighted combination of dense and sparse scores:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   hybrid_score = (self.dense_weight * dense_score) + ((1 - self.dense_weight) * sparse_score)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "- **Re-Ranking**: Top candidates are refined using a Cross-Encoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RAG Pipeline\n",
    "1. **Context Retrieval**: Fetches relevant sections using the hybrid retriever.\n",
    "2. **Answer Generation**: Generates answers using Qwen2.5-0.5B with retrieved context.\n",
    "3. **Reference Extraction**: Outputs relevant page and section references.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fine-Tuning (Optional)\n",
    "- **Sentence Embeddings** can be fine-tuned for domain-specific data using **MultipleNegativesRankingLoss** from SentenceTransformers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow\n",
    "1. Load and preprocess the textbook data.\n",
    "2. Perform **Hybrid Retrieval** with the `HybridRetriever` class.\n",
    "3. Generate answers with context using a generative model.\n",
    "4. Output a CSV file (`submission.csv`) in the required format:\n",
    "   - **ID**: Query ID\n",
    "   - **Context**: Retrieved sections\n",
    "   - **Answer**: Model-generated answer\n",
    "   - **References**: JSON with section and page details\n",
    "\n",
    "## References\n",
    "- **Textbook**: OpenStax Psychology (2e), CC BY 4.0.\n",
    "- **Models**:\n",
    "   - Sentence Embeddings: `all-mpnet-base-v2`\n",
    "   - Cross-Encoder: `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2`\n",
    "   - Generative Model: `Qwen2.5-0.5B`.\n"

While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember\\nwhat he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is\\nassociated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend’s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John\\nNash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would\\ntell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended\\nfor him. He also began to hear voices and became suspicious of the people around him. Soon thereafter, Nash\\nwas diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a state-run mental institution (O’Connor & Robertson,\\n1Introduction to Psychology\\n2002). Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these\\nexperiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain’s internal\\nprocesses and people’s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of\\npsychology has explored these questions.\\n1.1 What Is Psychology?\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Define psychology\\n• Understand the merits of an education in psychology\\nWhat is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology\\nexplores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists\\nuse the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question\\nabout how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the\\nphenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or\\ngroup of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over\\ntime. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes\\nobservations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then\\npublished or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.\\nScientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because\\nit is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We\\nmust ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However,\\nwe can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus,\\npsychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.\\nIn general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot\\narrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the\\nmind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific\\nmethod is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on\\nobservation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or\\nprevious authorities.\\nIt was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this\\ntime, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is,\\nat its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological\\norganism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore,\\npsychology is also a social science.\\nWHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?\\nOften, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to\\nlearn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course\\nbecause it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as\\nnursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare\\npsychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses\\nacross the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology\\nmajors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook’s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality\\nand political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About\\n6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S.\\nDepartment of Education, 2016).\\n8 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nAn education in psychology is valuable for a number of reasons. Psychology students hone critical thinking\\nskills and are trained in the use of the scientific method. Critical thinking is the active application of a set of\\nskills to information for the understanding and evaluation of that information. The evaluation of\\ninformation—assessing its reliability and usefulness— is an important skill in a world full of competing “facts,”\\nmany of which are designed to be misleading. For example, critical thinking involves maintaining an attitude\\nof skepticism, recognizing internal biases, making use of logical thinking, asking appropriate questions, and\\nmaking observations. Psychology students also can develop better communication skills during the course of\\ntheir undergraduate coursework (American Psychological Association, 2011). Together, these factors increase\\nstudents’ scientific literacy and prepare students to critically evaluate the various sources of information they\\nencounter.\\nIn addition to these broad-based skills, psychology students come to understand the complex factors that\\nshape one’s behavior. They appreciate the interaction of our biology, our environment, and our experiences in\\ndetermining who we are and how we will behave. They learn about basic principles that guide how we think\\nand behave, and they come to recognize the tremendous diversity that exists across individuals and across\\ncultural boundaries (American Psychological Association, 2011).\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nWatch a brief video about some questions to consider before deciding to major in psychology\\n(http://openstax.org/l/psycmajor) to learn more.\\n1.2 History of Psychology\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Understand the importance of Wundt and James in the development of psychology\\n• Appreciate Freud’s influence on psychology\\n• Understand the basic tenets of Gestalt psychology\\n• Appreciate the important role that behaviorism played in psychology’s history\\n• Understand basic tenets of humanism\\n• Understand how the cognitive revolution shifted psychology’s focus back to the mind\\nPsychology is a relatively young science with its experimental roots in the 19th century, compared, for\\nexample, to human physiology, which dates much earlier. As mentioned, anyone interested in exploring issues\\nrelated to the mind generally did so in a philosophical context prior to the 19th century. Two 19th century\\nscholars, Wilhelm Wundt and William James, are generally credited as being the founders of psychology as a\\nscience and academic discipline that was distinct from philosophy. This section will provide an overview of the\\nshifts in paradigms that have influenced psychology from Wundt and James through today.\\nWundt and Structuralism\\nWilhelm Wundt (1832–1920) was a German scientist who was the first person to be referred to as a\\npsychologist. His famous book entitled Principles of Physiological Psychology was published in 1873. Wundt\\nviewed psychology as a scientific study of conscious experience, and he believed that the goal of psychology\\nwas to identify components of consciousness and how those components combined to result in our conscious\\nexperience. Wundt used introspection (he called it “internal perception”), a process by which someone\\nexamines their own conscious experience as objectively as possible, making the human mind like any other\\naspect of nature that a scientist observed. He believed in the notion of voluntarism—that people have free will\\nand should know the intentions of a psychological experiment if they were participating (Danziger, 1980).\\nWundt considered his version experimental introspection; he used instruments such as those that measured\\nreaction time. He also wrote Volkerpsychologie in 1904 in which he suggested that psychology should include\\nthe study of culture, as it involves the study of people. Edward Titchener, one of his students, went on to\\n1.2 • History of Psychology 9\\ndevelop structuralism. Its focus was on the contents of mental processes rather than their function (Pickren &\\nRutherford, 2010). Wundt established his psychology laboratory at the University at Leipzig in 1879 (Figure\\n1.2). In this laboratory, Wundt and his students conducted experiments on, for example, reaction times. A\\nsubject, sometimes in a room isolated from the scientist, would receive a stimulus such as a light, image, or\\nsound. The subject’s reaction to the stimulus would be to push a button, and an apparatus would record the\\ntime to reaction. Wundt could measure reaction time to one-thousandth of a second (Nicolas & Ferrand, 1999).\\nFIGURE 1.2 (a) Wilhelm Wundt is credited as one of the founders of psychology. He created the first laboratory for\\npsychological research. (b) This photo shows him seated and surrounded by fellow researchers and equipment in\\nhis laboratory in Germany.\\nHowever, despite his efforts to train individuals in the process of introspection, this process remained highly\\nsubjective, and there was very little agreement between individuals.\\nFunctionalism\\nWilliam James, John Dewey, and Charles Sanders Peirce helped establish functional psychology (Figure 1.3).\\nThey accepted Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection and viewed this theory as an explanation of an\\norganism’s characteristics. Key to that theory is the idea that natural selection leads to organisms that are\\nadapted to their environment, including their behavior. Adaptation means that a trait of an organism has a\\nfunction for the survival and reproduction of the individual, because it has been naturally selected. As James\\nsaw it, psychology’s purpose was to study the function of behavior in the world, and as such, his perspective\\nwas known as functionalism. Functionalism focused on how mental activities helped an organism fit into its\\nenvironment. Functionalism has a second, more subtle meaning in that functionalists were more interested in\\nthe operation of the whole mind rather than of its individual parts, which were the focus of structuralism. Like\\nWundt, James believed that introspection could serve as one means by which someone might study mental\\nactivities, but James also relied on more objective measures, including the use of various recording devices,\\nand examinations of concrete products of mental activities and of anatomy and physiology (Gordon, 1995).\\n10 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\n4-year institutions and use these opportunities to gain experience in teaching. Furthermore, many 2-year\\ncolleges and schools need faculty to teach their courses in psychology. In general, many of the people who\\npursue careers at these institutions have master’s degrees in psychology, although some PhDs make careers at\\nthese institutions as well.\\nSome people earning PhDs may enjoy research in an academic setting. However, they may not be interested in\\nteaching. These individuals might take on faculty positions that are exclusively devoted to conducting\\nresearch. This type of position would be more likely an option at large, research-focused universities.\\nIn some areas in psychology, it is common for individuals who have recently earned their PhD to seek out\\npositions in postdoctoral training programs that are available before going on to serve as faculty. In most\\ncases, young scientists will complete one or two postdoctoral programs before applying for a full-time faculty\\nposition. Postdoctoral training programs allow young scientists to further develop their research programs\\nand broaden their research skills under the supervision of other professionals in the field.\\nCareer Options Outside of Academic Settings\\nIndividuals who wish to become practicing clinical psychologists have another option for earning a doctoral\\ndegree, which is known as a PsyD. A PsyD is a doctor of psychology degree that is increasingly popular among\\nindividuals interested in pursuing careers in clinical psychology. PsyD programs generally place less emphasis\\non research-oriented skills and focus more on application of psychological principles in the clinical context\\n(Norcross & Castle, 2002).\\nRegardless of whether earning a PhD or PsyD, in most states, an individual wishing to practice as a licensed\\nclinical or counseling psychologist may complete postdoctoral work under the supervision of a licensed\\npsychologist. Within the last few years, however, several states have begun to remove this requirement, which\\nwould allow people to get an earlier start in their careers (Munsey, 2009). After an individual has met the state\\nrequirements, their credentials are evaluated to determine whether they can sit for the licensure exam. Only\\nindividuals that pass this exam can call themselves licensed clinical or counseling psychologists (Norcross,\\nn.d.). Licensed clinical or counseling psychologists can then work in a number of settings, ranging from private\\nclinical practice to hospital settings. It should be noted that clinical psychologists and psychiatrists do different\\nthings and receive different types of education. While both can conduct therapy and counseling, clinical\\npsychologists have a PhD or a PsyD, whereas psychiatrists have a doctor of medicine degree (MD). As such,\\nlicensed clinical psychologists can administer and interpret psychological tests, while psychiatrists can\\nprescribe medications.\\nIndividuals earning a PhD can work in a variety of settings, depending on their areas of specialization. For\\nexample, someone trained as a biopsychologist might work in a pharmaceutical company to help test the\\nefficacy of a new drug. Someone with a clinical background might become a forensic psychologist and work\\nwithin the legal system to make recommendations during criminal trials and parole hearings, or serve as an\\nexpert in a court case.\\nWhile earning a doctoral degree in psychology is a lengthy process, usually taking between 5–6 years of\\ngraduate study (DeAngelis, 2010), there are a number of careers that can be attained with a master’s degree in\\npsychology. People who wish to provide psychotherapy can become licensed to serve as various types of\\nprofessional counselors (Hoffman, 2012). Relevant master’s degrees are also sufficient for individuals seeking\\ncareers as school psychologists (National Association of School Psychologists, n.d.), in some capacities related\\nto sport psychology (American Psychological Association, 2014), or as consultants in various industrial\\nsettings (Landers, 2011, June 14). Undergraduate coursework in psychology may be applicable to other careers\\nsuch as psychiatric social work or psychiatric nursing, where assessments and therapy may be a part of the\\njob.\\nAs mentioned in the opening section of this chapter, an undergraduate education in psychology is associated\\nwith a knowledge base and skill set that many employers find quite attractive. It should come as no surprise,\\n28 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nthen, that individuals earning bachelor’s degrees in psychology find themselves in a number of different\\ncareers, as shown in Table 1.1. Examples of a few such careers can involve serving as case managers, working\\nin sales, working in human resource departments, and teaching in high schools. The rapidly growing realm of\\nhealthcare professions is another field in which an education in psychology is helpful and sometimes required.\\nFor example, the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) exam that people must take to be admitted to medical\\nschool now includes a section on the psychological foundations of behavior.\\nTop Occupations Employing Graduates with a BA in Psychology (Fogg, Harrington, Harrington, & Shatkin,\\n2012)\\nRanking Occupation\\n1 Mid- and top-level management (executive, administrator)\\n2 Sales\\n3 Social work\\n4 Other management positions\\n5 Human resources (personnel, training)\\n6 Other administrative positions\\n7 Insurance, real estate, business\\n8 Marketing and sales\\n9 Healthcare (nurse, pharmacist, therapist)\\n10 Finance (accountant, auditor)\\nTABLE 1.1\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nThe APA provides career information (http://openstax.org/l/careers) about various areas of psychology.\\n1.4 • Careers in Psychology 29\\nKey Terms\\nAmerican Psychological Association (APA) professional organization representing psychologists in the\\nUnited States\\nbehaviorism focus on observing and controlling behavior\\nbiopsychology study of how biology influences behavior\\nbiopsychosocial model perspective that asserts that biology, psychology, and social factors interact to\\ndetermine an individual’s health\\nclinical psychology area of psychology that focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of psychological disorders\\nand other problematic patterns of behavior\\ncognitive psychology study of cognitions, or thoughts, and their relationship to experiences and actions\\ncounseling psychology area of psychology that focuses on improving emotional, social, vocational, and other\\naspects of the lives of psychologically healthy individuals\\ndevelopmental psychology scientific study of development across a lifespan\\ndissertation long research paper about research that was conducted as a part of the candidate’s doctoral\\ntraining\\nempirical method method for acquiring knowledge based on observation, including experimentation, rather\\nthan a method based only on forms of logical argument or previous authorities\\nforensic psychology area of psychology that applies the science and practice of psychology to issues within\\nand related to the justice system\\nfunctionalism focused on how mental activities helped an organism adapt to its environment\\nhumanism perspective within psychology that emphasizes the potential for good that is innate to all humans\\nintrospection process by which someone examines their own conscious experience in an attempt to break it\\ninto its component parts\\nology suffix that denotes “scientific study of”\\npersonality psychology study of patterns of thoughts and behaviors that make each individual unique\\npersonality trait consistent pattern of thought and behavior\\nPhD (doctor of philosophy) doctoral degree conferred in many disciplinary perspectives housed in a\\ntraditional college of liberal arts and sciences\\npostdoctoral training program allows young scientists to further develop their research programs and\\nbroaden their research skills under the supervision of other professionals in the field\\npsychoanalytic theory focus on the role of the unconscious in affecting conscious behavior\\npsychology scientific study of the mind and behavior\\nPsyD (doctor of psychology) doctoral degree that places less emphasis on research-oriented skills and focuses\\nmore on application of psychological principles in the clinical context\\nsport and exercise psychology area of psychology that focuses on the interactions between mental and\\nemotional factors and physical performance in sports, exercise, and other activities\\nstructuralism understanding the conscious experience through introspection\\nSummary\\n1.1 What Is Psychology?\\nPsychology is defined as the scientific study of mind and behavior. Students of psychology develop critical\\nthinking skills, become familiar with the scientific method, and recognize the complexity of behavior.\\n1.2 History of Psychology\\nBefore the time of Wundt and James, questions about the mind were considered by philosophers. However,\\nboth Wundt and James helped create psychology as a distinct scientific discipline. Wundt was a structuralist,\\nwhich meant he believed that our cognitive experience was best understood by breaking that experience into\\nits component parts. He thought this was best accomplished by introspection.\\n30 1 • Key Terms\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nWilliam James was the first American psychologist, and he was a proponent of functionalism. This particular\\nperspective focused on how mental activities served as adaptive responses to an organism’s environment. Like\\nWundt, James also relied on introspection; however, his research approach also incorporated more objective\\nmeasures as well.\\nSigmund Freud believed that understanding the unconscious mind was absolutely critical to understand\\nconscious behavior. This was especially true for individuals that he saw who suffered from various hysterias\\nand neuroses. Freud relied on dream analysis, slips of the tongue, and free association as means to access the\\nunconscious. Psychoanalytic theory remained a dominant force in clinical psychology for several decades.\\nGestalt psychology was very influential in Europe. Gestalt psychology takes a holistic view of an individual and\\nhis experiences. As the Nazis came to power in Germany, Wertheimer, Koffka, and Köhler immigrated to the\\nUnited States. Although they left their laboratories and their research behind, they did introduce America to\\nGestalt ideas. Some of the principles of Gestalt psychology are still very influential in the study of sensation\\nand perception.\\nOne of the most influential schools of thought within psychology’s history was behaviorism. Behaviorism\\nfocused on making psychology an objective science by studying overt behavior and deemphasizing the\\nimportance of unobservable mental processes. John Watson is often considered the father of behaviorism, and\\nB. F. Skinner’s contributions to our understanding of principles of operant conditioning cannot be\\nunderestimated.\\nAs behaviorism and psychoanalytic theory took hold of so many aspects of psychology, some began to become\\ndissatisfied with psychology’s picture of human nature. Thus, a humanistic movement within psychology\\nbegan to take hold. Humanism focuses on the potential of all people for good. Both Maslow and Rogers were\\ninfluential in shaping humanistic psychology.\\nDuring the 1950s, the landscape of psychology began to change. A science of behavior began to shift back to its\\nroots of focus on mental processes. The emergence of neuroscience and computer science aided this\\ntransition. Ultimately, the cognitive revolution took hold, and people came to realize that cognition was crucial\\nto a true appreciation and understanding of behavior.\\n1.3 Contemporary Psychology\\nPsychology is a diverse discipline that is made up of several major subdivisions with unique perspectives.\\nBiological psychology involves the study of the biological bases of behavior. Sensation and perception refer to\\nthe area of psychology that is focused on how information from our sensory modalities is received, and how\\nthis information is transformed into our perceptual experiences of the world around us. Cognitive psychology\\nis concerned with the relationship that exists between thought and behavior, and developmental psychologists\\nstudy the physical and cognitive changes that occur throughout one’s lifespan. Personality psychology focuses\\non individuals’ unique patterns of behavior, thought, and emotion. Industrial and organizational psychology,\\nhealth psychology, sport and exercise psychology, forensic psychology, and clinical psychology are all\\nconsidered applied areas of psychology. Industrial and organizational psychologists apply psychological\\nconcepts to I-O settings. Health psychologists look for ways to help people live healthier lives, and clinical\\npsychology involves the diagnosis and treatment of psychological disorders and other problematic behavioral\\npatterns. Sport and exercise psychologists study the interactions between thoughts, emotions, and physical\\nperformance in sports, exercise, and other activities. Forensic psychologists carry out activities related to\\npsychology in association with the justice system.\\n1.4 Careers in Psychology\\nGenerally, academic careers in psychology require doctoral degrees. However, there are a number of\\nnonacademic career options for people who have master’s degrees in psychology. While people with bachelor’s\\ndegrees in psychology have more limited psychology-related career options, the skills acquired as a function of\\n1 • Summary 31\\nan undergraduate education in psychology are useful in a variety of work contexts.\\nReview Questions\\n1.

While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember what he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is associated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend’s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John Nash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would tell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended for him. He also began to hear voices in his head that he could not control. When he tried to stop them, they would come back to him, and when he did not want them to, the voices would leave him (Wearing, n.d.). These are just a few of the many examples of how people experience the world around them in ways that are unpredictable and difficult to understand. In this chapter, we will explore what psychology is, what it is not, and how it has evolved over time. We will also look at some common misconceptions about psychology. Finally, we will discuss some careers in psychology and the role that psychology plays in our lives. 2. WHAT IS PSYCHOLOGY? The word “psychology” comes from two Greek words, “psyche” and “logos,” which mean “mind” or “thinking.” Psychologists are interested in how the mind works and how we think and feel. They study the mental processes that occur in the brain, such as perception, attention, memory, thinking, problem solving, emotion, motivation, learning, decision making, self-regulation, personality, social behavior, etc. Psychologists use a variety of methods to study these processes, including observation, experiments, surveys, interviews, questionnaires, brain imaging, neuropsychology, cognitive neuroscience, psychometrics, clinical psychology, developmental psychology, ethnopsychology and social psychology. Psychology has a long and rich history. It has been practiced for thousands of years in many different cultures and societies. For example, in ancient Greece, Plato and Aristotle studied psychology in order to understand the nature of human beings and their relationships with each other and with their environment. In the Middle Ages, Christian theologians and philosophers used psychology as a tool for understanding the nature of God and his relationship with his creatures. During the Renaissance, scientists and thinkers such as Galileo Galilei, Isaac Newton, René Descartes, John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Auguste Comte, Jean-Paul Sartre, Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, William James, Edward Thorndike, B.F. Skinner and others developed theories of psychology that continue to shape our understanding of this field today. Today, psychology is a broad and diverse field that encompasses a wide range of subfields and disciplines. Some of these disciplines include: • Clinical psychology: This field focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders, as well as', 'references': '{\"sections\": [\"Introduction to Psychology/Contemporary Psychology\", \"Psychological Research/Approaches to Research\"], \"pages\": [\"20\", \"42\", \"44\"]}'}\n",
      "Response for query ID 2: {'context': 'FIGURE 3.6 In this Punnett square, N represents the normal allele, and p represents the recessive allele that is\\nassociated with PKU. If two individuals mate who are both heterozygous for the allele associated with PKU, their\\noffspring have a 25% chance of expressing the PKU phenotype.\\nWhere do harmful genes that contribute to diseases like PKU come from? Gene mutations provide one source\\nof harmful genes. A mutation is a sudden, permanent change in a gene. While many mutations can be harmful\\nor lethal, once in a while, a mutation benefits an individual by giving that person an advantage over those who\\ndo not have the mutation. Recall that the theory of evolution asserts that individuals best adapted to their\\nparticular environments are more likely to reproduce and pass on their genes to future generations. In order\\nfor this process to occur, there must be competition—more technically, there must be variability in genes (and\\nresultant traits) that allow for variation in adaptability to the environment. If a population consisted of\\nidentical individuals, then any dramatic changes in the environment would affect everyone in the same way,\\nand there would be no variation in selection. In contrast, diversity in genes and associated traits allows some\\nindividuals to perform slightly better than others when faced with environmental change. This creates a\\ndistinct advantage for individuals best suited for their environments in terms of successful reproduction and\\ngenetic transmission.\\nHuman Diversity\\nThis chapter focuses on biology. Later in this course you will learn about social psychology and issues of race,\\nprejudice, and discrimination. When we focus strictly on biology, race becomes a weak construct. After the\\nsequencing of the human genome at the turn of the millennium, many scientists began to argue that race was not\\na useful variable in genetic research and that its continued use represents a potential source of confusion and\\nharm. The racial categories that some believed to be helpful in studying genetic diversity in humans are largely\\nirrelevant. A person\\'s skin tone, eye color, and hair texture are functions of their genetic makeups, but there is\\nactually more genetic variation within a given racial category than there is between racial categories. In some\\ncases, focus on race has led to difficulties with misdiagnoses and/or under-diagnoses of diseases ranging from\\nsickle cell anemia to cystic fibrosis. Some argue that we need to distinguish between ancestry and race and then\\nfocus on ancestry. This approach would facilitate greater understanding of human genetic diversity (Yudell,\\nRoberts, DeSalle, & Tishkoff, 2016).\\nDIG DEEPER\\n76 3 • Biopsychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nGene-Environment Interactions\\nGenes do not exist in a vacuum. Although we are all biological organisms, we also exist in an environment that\\nis incredibly important in determining not only when and how our genes express themselves, but also in what\\ncombination. Each of us represents a unique interaction between our genetic makeup and our environment;\\nrange of reaction is one way to describe this interaction. Range of reaction asserts that our genes set the\\nboundaries within which we can operate, and our environment interacts with the genes to determine where in\\nthat range we will fall. For example, if an individual’s genetic makeup predisposes them to high levels of\\nintellectual potential and they are reared in a rich, stimulating environment, then they will be more likely to\\nachieve full potential than if they were raised under conditions of significant deprivation. According to the\\nconcept of range of reaction, genes set definite limits on potential, and environment determines how much of\\nthat potential is achieved. Some disagree with this theory and argue that genes do not set a limit on a person’s\\npotential with reaction norms being determined by the environment. For example, when individuals\\nexperience neglect or abuse early in life, they are more likely to exhibit adverse psychological and/or physical\\nconditions that can last throughout their lives. These conditions may develop as a function of the negative\\nenvironmental experiences in individuals from dissimilar genetic backgrounds (Miguel, Pereira, Silveira, &\\nMeaney, 2019; Short & Baram, 2019).\\nAnother perspective on the interaction between genes and the environment is the concept of genetic\\nenvironmental correlation. Stated simply, our genes influence our environment, and our environment\\ninfluences the expression of our genes (Figure 3.7). Not only do our genes and environment interact, as in\\nrange of reaction, but they also influence one another bidirectionally. For example, the child of an NBA player\\nwould probably be exposed to basketball from an early age. Such exposure might allow the child to realize\\ntheir full genetic, athletic potential. Thus, the parents’ genes, which the child shares, influence the child’s\\nenvironment, and that environment, in turn, is well suited to support the child’s genetic potential.\\nFIGURE 3.7 Nature and nurture work together like complex pieces of a human puzzle. The interaction of our\\nenvironment and genes makes us the individuals we are. (credit \"puzzle\": modification of work by Cory Zanker)\\nIn another approach to gene-environment interactions, the field of epigenetics looks beyond the genotype\\nitself and studies how the same genotype can be expressed in different ways. In other words, researchers study\\nhow the same genotype can lead to very different phenotypes. As mentioned earlier, gene expression is often\\ninfluenced by environmental context in ways that are not entirely obvious. For instance, identical twins share\\nthe same genetic information (identical twins develop from a single fertilized egg that split, so the genetic\\nmaterial is exactly the same in each; in contrast, fraternal twins usually result from two different eggs\\nfertilized by different sperm, so the genetic material varies as with non-twin siblings). But even with identical\\ngenes, there remains an incredible amount of variability in how gene expression can unfold over the course of\\neach twin’s life. Sometimes, one twin will develop a disease and the other will not. In one example, Aliya, an\\nidentical twin, died from cancer at age 7, but her twin, now 19 years old, has never had cancer. Although these\\nindividuals share an identical genotype, their phenotypes differ as a result of how that genetic information is\\n3.1 • Human Genetics 77\\nexpressed over time and through their unique environmental interactions. The epigenetic perspective is very\\ndifferent from range of reaction, because here the genotype is not fixed and limited.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nWatch this video about the epigenetics of twin studies (http://openstax.org/l/twinstudy) to learn more.\\nGenes affect more than our physical characteristics. Indeed, scientists have found genetic linkages to a\\nnumber of behavioral characteristics, ranging from basic personality traits to sexual orientation to spirituality\\n(for examples, see Mustanski et al., 2005; Comings, Gonzales, Saucier, Johnson, & MacMurray, 2000). Genes are\\nalso associated with temperament and a number of psychological disorders, such as depression and\\nschizophrenia. So while it is true that genes provide the biological blueprints for our cells, tissues, organs, and\\nbody, they also have a significant impact on our experiences and our behaviors.\\nLet’s look at the following findings regarding schizophrenia in light of our three views of gene-environment\\ninteractions. Which view do you think best explains this evidence?\\nIn a 2004 study by Tienari and colleagues, adoptees whose biological mothers had schizophrenia and who had\\nbeen raised in a disturbed family environment were much more likely to develop schizophrenia or another\\npsychotic disorder than were any of the other groups in the study:\\n• Of adoptees whose biological mothers had schizophrenia (high genetic risk) and who were raised in\\ndisturbed family environments, 36.8% were likely to develop schizophrenia.\\n• Of adoptees whose biological mothers had schizophrenia (high genetic risk) and who were raised in\\nhealthy family environments, 5.8% were likely to develop schizophrenia.\\n• Of adoptees with a low genetic risk (whose mothers did not have schizophrenia) and who were raised in\\ndisturbed family environments, 5.3% were likely to develop schizophrenia.\\n• Of adoptees with a low genetic risk (whose mothers did not have schizophrenia) and who were raised in\\nhealthy family environments, 4.8% were likely to develop schizophrenia.\\nThe study shows that adoptees with high genetic risk were most likely to develop schizophrenia if they were\\nraised in disturbed home environments. This research lends credibility to the notion that both genetic\\nvulnerability and environmental stress are necessary for schizophrenia to develop, and that genes alone do not\\ntell the full tale.\\n3.2 Cells of the Nervous System\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Identify the basic parts of a neuron\\n• Describe how neurons communicate with each other\\n• Explain how drugs act as agonists or antagonists for a given neurotransmitter system\\nPsychologists striving to understand the human mind may study the nervous system. Learning how the body\\'s\\ncells and organs function can help us understand the biological basis of human psychology. The nervous\\nsystem is composed of two basic cell types: glial cells (also known as glia) and neurons. Glial cells are\\ntraditionally thought to play a supportive role to neurons, both physically and metabolically. Glial cells provide\\nscaffolding on which the nervous system is built, help neurons line up closely with each other to allow\\nneuronal communication, provide insulation to neurons, transport nutrients and waste products, and mediate\\nimmune responses. For years, researchers believed that there were many more glial cells than neurons;\\nhowever, more recent work from Suzanna Herculano-Houzel\\'s laboratory has called this long-standing\\nassumption into question and has provided important evidence that there may be a nearly 1:1 ratio of glia cells\\nto neurons. This is important because it suggests that human brains are more similar to other primate brains\\nthan previously thought (Azevedo et al, 2009; Herculano-Houzel, 2012; Herculano-Houzel, 2009). Neurons, on\\n78 3 • Biopsychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nthe other hand, serve as interconnected information processors that are essential for all of the tasks of the\\nnervous system. This section briefly describes the structure and function of neurons.\\nNeuron Structure\\nNeurons are the central building blocks of the nervous system, 100 billion strong at birth. Like all cells,\\nneurons consist of several different parts, each serving a specialized function (Figure 3.8). A neuron’s outer\\nsurface is made up of a semipermeable membrane. This membrane allows smaller molecules and molecules\\nwithout an electrical charge to pass through it, while stopping larger or highly charged molecules.\\nFIGURE 3.8 This illustration shows a prototypical neuron, which is being myelinated by a glial cell.\\nThe nucleus of the neuron is located in the soma, or cell body. The soma has branching extensions known as\\ndendrites. The neuron is a small information processor, and dendrites serve as input sites where signals are\\nreceived from other neurons. These signals are transmitted electrically across the soma and down a major\\nextension from the soma known as the axon, which ends at multiple terminal buttons. The terminal buttons\\ncontain synaptic vesicles that house neurotransmitters, the chemical messengers of the nervous system.\\nAxons range in length from a fraction of an inch to several feet. In some axons, glial cells form a fatty substance\\nknown as the myelin sheath, which coats the axon and acts as an insulator, increasing the speed at which the\\nsignal travels. The myelin sheath is not continuous and there are small gaps that occur down the length of the\\naxon. These gaps in the myelin sheath are known as the Nodes of Ranvier. The myelin sheath is crucial for the\\nnormal operation of the neurons within the nervous system: the loss of the insulation it provides can be\\ndetrimental to normal function. To understand how this works, let’s consider an example. PKU, a genetic\\ndisorder discussed earlier, causes a reduction in myelin and abnormalities in white matter cortical and\\nsubcortical structures. The disorder is associated with a variety of issues including severe cognitive deficits,\\nexaggerated reflexes, and seizures (Anderson & Leuzzi, 2010; Huttenlocher, 2000). Another disorder, multiple\\nsclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disorder, involves a large-scale loss of the myelin sheath on axons throughout\\nthe nervous system. The resulting interference in the electrical signal prevents the quick transmittal of\\ninformation by neurons and can lead to a number of symptoms, such as dizziness, fatigue, loss of motor\\ncontrol, and sexual dysfunction. While some treatments may help to modify the course of the disease and\\nmanage certain symptoms, there is currently no known cure for multiple sclerosis.\\nIn healthy individuals, the neuronal signal moves rapidly down the axon to the terminal buttons, where\\nsynaptic vesicles release neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft (Figure 3.9). The synaptic cleft is a very\\nsmall space between two neurons and is an important site where communication between neurons occurs.\\nOnce neurotransmitters are released into the synaptic cleft, they travel across it and bind with corresponding\\nreceptors on the dendrite of an adjacent neuron. Receptors, proteins on the cell surface where\\nneurotransmitters attach, vary in shape, with different shapes “matching” different neurotransmitters.\\nHow does a neurotransmitter “know” which receptor to bind to? The neurotransmitter and the receptor have\\n3.2 • Cells of the Nervous System 79\\nwhat is referred to as a lock-and-key relationship—specific neurotransmitters fit specific receptors similar to\\nhow a key fits a lock. The neurotransmitter binds to any receptor that it fits.\\nFIGURE 3.9 (a) The synaptic cleft is the space between the terminal button of one neuron and the dendrite of\\nanother neuron.

The neuron exists in a fluid environment—it is surrounded by\\nextracellular fluid and contains intracellular fluid (i.e., cytoplasm). The neuronal membrane keeps these two\\nfluids separate—a critical role because the electrical signal that passes through the neuron depends on the\\nintra- and extracellular fluids being electrically different. This difference in charge across the membrane,\\ncalled the membrane potential, provides energy for the signal.\\nThe electrical charge of the fluids is caused by charged molecules (ions) dissolved in the fluid. The\\nsemipermeable nature of the neuronal membrane somewhat restricts the movement of these charged\\nmolecules, and, as a result, some of the charged particles tend to become more concentrated either inside or\\noutside the cell.\\nBetween signals, the neuron membrane’s potential is held in a state of readiness, called the resting potential.\\nLike a rubber band stretched out and waiting to spring into action, ions line up on either side of the cell\\nmembrane, ready to rush across the membrane when the neuron goes active and the membrane opens its\\ngates. Ions in high-concentration areas are ready to move to low-concentration areas, and positive ions are\\nready to move to areas with a negative charge.\\nIn the resting state, sodium (Na+) is at higher concentrations outside the cell, so it will tend to move into the\\ncell. Potassium (K+), on the other hand, is more concentrated inside the cell, and will tend to move out of the\\ncell (Figure 3.10). In addition, the inside of the cell is slightly negatively charged compared to the outside, due\\nto the activity of the sodium-potassium pump. This pump actively transports three sodium ions out of the cell\\nfor every two potassium ions in, creating a net negative charge inside the cell. This provides an additional\\nforce on sodium, causing it to move into the cell.\\n80 3 • Biopsychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nmotivation and behavior\\ngyrus (plural: gyri) bump or ridge on the cerebral cortex\\nhemisphere left or right half of the brain\\nheterozygous consisting of two different alleles\\nhindbrain division of the brain containing the medulla, pons, and cerebellum\\nhippocampus structure in the temporal lobe associated with learning and memory\\nhomeostasis state of equilibrium—biological conditions, such as body temperature, are maintained at optimal\\nlevels\\nhomozygous consisting of two identical alleles\\nhormone chemical messenger released by endocrine glands\\nhypothalamus forebrain structure that regulates sexual motivation and behavior and a number of\\nhomeostatic processes;

Different versions of a gene are called\\nalleles—sometimes alleles can be classified as dominant or recessive. A dominant allele always results in the\\ndominant phenotype. In order to exhibit a recessive phenotype, an individual must be homozygous for the\\nrecessive allele. Genes affect both physical and psychological characteristics. Ultimately, how and when a gene\\nis expressed, and what the outcome will be—in terms of both physical and psychological characteristics—is a\\nfunction of the interaction between our genes and our environments.\\n3.2 Cells of the Nervous System\\nGlia and neurons are the two cell types that make up the nervous system. While glia generally play supporting\\nroles, the communication between neurons is fundamental to all of the functions associated with the nervous\\nsystem. Neuronal communication is made possible by the neuron’s specialized structures. The soma contains\\nthe cell nucleus, and the dendrites extend from the soma in tree-like branches. The axon is another major\\nextension of the cell body; axons are often covered by a myelin sheath, which increases the speed of\\ntransmission of neural impulses. At the end of the axon are terminal buttons that contain synaptic vesicles\\nfilled with neurotransmitters.\\nNeuronal communication is an electrochemical event. The dendrites contain receptors for neurotransmitters\\nreleased by nearby neurons. If the signals received from other neurons are sufficiently strong, an action\\npotential will travel down the length of the axon to the terminal buttons, resulting in the release of\\nneurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. Action potentials operate on the all-or-none principle and involve\\n102 3 • Summary\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nthe movement of Na+ and K+ across the neuronal membrane.\\nDifferent neurotransmitters are associated with different functions. Often, psychological disorders involve\\nimbalances in a given neurotransmitter system. Therefore, psychotropic drugs are prescribed in an attempt to\\nbring the neurotransmitters back into balance. Drugs can act either as agonists or as antagonists for a given\\nneurotransmitter system.\\n3.3 Parts of the Nervous System\\nThe brain and spinal cord make up the central nervous system. The peripheral nervous system is comprised of\\nthe somatic and autonomic nervous systems. The somatic nervous system transmits sensory and motor\\nsignals to and from the central nervous system. The autonomic nervous system controls the function of our\\norgans and glands, and can be divided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions. Sympathetic\\nactivation prepares us for fight or flight, while parasympathetic activation is associated with normal\\nfunctioning under relaxed conditions.\\n3.4 The Brain and Spinal Cord\\nThe brain consists of two hemispheres, each controlling the opposite side of the body. Each hemisphere can be\\nsubdivided into different lobes: frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital. In addition to the lobes of the\\ncerebral cortex, the forebrain includes the thalamus (sensory relay) and limbic system (emotion and memory\\ncircuit). The midbrain contains the reticular formation, which is important for sleep and arousal, as well as the\\nsubstantia nigra and ventral tegmental area. These structures are important for movement, reward, and\\naddictive processes. The hindbrain contains the structures of the brainstem (medulla, pons, and midbrain),\\nwhich control automatic functions like breathing and blood pressure. The hindbrain also contains the\\ncerebellum, which helps coordinate movement and certain types of memories.\\nIndividuals with brain damage have been studied extensively to provide information about the role of different\\nareas of the brain, and recent advances in technology allow us to glean similar information by imaging brain\\nstructure and function. These techniques include CT, PET, MRI, fMRI, and EEG.\\n3.5 The Endocrine System\\nThe glands of the endocrine system secrete hormones to regulate normal body functions. The hypothalamus\\nserves as the interface between the nervous system and the endocrine system, and it controls the secretions of\\nthe pituitary. The pituitary serves as the master gland, controlling the secretions of all other glands. The\\nthyroid secretes thyroxine, which is important for basic metabolic processes and growth; the adrenal glands\\nsecrete hormones involved in the stress response; the pancreas secretes hormones that regulate blood sugar\\nlevels; and the ovaries and testes produce sex hormones that regulate sexual motivation and behavior.\\nReview Questions\\n1.

As hair cells become activated, they generate neural impulses that travel along the\\nauditory nerve to the brain. Auditory information is shuttled to the inferior colliculus, the medial geniculate\\nnucleus of the thalamus, and finally to the auditory cortex in the temporal lobe of the brain for processing. Like\\nthe visual system, there is also evidence suggesting that information about auditory recognition and\\nlocalization is processed in parallel streams (Rauschecker & Tian, 2000; Renier et al., 2009).\\nPitch Perception\\nDifferent frequencies of sound waves are associated with differences in our perception of the pitch of those\\nsounds. Low-frequency sounds are lower pitched, and high-frequency sounds are higher pitched. How does\\nthe auditory system differentiate among various pitches?\\nSeveral theories have been proposed to account for pitch perception. We’ll discuss two of them here: temporal\\ntheory and place theory. The temporal theory of pitch perception asserts that frequency is coded by the\\nactivity level of a sensory neuron. This would mean that a given hair cell would fire action potentials related to\\nthe frequency of the sound wave. While this is a very intuitive explanation, we detect such a broad range of\\nfrequencies (20–20,000 Hz) that the frequency of action potentials fired by hair cells cannot account for the\\nentire range. Because of properties related to sodium channels on the neuronal membrane that are involved in\\naction potentials, there is a point at which a cell cannot fire any faster (Shamma, 2001).\\nThe place theory of pitch perception suggests that different portions of the basilar membrane are sensitive to\\nsounds of different frequencies. More specifically, the base of the basilar membrane responds best to high\\nfrequencies and the tip of the basilar membrane responds best to low frequencies. Therefore, hair cells that\\nare in the base portion would be labeled as high-pitch receptors, while those in the tip of basilar membrane\\nwould be labeled as low-pitch receptors (Shamma, 2001).\\nIn reality, both theories explain different aspects of pitch perception. At frequencies up to about 4000 Hz, it is\\nclear that both the rate of action potentials and place contribute to our perception of pitch. However, much\\nhigher frequency sounds can only be encoded using place cues (Shamma, 2001).\\nSound Localization\\nThe ability to locate sound in our environments is an important part of hearing. Localizing sound could be\\nconsidered similar to the way that we perceive depth in our visual fields. Like the monocular and binocular\\ncues that provided information about depth, the auditory system uses both monaural (one-eared) and\\nbinaural (two-eared) cues to localize sound.\\nEach pinna interacts with incoming sound waves differently, depending on the sound’s source relative to our\\nbodies. This interaction provides a monaural cue that is helpful in locating sounds that occur above or below\\nand in front or behind us. The sound waves received by your two ears from sounds that come from directly\\nabove, below, in front, or behind you would be identical; therefore, monaural cues are essential (Grothe, Pecka,\\n& McAlpine, 2010).\\nBinaural cues, on the other hand, provide information on the location of a sound along a horizontal axis by\\nrelying on differences in patterns of vibration of the eardrum between our two ears. If a sound comes from an\\noff-center location, it creates two types of binaural cues: interaural level differences and interaural timing\\ndifferences. Interaural level difference refers to the fact that a sound coming from the right side of your body\\nis more intense at your right ear than at your left ear because of the attenuation of the sound wave as it passes\\nthrough your head. Interaural timing difference refers to the small difference in the time at which a given\\nsound wave arrives at each ear (Figure 5.19). Certain brain areas monitor these differences to construct where\\nalong a horizontal axis a sound originates (Grothe et al., 2010).\\n162 5 • Sensation and Perception\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nFIGURE 5.19 Localizing sound involves the use of both monaural and binaural cues. (credit \"plane\": modification of\\nwork by Max Pfandl)\\nHearing Loss\\nDeafness is the partial or complete inability to hear. Some people are born without hearing, which is known as\\ncongenital deafness. Other people suffer from conductive hearing loss, which is due to a problem delivering\\nsound energy to the cochlea. Causes for conductive hearing loss include blockage of the ear canal, a hole in the\\ntympanic membrane, problems with the ossicles, or fluid in the space between the eardrum and cochlea.\\nAnother group of people suffer from sensorineural hearing loss, which is the most common form of hearing\\nloss. Sensorineural hearing loss can be caused by many factors, such as aging, head or acoustic trauma,\\ninfections and diseases (such as measles or mumps), medications, environmental effects such as noise\\nexposure (noise-induced hearing loss, as shown in Figure 5.20), tumors, and toxins (such as those found in\\ncertain solvents and metals).\\nFIGURE 5.20 Environmental factors that can lead to sensorineural hearing loss include regular exposure to loud\\nmusic or construction equipment. (a) Musical performers and (b) construction workers are at risk for this type of\\nhearing loss. (credit a: modification of work by \"GillyBerlin_Flickr\"/Flickr; credit b: modification of work by Nick\\nAllen)\\nGiven the mechanical nature by which the sound wave stimulus is transmitted from the eardrum through the\\nossicles to the oval window of the cochlea, some degree of hearing loss is inevitable. With conductive hearing\\n5.4 • Hearing 163\\nloss, hearing problems are associated with a failure in the vibration of the eardrum and/or movement of the\\nossicles. These problems are often dealt with through devices like hearing aids that amplify incoming sound\\nwaves to make vibration of the eardrum and movement of the ossicles more likely to occur.\\nWhen the hearing problem is associated with a failure to transmit neural signals from the cochlea to the brain,\\nit is called sensorineural hearing loss. One disease that results in sensorineural hearing loss is Ménière\\'s\\ndisease. Although not well understood, Ménière\\'s disease results in a degeneration of inner ear structures that\\ncan lead to hearing loss, tinnitus (constant ringing or buzzing), vertigo (a sense of spinning), and an increase\\nin pressure within the inner ear (Semaan & Megerian, 2011). This kind of loss cannot be treated with hearing\\naids, but some individuals might be candidates for a cochlear implant as a treatment option. Cochlear\\nimplants are electronic devices that consist of a microphone, a speech processor, and an electrode array. The\\ndevice receives incoming sound information and directly stimulates the auditory nerve to transmit\\ninformation to the brain.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nWatch this video about cochlear implant surgeries (http://openstax.org/l/cochlear) to learn more.\\nDeaf Culture\\nIn the United States and other places around the world, deaf people have their own language, schools, and\\ncustoms. This is called deaf culture. In the United States, deaf individuals often communicate using American\\nSign Language (ASL); ASL has no verbal component and is based entirely on visual signs and gestures. The\\nprimary mode of communication is signing. One of the values of deaf culture is to continue traditions like using\\nsign language rather than teaching deaf children to try to speak, read lips, or have cochlear implant surgery.\\nWhen a child is diagnosed as deaf, parents have difficult decisions to make. Should the child be enrolled in\\nmainstream schools and taught to verbalize and read lips? Or should the child be sent to a school for deaf\\nchildren to learn ASL and have significant exposure to deaf culture? Do you think there might be differences in\\nthe way that parents approach these decisions depending on whether or not they are also deaf?\\n5.5 The Other Senses\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Describe the basic functions of the chemical senses\\n• Explain the basic functions of the somatosensory, nociceptive, and thermoceptive sensory systems\\n• Describe the basic functions of the vestibular, proprioceptive, and kinesthetic sensory systems\\nVision and hearing have received an incredible amount of attention from researchers over the years. While\\nthere is still much to be learned about how these sensory systems work, we have a much better understanding\\nof them than of our other sensory modalities. In this section, we will explore our chemical senses (taste and\\nsmell) and our body senses (touch, temperature, pain, balance, and body position).\\nThe Chemical Senses\\nTaste (gustation) and smell (olfaction) are called chemical senses because both have sensory receptors that\\nrespond to molecules in the food we eat or in the air we breathe. There is a pronounced interaction between\\nour chemical senses. For example, when we describe the flavor of a given food, we are really referring to both\\ngustatory and olfactory properties of the food working in combination.\\nWHAT DO YOU THINK?\\n164 5 • Sensation and Perception\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nTaste (Gustation)\\nYou have learned since elementary school that there are four basic groupings of taste: sweet, salty, sour, and\\nbitter. Research demonstrates, however, that we have at least six taste groupings. Umami is our fifth taste.\\nUmami is actually a Japanese word that roughly translates to yummy, and it is associated with a taste for\\nmonosodium glutamate (Kinnamon & Vandenbeuch, 2009). There is also a growing body of experimental\\nevidence suggesting that we possess a taste for the fatty content of a given food (Mizushige, Inoue, & Fushiki,\\n2007).\\nMolecules from the food and beverages we consume dissolve in our saliva and interact with taste receptors on\\nour tongue and in our mouth and throat. Taste buds are formed by groupings of taste receptor cells with hair-\\nlike extensions that protrude into the central pore of the taste bud (Figure 5.21). Taste buds have a life cycle of\\nten days to two weeks, so even destroying some by burning your tongue won’t have any long-term effect; they\\njust grow right back. Taste molecules bind to receptors on this extension and cause chemical changes within\\nthe sensory cell that result in neural impulses being transmitted to the brain via different nerves, depending\\non where the receptor is located. Taste information is transmitted to the medulla, thalamus, and limbic\\nsystem, and to the gustatory cortex, which is tucked underneath the overlap between the frontal and temporal\\nlobes (Maffei, Haley, & Fontanini, 2012; Roper, 2013).\\nFIGURE 5.21 (a) Taste buds are composed of a number of individual taste receptors cells that transmit information\\nto nerves. (b) This micrograph shows a close-up view of the tongue’s surface. (credit a: modification of work by\\nJonas Töle; credit b: scale-bar data from Matt Russell)\\nSmell (Olfaction)\\nOlfactory receptor cells are located in a mucous membrane at the top of the nose. Small hair-like extensions\\nfrom these receptors serve as the sites for odor molecules dissolved in the mucus to interact with chemical\\nreceptors located on these extensions (Figure 5.22). Once an odor molecule has bound a given receptor,\\nchemical changes within the cell result in signals being sent to the olfactory bulb: a bulb-like structure at the\\ntip of the frontal lobe where the olfactory nerves begin. From the olfactory bulb, information is sent to regions\\nof the limbic system and to the primary olfactory cortex, which is located very near the gustatory cortex\\n(Lodovichi & Belluscio, 2012; Spors et al., 2013).\\n5.5 • The Other Senses 165\\nFIGURE 5.22 Olfactory receptors are the hair-like parts that extend from the olfactory bulb into the mucous\\nmembrane of the nasal cavity.\\nThere is tremendous variation in the sensitivity of the olfactory systems of different species. We often think of\\ndogs as having far superior olfactory systems than our own, and indeed, dogs can do some remarkable things\\nwith their noses. There is some evidence to suggest that dogs can “smell” dangerous drops in blood glucose\\nlevels as well as cancerous tumors (Wells, 2010). Dogs’ extraordinary olfactory abilities may be due to the\\nincreased number of functional genes for olfactory receptors (between 800 and 1200), compared to the fewer\\nthan 400 observed in humans and other primates (Niimura & Nei, 2007).\\nMany species respond to chemical messages, known as pheromones, sent by another individual (Wysocki &\\nPreti, 2004). Pheromonal communication often involves providing information about the reproductive status\\nof a potential mate. So, for example, when a female rat is ready to mate, it secretes pheromonal signals that\\ndraw attention from nearby male rats. Pheromonal activation is actually an important component in eliciting\\nsexual behavior in the male rat (Furlow, 1996, 2012; Purvis & Haynes, 1972; Sachs, 1997). There has also been\\na good deal of research (and controversy) about pheromones in humans (Comfort, 1971; Russell, 1976;\\nWolfgang-Kimball, 1992; Weller, 1998).\\nTouch, Thermoception, and Nociception\\nA number of receptors are distributed throughout the skin to respond to various touch-related stimuli (Figure\\n5.23). These receptors include Meissner’s corpuscles, Pacinian corpuscles, Merkel’s disks, and Ruffini\\ncorpuscles. Meissner’s corpuscles respond to pressure and lower frequency vibrations, and Pacinian\\ncorpuscles detect transient pressure and higher frequency vibrations. Merkel’s disks respond to light\\npressure, while Ruffini corpuscles detect stretch (Abraira & Ginty, 2013).\\n166 5 • Sensation and Perception\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\n', 'answer': \"Answer VERY concisely from the provided context only.

Context: FIGURE 3.6 In this Punnett square, N represents the normal allele, and p represents the recessive allele that is associated with PKU. If two individuals mate who are both heterozygous for the allele associated with PKU, their offspring have a 25% chance of expressing the PKU phenotype. Where do harmful genes that contribute to diseases like PKU come from? Gene mutations provide one source of harmful genes. A mutation is a sudden, permanent change in a gene. While many mutations can be harmful or lethal, once in a while, a mutation benefits an individual by giving that person an advantage over those who do not have the mutation. Recall that the theory of evolution asserts that individuals best adapted to their particular environments are more likely to reproduce and pass on their genes to future generations. In order for this process to occur, there must be competition—more technically, there must be variability in genes (and resultant traits) that allow for variation in adaptability to the environment. If a population consisted of identical individuals, then any dramatic changes in the environment would affect everyone in the same way, and there would be no variation in selection. In contrast, diversity in genes and associated traits allows some individuals to perform slightly better than others when faced with environmental change. This creates a distinct advantage for individuals best suited for their environments in terms of successful reproduction and genetic transmission. Human Diversity This chapter focuses on biology. Later in this course you will learn about social psychology and issues of race, prejudice, and discrimination. When we focus strictly on biology, race becomes a weak construct. After the sequencing of the human genome at the turn of the millennium, many scientists began to argue that race was not a useful variable in genetic research and that its continued use represents a potential source of confusion and harm. The racial categories that some believed to be helpful in studying genetic diversity in humans are largely irrelevant. A person's skin tone, eye color, and hair texture are functions of their genetic makeups, but there is actually more genetic variation within a given racial category than there is between racial categories. In some cases, focus on race has led to difficulties with misdiagnoses and/or misinterpretations of genetic data. For example, if a person is diagnosed with a genetic disorder, he or she may be misidentified as having a different disorder, such as cystic fibrosis or sickle cell anemia, when in fact the person has the disorder associated with his or her race (e.g., African American or Caucasian). In addition, some researchers have argued that discrimination against people of a particular race or ethnic group is based on racial stereotypes rather than biological differences. As a result, it is important to recognize that there are many different types of racial diversity, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.\", 'references': '{\"sections\": [\"States of Consciousness/Sleep and Why We Sleep\", \"Sensation and Perception\", \"Biopsychology/The Brain and Spinal Cord\"], \"pages\": [\"115\", \"176\", \"90\"]}'}\n",

Some people also experience altered states of consciousness through meditation, hypnosis, or\\nalcohol and other drugs.\\nThis chapter will discuss states of consciousness with a particular emphasis on sleep. The different stages of\\nsleep will be identified, and sleep disorders will be described. The chapter will close with discussions of altered\\nstates of consciousness produced by psychoactive drugs, hypnosis, and meditation.\\n4States of Consciousness\\n4.1 What Is Consciousness?\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Understand what is meant by consciousness\\n• Explain how circadian rhythms are involved in regulating the sleep-wake cycle, and how circadian cycles can be\\ndisrupted\\n• Discuss the concept of sleep debt\\nConsciousness describes our awareness of internal and external stimuli. Awareness of internal stimuli\\nincludes feeling pain, hunger, thirst, sleepiness, and being aware of our thoughts and emotions. Awareness of\\nexternal stimuli includes experiences such as seeing the light from the sun, feeling the warmth of a room, and\\nhearing the voice of a friend.\\nWe experience different states of consciousness and different levels of awareness on a regular basis. We might\\neven describe consciousness as a continuum that ranges from full awareness to a deep sleep. Sleep is a state\\nmarked by relatively low levels of physical activity and reduced sensory awareness that is distinct from periods\\nof rest that occur during wakefulness. Wakefulness is characterized by high levels of sensory awareness,\\nthought, and behavior. Beyond being awake or asleep, there are many other states of consciousness people\\nexperience. These include daydreaming, intoxication, and unconsciousness due to anesthesia. We might also\\nexperience unconscious states of being via drug-induced anesthesia for medical purposes. Often, we are not\\ncompletely aware of our surroundings, even when we are fully awake. For instance, have you ever daydreamed\\nwhile driving home from work or school without really thinking about the drive itself? You were capable of\\nengaging in the all of the complex tasks involved with operating a motor vehicle even though you were not\\naware of doing so. Many of these processes, like much of psychological behavior, are rooted in our biology.\\nBiological Rhythms\\nBiological rhythms are internal rhythms of biological activity. A woman’s menstrual cycle is an example of a\\nbiological rhythm—a recurring, cyclical pattern of bodily changes. One complete menstrual cycle takes about\\n28 days—a lunar month—but many biological cycles are much shorter. For example, body temperature\\nfluctuates cyclically over a 24-hour period (Figure 4.2). Alertness is associated with higher body temperatures,\\nand sleepiness with lower body temperatures.\\nFIGURE 4.2 This chart illustrates the circadian change in body temperature over 28 hours in a group of eight young\\nmen. Body temperature rises throughout the waking day, peaking in the afternoon, and falls during sleep with the\\nlowest point occurring during the very early morning hours.\\n110 4 • States of Consciousness\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nThis pattern of temperature fluctuation, which repeats every day, is one example of a circadian rhythm. A\\ncircadian rhythm is a biological rhythm that takes place over a period of about 24 hours. Our sleep-wake\\ncycle, which is linked to our environment’s natural light-dark cycle, is perhaps the most obvious example of a\\ncircadian rhythm, but we also have daily fluctuations in heart rate, blood pressure, blood sugar, and body\\ntemperature. Some circadian rhythms play a role in changes in our state of consciousness.\\nIf we have biological rhythms, then is there some sort of biological clock? In the brain, the hypothalamus,\\nwhich lies above the pituitary gland, is a main center of homeostasis. Homeostasis is the tendency to maintain\\na balance, or optimal level, within a biological system.\\nThe brain’s clock mechanism is located in an area of the hypothalamus known as the suprachiasmatic\\nnucleus (SCN). The axons of light-sensitive neurons in the retina provide information to the SCN based on the\\namount of light present, allowing this internal clock to be synchronized with the outside world (Klein, Moore, &\\nReppert, 1991; Welsh, Takahashi, & Kay, 2010) (Figure 4.3).\\nFIGURE 4.3 The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) serves as the brain’s clock mechanism. The clock sets itself with\\nlight information received through projections from the retina.\\nProblems With Circadian Rhythms\\nGenerally, and for most people, our circadian cycles are aligned with the outside world. For example, most\\npeople sleep during the night and are awake during the day. One important regulator of sleep-wake cycles is\\nthe hormone melatonin. The pineal gland, an endocrine structure located inside the brain that releases\\nmelatonin, is thought to be involved in the regulation of various biological rhythms and of the immune system\\nduring sleep (Hardeland, Pandi-Perumal, & Cardinali, 2006). Melatonin release is stimulated by darkness and\\ninhibited by light.\\nThere are individual differences in regard to our sleep-wake cycle. For instance, some people would say they\\nare morning people, while others would consider themselves to be night owls. These individual differences in\\ncircadian patterns of activity are known as a person’s chronotype, and research demonstrates that morning\\nlarks and night owls differ with regard to sleep regulation (Taillard, Philip, Coste, Sagaspe, & Bioulac, 2003).\\nSleep regulation refers to the brain’s control of switching between sleep and wakefulness as well as\\ncoordinating this cycle with the outside world.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nWatch this brief video about circadian rhythms and how they affect sleep (http://openstax.org/l/circadian) to\\nlearn more.\\n4.1 • What Is Consciousness? 111\\nInsufficient Sleep\\nWhen people have difficulty getting sleep due to their work or the demands of day-to-day life, they accumulate\\na sleep debt. A person with a sleep debt does not get sufficient sleep on a chronic basis. The consequences of\\nsleep debt include decreased levels of alertness and mental efficiency. Interestingly, since the advent of\\nelectric light, the amount of sleep that people get has declined. While we certainly welcome the convenience of\\nhaving the darkness lit up, we also suffer the consequences of reduced amounts of sleep because we are more\\nactive during the nighttime hours than our ancestors were. As a result, many of us sleep less than 7–8 hours a\\nnight and accrue a sleep debt. While there is tremendous variation in any given individual’s sleep needs, the\\nNational Sleep Foundation (n.d.) cites research to estimate that newborns require the most sleep (between 12\\nand 18 hours a night) and that this amount declines to just 7–9 hours by the time we are adults.\\nIf you lie down to take a nap and fall asleep very easily, chances are you may have sleep debt. Given that college\\nstudents are notorious for suffering from significant sleep debt (Hicks, Fernandez, & Pellegrini, 2001; Hicks,\\nJohnson, & Pellegrini, 1992; Miller, Shattuck, & Matsangas, 2010), chances are you and your classmates deal\\nwith sleep debt-related issues on a regular basis. In 2015, the National Sleep Foundation updated their sleep\\nduration hours, to better accommodate individual differences. Table 4.1 shows the new recommendations,\\nwhich describe sleep durations that are “recommended”, “may be appropriate”, and “not recommended”.\\nSleep Needs at Different Ages\\nAge Recommended May be appropriate Not recommended\\n0–3 months 14–17 hours 11–13 hours\\n18–19 hours\\nFewer than 11 hours\\nMore than 19 hours\\n4–11 months 12–15 hours 10–11 hours\\n16–18 hours\\nFewer than 10 hours\\nMore than 18 hours\\n1–2 years 11–14 hours 9–10 hours\\n15–16 hours\\nFewer than 9 hours\\nMore than 16 hours\\n3–5 years 10–13 hours 8–9 hours\\n14 hours\\nFewer than 8 hours\\nMore than 14 hours\\n6–13 years 9–11 hours 7–8 hours\\n12 hours\\nFewer than 7 hours\\nMore than 12 hours\\n14–17 years 8–10 hours 7 hours\\n11 hours\\nFewer than 7 hours\\nMore than 11 hours\\n18–25 years 7–9 hours 6 hours\\n10–11 hours\\nFewer than 6 hours\\nMore than 11 hours\\n26–64 years 7–9 hours 6 hours\\n10 hours\\nFewer than 6 hours\\nMore than 10 hours\\n≥65 years 7–8 hours 5–6 hours\\n9 hours\\nFewer than 5 hours\\nMore than 9 hours\\nTABLE 4.1\\nSleep debt and sleep deprivation have significant negative psychological and physiological consequences\\nFigure 4.5. As mentioned earlier, lack of sleep can result in decreased mental alertness and cognitive function.\\n4.1 • What Is Consciousness? 113\\nIn addition, sleep deprivation often results in depression-like symptoms. These effects can occur as a function\\nof accumulated sleep debt or in response to more acute periods of sleep deprivation. It may surprise you to\\nknow that sleep deprivation is associated with obesity, increased blood pressure, increased levels of stress\\nhormones, and reduced immune functioning (Banks & Dinges, 2007). A sleep deprived individual generally\\nwill fall asleep more quickly than if they were not sleep deprived. Some sleep-deprived individuals have\\ndifficulty staying awake when they stop moving (example sitting and watching television or driving a car). That\\nis why individuals suffering from sleep deprivation can also put themselves and others at risk when they put\\nthemselves behind the wheel of a car or work with dangerous machinery. Some research suggests that sleep\\ndeprivation affects cognitive and motor function as much as, if not more than, alcohol intoxication (Williamson\\n& Feyer, 2000). Research shows that the most severe effects of sleep deprivation occur when a person stays\\nawake for more than 24 hours (Killgore & Weber, 2014; Killgore et al., 2007), or following repeated nights with\\nfewer than four hours in bed (Wickens, Hutchins, Lauk, Seebook, 2015). For example, irritability, distractibility,\\nand impairments in cognitive and moral judgment can occur with fewer than four hours of sleep. If someone\\nstays awake for 48 consecutive hours, they could start to hallucinate.\\nFIGURE 4.5 This figure illustrates some of the negative consequences of sleep deprivation. While cognitive deficits\\nmay be the most obvious, many body systems are negatively impacted by lack of sleep.

When we are very young, we spend up to 16 hours a day\\nsleeping. As we grow older, we sleep less. In fact, a meta-analysis, which is a study that combines the results of\\nmany related studies, conducted within the last decade indicates that by the time we are 65 years old, we\\naverage fewer than 7 hours of sleep per day (Ohayon, Carskadon, Guilleminault, & Vitiello, 2004).\\n4.2 Sleep and Why We Sleep\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Describe areas of the brain involved in sleep\\n• Understand hormone secretions associated with sleep\\n• Describe several theories aimed at explaining the function of sleep\\n• Name and describe three theories about why we dream\\nWe spend approximately one-third of our lives sleeping. Given the average life expectancy for U.S. citizens falls\\n114 4 • States of Consciousness\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nbetween 73 and 79 years old (Singh & Siahpush, 2006), we can expect to spend approximately 25 years of our\\nlives sleeping. Some animals never sleep (e.g., some fish and amphibian species); other animals sleep very\\nlittle without apparent negative consequences (e.g., giraffes); yet some animals (e.g., rats) die after two weeks\\nof sleep deprivation (Siegel, 2008). Why do we devote so much time to sleeping? Is it absolutely essential that\\nwe sleep? This section will consider these questions and explore various explanations for why we sleep.\\nWhat is Sleep?\\nYou have read that sleep is distinguished by low levels of physical activity and reduced sensory awareness. As\\ndiscussed by Siegel (2008), a definition of sleep must also include mention of the interplay of the circadian and\\nhomeostatic mechanisms that regulate sleep. Homeostatic regulation of sleep is evidenced by sleep rebound\\nfollowing sleep deprivation. Sleep rebound refers to the fact that a sleep-deprived individual will fall asleep\\nmore quickly during subsequent opportunities for sleep. Sleep is characterized by certain patterns of activity\\nof the brain that can be visualized using electroencephalography (EEG), and different phases of sleep can be\\ndifferentiated using EEG as well.\\nSleep-wake cycles seem to be controlled by multiple brain areas acting in conjunction with one another. Some\\nof these areas include the thalamus, the hypothalamus, and the pons. As already mentioned, the\\nhypothalamus contains the SCN—the biological clock of the body—in addition to other nuclei that, in\\nconjunction with the thalamus, regulate slow-wave sleep. The pons is important for regulating rapid eye\\nmovement (REM) sleep (National Institutes of Health, n.d.).\\nSleep is also associated with the secretion and regulation of a number of hormones from several endocrine\\nglands including: melatonin, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and growth\\nhormone (National Institutes of Health, n.d.). You have read that the pineal gland releases melatonin during\\nsleep (Figure 4.6). Melatonin is thought to be involved in the regulation of various biological rhythms and the\\nimmune system (Hardeland et al., 2006). During sleep, the pituitary gland secretes both FSH and LH which are\\nimportant in regulating the reproductive system (Christensen et al., 2012; Sofikitis et al., 2008). The pituitary\\ngland also secretes growth hormone, during sleep, which plays a role in physical growth and maturation as\\nwell as other metabolic processes (Bartke, Sun, & Longo, 2013).\\nFIGURE 4.6 The pineal and pituitary glands secrete a number of hormones during sleep.\\nWhy Do We Sleep?\\nGiven the central role that sleep plays in our lives and the number of adverse consequences that have been\\nassociated with sleep deprivation, one would think that we would have a clear understanding of why it is that\\nwe sleep. Unfortunately, this is not the case; however, several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the\\nfunction of sleep.\\n4.2 • Sleep and Why We Sleep 115\\nAdaptive Function of Sleep\\nOne popular hypothesis of sleep incorporates the perspective of evolutionary psychology. Evolutionary\\npsychology is a discipline that studies how universal patterns of behavior and cognitive processes have\\nevolved over time as a result of natural selection. Variations and adaptations in cognition and behavior make\\nindividuals more or less successful in reproducing and passing their genes to their offspring. One hypothesis\\nfrom this perspective might argue that sleep is essential to restore resources that are expended during the day.\\nJust as bears hibernate in the winter when resources are scarce, perhaps people sleep at night to reduce their\\nenergy expenditures. While this is an intuitive explanation of sleep, there is little research that supports this\\nexplanation. In fact, it has been suggested that there is no reason to think that energetic demands could not be\\naddressed with periods of rest and inactivity (Frank, 2006; Rial et al., 2007), and some research has actually\\nfound a negative correlation between energetic demands and the amount of time spent sleeping (Capellini,\\nBarton, McNamara, Preston, & Nunn, 2008).\\nAnother evolutionary hypothesis of sleep holds that our sleep patterns evolved as an adaptive response to\\npredatory risks, which increase in darkness. Thus we sleep in safe areas to reduce the chance of harm. Again,\\nthis is an intuitive and appealing explanation for why we sleep. Perhaps our ancestors spent extended periods\\nof time asleep to reduce attention to themselves from potential predators. Comparative research indicates,\\nhowever, that the relationship that exists between predatory risk and sleep is very complex and equivocal.\\nSome research suggests that species that face higher predatory risks sleep fewer hours than other species\\n(Capellini et al., 2008), while other researchers suggest there is no relationship between the amount of time a\\ngiven species spends in deep sleep and its predation risk (Lesku, Roth, Amlaner, & Lima, 2006).\\nIt is quite possible that sleep serves no single universally adaptive function, and different species have evolved\\ndifferent patterns of sleep in response to their unique evolutionary pressures. While we have discussed the\\nnegative outcomes associated with sleep deprivation, it should be pointed out that there are many benefits that\\nare associated with adequate amounts of sleep. A few such benefits listed by the National Sleep Foundation\\n(n.d.) include maintaining healthy weight, lowering stress levels, improving mood, and increasing motor\\ncoordination, as well as a number of benefits related to cognition and memory formation.\\nCognitive Function of Sleep\\nAnother theory regarding why we sleep involves sleep’s importance for cognitive function and memory\\nformation (Rattenborg, Lesku, Martinez-Gonzalez, & Lima, 2007). Indeed, we know sleep deprivation results in\\ndisruptions in cognition and memory deficits (Brown, 2012), leading to impairments in our abilities to\\nmaintain attention, make decisions, and recall long-term memories. Moreover, these impairments become\\nmore severe as the amount of sleep deprivation increases (Alhola & Polo-Kantola, 2007). Furthermore, slow-\\nwave sleep after learning a new task can improve resultant performance on that task (Huber, Ghilardi,\\nMassimini, & Tononi, 2004) and seems essential for effective memory formation (Stickgold, 2005).\\nUnderstanding the impact of sleep on cognitive function should help you understand that cramming all night\\nfor a test may be not effective and can even prove counterproductive.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nWatch this brief video that gives sleep tips for college students (http://openstax.org/l/sleeptips) to learn more.\\nGetting the optimal amount of sleep has also been associated with other cognitive benefits. Research indicates\\nthat included among these possible benefits are increased capacities for creative thinking (Cai, Mednick,\\nHarrison, Kanady, & Mednick, 2009; Wagner, Gais, Haider, Verleger, & Born, 2004), language learning (Fenn,\\nNusbaum, & Margoliash, 2003; Gómez, Bootzin, & Nadel, 2006), and inferential judgments (Ellenbogen, Hu,\\nPayne, Titone, & Walker, 2007). It is possible that even the processing of emotional information is influenced by\\ncertain aspects of sleep (Walker, 2009).\\n116 4 • States of Consciousness\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nWatch this brief video about the relationship between sleep and memory (http://openstax.org/l/sleepmemory)\\nto learn more.\\n4.3 Stages of Sleep\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Differentiate between REM and non-REM sleep\\n• Describe the differences between the three stages of non-REM sleep\\n• Understand the role that REM and non-REM sleep play in learning and memory\\nSleep is not a uniform state of being. Instead, sleep is composed of several different stages that can be\\ndifferentiated from one another by the patterns of brain wave activity that occur during each stage. While\\nawake, our brain wave activity is dominated by beta waves. As compared to the brain wave patterns while\\nasleep, beta waves have the highest frequency (13–30 Hz) and lowest amplitude, and they tend to show more\\nvariability. As we begin to fall asleep, our brain wave activity changes. These changes can be visualized using\\nan EEG and are distinguished from one another by both the frequency and amplitude of the brain wave. The\\nfrequency of a brain wave is how many brain waves occur in a second, and frequency is measured in Hertz\\n(Hz). Amplitude is the height of the brain wave (Figure 4.7). Sleep can be divided into two different general\\nphases: REM sleep and non-REM (NREM) sleep. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is characterized by darting\\nmovements of the eyes under closed eyelids. Brain waves during REM sleep appear very similar to brain waves\\nduring wakefulness. In contrast, non-REM (NREM) sleep is subdivided into three stages distinguished from\\neach other and from wakefulness by characteristic patterns of brain waves. The first three stages of sleep are\\nNREM sleep, typically followed by REM sleep. In this section, we will discuss each of these stages of sleep and\\ntheir associated patterns of brain wave activity.\\nFIGURE 4.7 Brainwave activity changes dramatically across the different stages of sleep. (credit \"sleeping\":\\nmodification of work by Ryan Vaarsi)\\nNREM Stages of Sleep\\nAs we begin to fall asleep, we enter NREM sleep, and brain wave patterns decrease in frequency and increase\\nin amplitude. The first stage of NREM sleep is known as stage 1 sleep. Stage 1 sleep is a transitional phase that\\noccurs between wakefulness and sleep, the period during which we drift off to sleep. During this time, there is\\na slowdown in both the rates of respiration and heartbeat. In addition, stage 1 sleep involves a marked\\n4.3 • Stages of Sleep 117\\ndecrease in both overall muscle tension and core body temperature.\\nIn terms of brain wave activity, stage 1 sleep is associated with both alpha and theta waves. The early portion of\\nstage 1 sleep produces alpha waves. These patterns of electrical activity (waves) resemble that of someone\\nwho is very relaxed, yet awake, but they have less variability (are more synchronized) and are relatively lower\\nin frequency (8–12 Hz) and higher in amplitude than beta waves (Figure 4.8). As an individual continues\\nthrough stage 1 sleep, there is an increase in theta wave activity. Theta waves are even lower frequency (4–7\\nHz), and higher in amplitude, than the alpha wave patterns. It is relatively easy to wake someone from stage 1\\nsleep; in fact, people often report that they have not been asleep if they are awoken during stage 1 sleep.\\nFIGURE 4.8 Brainwave activity changes dramatically across the different stages of sleep.\\nAs we move into stage 2 sleep, the body goes into a state of deep relaxation. Theta waves still dominate the\\nactivity of the brain, but they are interrupted by brief bursts of activity known as sleep spindles (Figure 4.9). A\\nsleep spindle is a rapid burst of higher frequency brain waves that may be important for learning and memory\\n(Fogel & Smith, 2011; Poe, Walsh, & Bjorness, 2010). In addition, the appearance of K-complexes is often\\nassociated with stage 2 sleep. A K-complex is a very high amplitude pattern of brain activity that may in some\\ncases occur in response to environmental stimuli. Thus, K-complexes might serve as a bridge to higher levels\\nof arousal in response to what is going on in our environments (Halász, 1993; Steriade & Amzica, 1998).\\nFIGURE 4.9 Stage 2 sleep is characterized by the appearance of both sleep spindles and K-complexes.\\nNREM stage 3 sleep is often referred to as deep sleep or slow-wave sleep because this stage is characterized by\\nlow frequency (less than 3 Hz), high amplitude delta waves (Figure 4.10). These delta waves have the lowest\\nfrequency and highest amplitude of our sleeping brain wave patterns. During this time, an individual’s heart\\nrate and respiration slow dramatically, and it is much more difficult to awaken someone from sleep during\\n118 4 • States of Consciousness\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nstage 3 than during earlier stages. Interestingly, individuals who have increased levels of alpha brain wave\\nactivity (more often associated with wakefulness and transition into stage 1 sleep) during stage 3 often report\\nthat they do not feel refreshed upon waking, regardless of how long they slept (Stone, Taylor, McCrae, Kalsekar,\\n& Lichstein, 2008).\\nFIGURE 4.10 (a) Delta waves, which are low frequency and high amplitude, characterize (b) slow-wave stage 3 and\\nREM sleep.\\nREM Sleep\\nAs mentioned earlier, REM sleep is marked by rapid movements of the eyes. The brain waves associated with\\nthis stage of sleep are very similar to those observed when a person is awake, as shown in Figure 4.11, and this\\nis the period of sleep in which dreaming occurs. It is also associated with paralysis of muscle systems in the\\nbody with the exception of those that make circulation and respiration possible. Therefore, no movement of\\nvoluntary muscles occurs during REM sleep in a normal individual; REM sleep is often referred to as\\nparadoxical sleep because of this combination of high brain activity and lack of muscle tone. Like NREM sleep,\\nREM has been implicated in various aspects of learning and memory (Wagner, Gais, & Born, 2001; Siegel,\\n2001).\\nFIGURE 4.11 (a) A period of rapid eye movement is marked by the short red line segment. The brain waves\\nassociated with REM sleep, outlined in the red box in (a), look very similar to those seen (b) during wakefulness.\\nIf people are deprived of REM sleep and then allowed to sleep without disturbance, they will spend more time\\nin REM sleep in what would appear to be an effort to recoup the lost time in REM. This is known as the REM\\nrebound, and it suggests that REM sleep is also homeostatically regulated.

INTRODUCTION CHAPTER OUTLINE 4.1 What Is Consciousness? 4.2 Sleep and Why We Sleep 4.3 Stages of Sleep 4.4 Sleep Problems and Disorders 4.5 Substance Use and Abuse 4.6 Other States of Consciousness Our lives involve regular, dramatic changes in the degree to which we are aware of our surroundings and our internal states. While awake, we feel alert and aware of the many important things going on around us. Our experiences change dramatically while we are in deep sleep and once again when we are dreaming. Some people also experience altered states of consciousness through meditation, hypnosis, or alcohol and other drugs. This chapter will discuss states of consciousness with a particular emphasis on sleep. The different stages of sleep will be identified, and sleep disorders will be described. The chapter will close with discussions of altered states of consciousness produced by psychoactive drugs, hypnosis, and meditation. 4States of Consciousness 4.1 What Is Conscious Consciousness is the ability to perceive and understand the world around you. It is also the capacity to make decisions about what to do and how to act in order to achieve your goals. In this chapter, the term “consciousness” will be used to refer to both the state of being conscious and the process of making conscious decisions. The word consciousness is derived from two Greek words: κόσμος (kosmos), which means “world” or “universe,” and ἀναστήσειν (anastēsēn), meaning “to make aware.” In other words, consciousness refers to the awareness of one’s surroundings and of oneself as a part of that world. This awareness can be divided into three categories: (1) sensory awareness, (2) self-awareness (or self-consciousness), and (3) cognitive awareness. Sensory awareness is what we see, hear, touch, taste, smell, feel, think, remember, imagine, experience, and so on. Self-conscious awareness involves knowing who you are and what you think and feel. Cognitive awareness involves being able to understand and make sense of information that you receive from your senses and from other sources, such as books, magazines, newspapers, TV, radio, movies, music, books, or the Internet. These three categories of awareness are not mutually exclusive. For example, some people may have a high level of sensory and selfconscious awareness while having low levels of cognitive and emotional awareness. Others may have low sensory, but high self and cognitive consciousness. Still others may have high sensory consciousness but low self, cognitive or emotional consciousness. In addition to these categories, there are two other types of conscious awareness that are important to understand. One is called reflective awareness (also known as introspection or self-reflection). The other is called experiential awareness or subjective experience. Reflective awareness occurs when you pay attention to your own thoughts, feelings, perceptions, sensations, memories, emotions, thoughts about your thoughts, feelings about yourself, etc. When you reflect on yourself and your experiences, it is possible to gain a better understanding of yourself. On the other hand, experiencing is when your attention is focused on something that is happening to you or something that has happened to someone else. Experiencing is often associated with feelings of sadness, anger, fear, anxiety, joy, happiness, sadness', 'references': '{\"sections\": [\"States of Consciousness/Substance Use and Abuse\", \"States of Consciousness/Sleep Problems and Disorders\"], \"pages\": [\"127\", \"129\", \"121\"]}'}\n",
      "Response for query ID 4: {'context': 'FIGURE 6.8 John B. Watson used the principles of classical conditioning in the study of human emotion.\\nWatson’s ideas were influenced by Pavlov’s work. According to Watson, human behavior, just like animal\\nbehavior, is primarily the result of conditioned responses. Whereas Pavlov’s work with dogs involved the\\nconditioning of reflexes, Watson believed the same principles could be extended to the conditioning of human\\nemotions (Watson, 1919).\\nIn 1920, while chair of the psychology department at Johns Hopkins University, Watson and his graduate\\nstudent, Rosalie Rayner, conducted research on a baby nicknamed Little Albert. Rayner and Watson’s\\nexperiments with Little Albert demonstrated how fears can be conditioned using classical conditioning.\\nThrough these experiments, Little Albert was exposed to and conditioned to fear certain things. Initially he was\\npresented with various neutral stimuli, including a rabbit, a dog, a monkey, masks, cotton wool, and a white\\nrat. He was not afraid of any of these things. Then Watson, with the help of Rayner, conditioned Little Albert to\\nassociate these stimuli with an emotion—fear. For example, Watson handed Little Albert the white rat, and\\nLittle Albert enjoyed playing with it. Then Watson made a loud sound, by striking a hammer against a metal\\nbar hanging behind Little Albert’s head, each time Little Albert touched the rat. Little Albert was frightened by\\nthe sound—demonstrating a reflexive fear of sudden loud noises—and began to cry. Watson repeatedly paired\\nthe loud sound with the white rat. Soon Little Albert became frightened by the white rat alone. In this case,\\nwhat are the UCS, CS, UCR, and CR? Days later, Little Albert demonstrated stimulus generalization—he became\\nafraid of other furry things: a rabbit, a furry coat, and even a Santa Claus mask (Figure 6.9). Watson had\\nsucceeded in conditioning a fear response in Little Albert, thus demonstrating that emotions could become\\nconditioned responses. It had been Watson’s intention to produce a phobia—a persistent, excessive fear of a\\nspecific object or situation— through conditioning alone, thus countering Freud’s view that phobias are caused\\nby deep, hidden conflicts in the mind. However, there is no evidence that Little Albert experienced phobias in\\nlater years. Little Albert’s mother moved away, ending the experiment. While Watson’s research provided new\\ninsight into conditioning, it would be considered unethical by today’s standards.\\nFIGURE 6.9 Through stimulus generalization, Little Albert came to fear furry things, including Watson in a Santa\\nClaus mask.\\n6.2 • Classical Conditioning 191\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nView scenes from this video on John Watson’s experiment in which Little Albert was conditioned to respond in\\nfear to furry objects (http://openstax.org/l/Watson1) to learn more.\\nAs you watch the video, look closely at Little Albert’s reactions and the manner in which Watson and Rayner\\npresent the stimuli before and after conditioning. Based on what you see, would you come to the same\\nconclusions as the researchers?\\nAdvertising and Associative Learning\\nAdvertising executives are pros at applying the principles of associative learning. Think about the car\\ncommercials you have seen on television. Many of them feature an attractive model. By associating the model\\nwith the car being advertised, you come to see the car as being desirable (Cialdini, 2008). You may be asking\\nyourself, does this advertising technique actually work? According to Cialdini (2008), men who viewed a car\\ncommercial that included an attractive model later rated the car as being faster, more appealing, and better\\ndesigned than did men who viewed an advertisement for the same car minus the model.\\nHave you ever noticed how quickly advertisers cancel contracts with a famous athlete following a scandal? As far\\nas the advertiser is concerned, that athlete is no longer associated with positive feelings; therefore, the athlete\\ncannot be used as an unconditioned stimulus to condition the public to associate positive feelings (the\\nunconditioned response) with their product (the conditioned stimulus).\\nNow that you are aware of how associative learning works, see if you can find examples of these types of\\nadvertisements on television, in magazines, or on the Internet.\\n6.3 Operant Conditioning\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Define operant conditioning\\n• Explain the difference between reinforcement and punishment\\n• Distinguish between reinforcement schedules\\nThe previous section of this chapter focused on the type of associative learning known as classical\\nconditioning. Remember that in classical conditioning, something in the environment triggers a reflex\\nautomatically, and researchers train the organism to react to a different stimulus. Now we turn to the second\\ntype of associative learning, operant conditioning. In operant conditioning, organisms learn to associate a\\nbehavior and its consequence (Table 6.1). A pleasant consequence makes that behavior more likely to be\\nrepeated in the future. For example, Spirit, a dolphin at the National Aquarium in Baltimore, does a flip in the\\nair when her trainer blows a whistle. The consequence is that she gets a fish.\\nEVERYDAY CONNECTION\\n192 6 • Learning\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nClassical and Operant Conditioning Compared\\nClassical Conditioning Operant Conditioning\\nConditioning\\napproach\\nAn unconditioned stimulus (such as food) is paired\\nwith a neutral stimulus (such as a bell). The neutral\\nstimulus eventually becomes the conditioned\\nstimulus, which brings about the conditioned\\nresponse (salivation).\\nThe target behavior is followed by\\nreinforcement or punishment to either\\nstrengthen or weaken it, so that the\\nlearner is more likely to exhibit the desired\\nbehavior in the future.\\nStimulus\\ntiming\\nThe stimulus occurs immediately before the\\nresponse.\\nThe stimulus (either reinforcement or\\npunishment) occurs soon after the\\nresponse.\\nTABLE 6.1\\nPsychologist B. F. Skinner saw that classical conditioning is limited to existing behaviors that are reflexively\\nelicited, and it doesn’t account for new behaviors such as riding a bike. He proposed a theory about how such\\nbehaviors come about. Skinner believed that behavior is motivated by the consequences we receive for the\\nbehavior: the reinforcements and punishments. His idea that learning is the result of consequences is based\\non the law of effect, which was first proposed by psychologist Edward Thorndike. According to the law of\\neffect, behaviors that are followed by consequences that are satisfying to the organism are more likely to be\\nrepeated, and behaviors that are followed by unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated\\n(Thorndike, 1911). Essentially, if an organism does something that brings about a desired result, the organism\\nis more likely to do it again. If an organism does something that does not bring about a desired result, the\\norganism is less likely to do it again. An example of the law of effect is in employment. One of the reasons (and\\noften the main reason) we show up for work is because we get paid to do so. If we stop getting paid, we will\\nlikely stop showing up—even if we love our job.\\nWorking with Thorndike’s law of effect as his foundation, Skinner began conducting scientific experiments on\\nanimals (mainly rats and pigeons) to determine how organisms learn through operant conditioning (Skinner,\\n1938). He placed these animals inside an operant conditioning chamber, which has come to be known as a\\n“Skinner box” (Figure 6.10). A Skinner box contains a lever (for rats) or disk (for pigeons) that the animal can\\npress or peck for a food reward via the dispenser. Speakers and lights can be associated with certain behaviors.\\nA recorder counts the number of responses made by the animal.\\nFIGURE 6.10 (a) B. F. Skinner developed operant conditioning for systematic study of how behaviors are\\nstrengthened or weakened according to their consequences.

In operant conditioning, positive and negative do not mean good and\\nbad. Instead, positive means you are adding something, and negative means you are taking something away.\\nReinforcement means you are increasing a behavior, and punishment means you are decreasing a behavior.\\nReinforcement can be positive or negative, and punishment can also be positive or negative. All reinforcers\\n(positive or negative) increase the likelihood of a behavioral response. All punishers (positive or negative)\\ndecrease the likelihood of a behavioral response. Now let’s combine these four terms: positive reinforcement,\\nnegative reinforcement, positive punishment, and negative punishment (Table 6.2).\\nPositive and Negative Reinforcement and Punishment\\nReinforcement Punishment\\nPositive Something is added to increase the likelihood of a\\nbehavior.\\nSomething is added to decrease the likelihood of a\\nbehavior.\\nNegative Something is removed to increase the likelihood\\nof a behavior.\\nSomething is removed to decrease the likelihood\\nof a behavior.\\nTABLE 6.2\\nReinforcement\\nThe most effective way to teach a person or animal a new behavior is with positive reinforcement. In positive\\nreinforcement, a desirable stimulus is added to increase a behavior.\\nFor example, you tell your five-year-old son, Jerome, that if he cleans his room, he will get a toy. Jerome quickly\\ncleans his room because he wants a new art set. Let’s pause for a moment. Some people might say, “Why\\nshould I reward my child for doing what is expected?” But in fact we are constantly and consistently rewarded\\nin our lives. Our paychecks are rewards, as are high grades and acceptance into our preferred school. Being\\npraised for doing a good job and for passing a driver’s test is also a reward. Positive reinforcement as a\\nlearning tool is extremely effective. It has been found that one of the most effective ways to increase\\nachievement in school districts with below-average reading scores was to pay the children to read. Specifically,\\nsecond-grade students in Dallas were paid $2 each time they read a book and passed a short quiz about the\\nbook. The result was a significant increase in reading comprehension (Fryer, 2010). What do you think about\\nthis program? If Skinner were alive today, he would probably think this was a great idea. He was a strong\\nproponent of using operant conditioning principles to influence students’ behavior at school. In fact, in\\naddition to the Skinner box, he also invented what he called a teaching machine that was designed to reward\\nsmall steps in learning (Skinner, 1961)—an early forerunner of computer-assisted learning. His teaching\\nmachine tested students’ knowledge as they worked through various school subjects. If students answered\\nquestions correctly, they received immediate positive reinforcement and could continue; if they answered\\nincorrectly, they did not receive any reinforcement. The idea was that students would spend additional time\\nstudying the material to increase their chance of being reinforced the next time (Skinner, 1961).\\nIn negative reinforcement, an undesirable stimulus is removed to increase a behavior. For example, car\\nmanufacturers use the principles of negative reinforcement in their seatbelt systems, which go “beep, beep,\\nbeep” until you fasten your seatbelt. The annoying sound stops when you exhibit the desired behavior,\\n194 6 • Learning\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nincreasing the likelihood that you will buckle up in the future. Negative reinforcement is also used frequently\\nin horse training. Riders apply pressure—by pulling the reins or squeezing their legs—and then remove the\\npressure when the horse performs the desired behavior, such as turning or speeding up. The pressure is the\\nnegative stimulus that the horse wants to remove.\\nPunishment\\nMany people confuse negative reinforcement with punishment in operant conditioning, but they are two very\\ndifferent mechanisms. Remember that reinforcement, even when it is negative, always increases a behavior. In\\ncontrast, punishment always decreases a behavior. In positive punishment, you add an undesirable stimulus\\nto decrease a behavior. An example of positive punishment is scolding a student to get the student to stop\\ntexting in class. In this case, a stimulus (the reprimand) is added in order to decrease the behavior (texting in\\nclass). In negative punishment, you remove a pleasant stimulus to decrease behavior. For example, when a\\nchild misbehaves, a parent can take away a favorite toy. In this case, a stimulus (the toy) is removed in order to\\ndecrease the behavior.\\nPunishment, especially when it is immediate, is one way to decrease undesirable behavior. For example,\\nimagine your four-year-old son, Brandon, hit his younger brother. You have Brandon write 100 times “I will not\\nhit my brother\" (positive punishment). Chances are he won’t repeat this behavior. While strategies like this are\\ncommon today, in the past children were often subject to physical punishment, such as spanking. It’s\\nimportant to be aware of some of the drawbacks in using physical punishment on children. First, punishment\\nmay teach fear. Brandon may become fearful of the street, but he also may become fearful of the person who\\ndelivered the punishment—you, his parent. Similarly, children who are punished by teachers may come to fear\\nthe teacher and try to avoid school (Gershoff et al., 2010). Consequently, most schools in the United States have\\nbanned corporal punishment. Second, punishment may cause children to become more aggressive and prone\\nto antisocial behavior and delinquency (Gershoff, 2002). They see their parents resort to spanking when they\\nbecome angry and frustrated, so, in turn, they may act out this same behavior when they become angry and\\nfrustrated. For example, because you spank Brenda when you are angry with her for her misbehavior, she\\nmight start hitting her friends when they won’t share their toys.\\nWhile positive punishment can be effective in some cases, Skinner suggested that the use of punishment\\nshould be weighed against the possible negative effects. Today’s psychologists and parenting experts favor\\nreinforcement over punishment—they recommend that you catch your child doing something good and reward\\nthem for it.\\nShaping\\nIn his operant conditioning experiments, Skinner often used an approach called shaping. Instead of rewarding\\nonly the target behavior, in shaping, we reward successive approximations of a target behavior. Why is shaping\\nneeded? Remember that in order for reinforcement to work, the organism must first display the behavior.\\nShaping is needed because it is extremely unlikely that an organism will display anything but the simplest of\\nbehaviors spontaneously. In shaping, behaviors are broken down into many small, achievable steps. The\\nspecific steps used in the process are the following:\\n1. Reinforce any response that resembles the desired behavior.\\n2. Then reinforce the response that more closely resembles the desired behavior. You will no longer reinforce\\nthe previously reinforced response.\\n3. Next, begin to reinforce the response that even more closely resembles the desired behavior.\\n4. Continue to reinforce closer and closer approximations of the desired behavior.\\n5. Finally, only reinforce the desired behavior.\\nShaping is often used in teaching a complex behavior or chain of behaviors. Skinner used shaping to teach\\npigeons not only such relatively simple behaviors as pecking a disk in a Skinner box, but also many unusual\\nand entertaining behaviors, such as turning in circles, walking in figure eights, and even playing ping pong; the\\n6.3 • Operant Conditioning 195\\nbeen a prosocial model in your life?\\nThe antisocial effects of observational learning are also worth mentioning. As you saw from the example of\\nClaire at the beginning of this section, her daughter viewed Claire’s aggressive behavior and copied it.\\nResearch suggests that this may help to explain why victims of abuse often grow up to be abusers themselves\\n(Murrell, Christoff, & Henning, 2007). In fact, about 30% of child abuse victims become abusive parents (U.S.\\nDepartment of Health & Human Services, 2013). We tend to do what we know. Children who grow up\\nwitnessing their parents deal with anger and frustration through violent and aggressive acts often learn to\\nbehave in that manner themselves.\\nSome studies suggest that violent television shows, movies, and video games may also have antisocial effects\\n(Figure 6.18) although further research needs to be done to understand the correlational and causational\\naspects of media violence and behavior. Some studies have found a link between viewing violence and\\naggression seen in children (Anderson & Gentile, 2008; Kirsch, 2010; Miller, Grabell, Thomas, Bermann, &\\nGraham-Bermann, 2012). These findings may not be surprising, given that a child graduating from high school\\nhas been exposed to around 200,000 violent acts including murder, robbery, torture, bombings, beatings, and\\nrape through various forms of media (Huston et al., 1992). Not only might viewing media violence affect\\naggressive behavior by teaching people to act that way in real life situations, but it has also been suggested that\\nrepeated exposure to violent acts also desensitizes people to it. Psychologists are working to understand this\\ndynamic.\\nFIGURE 6.18 Can viewing violent media make us violent? Psychological researchers study this topic.

However, studies by\\nChristopher Ferguson and others suggests that while there may be a link between violent media exposure and\\naggression, research to date has not accounted for other risk factors for aggression including mental health and\\nfamily life (Ferguson, 2011; Gentile, 2016).

In contrast,\\nlearning is a change in behavior or knowledge that results from experience. There are three main types of\\nlearning: classical conditioning, operant conditioning, and observational learning. Both classical and operant\\nconditioning are forms of associative learning where associations are made between events that occur\\ntogether. Observational learning is just as it sounds: learning by observing others.\\n6.2 Classical Conditioning\\nPavlov’s pioneering work with dogs contributed greatly to what we know about learning. His experiments\\nexplored the type of associative learning we now call classical conditioning. In classical conditioning,\\norganisms learn to associate events that repeatedly happen together, and researchers study how a reflexive\\nresponse to a stimulus can be mapped to a different stimulus—by training an association between the two\\nstimuli. Pavlov’s experiments show how stimulus-response bonds are formed. Watson, the founder of\\nbehaviorism, was greatly influenced by Pavlov’s work. He tested humans by conditioning fear in an infant\\nknown as Little Albert. His findings suggest that classical conditioning can explain how some fears develop.\\n6.3 Operant Conditioning\\nOperant conditioning is based on the work of B. F. Skinner. Operant conditioning is a form of learning in which\\nthe motivation for a behavior happens after the behavior is demonstrated. An animal or a human receives a\\nconsequence after performing a specific behavior. The consequence is either a reinforcer or a punisher. All\\nreinforcement (positive or negative) increases the likelihood of a behavioral response. All punishment\\n(positive or negative) decreases the likelihood of a behavioral response. Several types of reinforcement\\nschedules are used to reward behavior depending on either a set or variable period of time.\\n6.4 Observational Learning (Modeling)\\nAccording to Bandura, learning can occur by watching others and then modeling what they do or say. This is\\nknown as observational learning. There are specific steps in the process of modeling that must be followed if\\nlearning is to be successful. These steps include attention, retention, reproduction, and motivation. Through\\nmodeling, Bandura has shown that children learn many things both good and bad simply by watching their\\nparents, siblings, and others.\\nReview Questions\\n1.

Watson used the principles of classical conditioning in the study of human emotion. Watson’s ideas were influenced by Pavlov’s work. According to Watson, human behavior, just like animal behavior, is primarily the result of conditioned responses. Whereas Pavlov’s work with dogs involved the conditioning of reflexes, Watson believed the same principles could be extended to the conditioning of human emotions (Watson, 1919). In 1920, while chair of the psychology department at Johns Hopkins University, Watson and his graduate student, Rosalie Rayner, conducted research on a baby nicknamed Little Albert. Rayner and Watson’s experiments with Little Albert demonstrated how fears can be conditioned using classical conditioning. Through these experiments, Little Albert was exposed to and conditioned to fear certain things. Initially he was presented with various neutral stimuli, including a rabbit, a dog, a monkey, masks, cotton wool, and a white rat. He was not afraid of any of these things. Then Watson, with the help of Rayner, conditioned Little Albert to associate these stimuli with an emotion—fear. For example, Watson handed Little Albert the white rat, and Little Albert enjoyed playing with it. Then Watson made a loud sound, by striking a hammer against a metal bar hanging behind Little Albert’s head, each time Little Albert touched the rat. Little Albert was frightened by the sound—demonstrating a reflexive fear of sudden loud noises—and began to cry. Watson repeatedly paired the loud sound with the white rat. Soon Little Albert became frightened by the white rat alone. In this case, what are the UCS, CS, UCR, and CR? Days later, Little Albert demonstrated stimulus generalization—he became afraid of other furry things: a rabbit, a furry coat, and even a Santa Claus mask (Figure 6.9). Watson had succeeded in conditioning a fear response in Little Albert, thus demonstrating that emotions could become conditioned responses. It had been Watson’s intention to produce a phobia—a persistent, excessive fear of a specific object or situation— through conditioning alone, thus countering Freud’s view that phobias are caused by deep, hidden conflicts in the unconscious mind. However, his experiments showed that fear could also be caused by a conditioned response to a neutral stimulus, such as a sound or a mask. This was the first experiment to show that conditioning could produce fear responses in humans. (For more information, see Chapter 7, “Classical Conditioning,” and Chapter 8, \"Conditioned Reflexes.”) Answer: The UCS is the conditioned stimulus (CS), and the CS is a stimulus that elicits a response (UCR). The CR is the response that is elicited (CR). In other words, UCS = CS = CR. Question: What did Watson use to study human emotions? Answer: Classical conditioning Question: How did he conduct the experiments? What were the results of his research? (Hint: Use the text to answer this question.) Answer: Watsons experiments were conducted using the principle of conditioning, which is based on the idea that certain stimuli can become associated with certain emotions or behaviors. The experiments involved exposing Little Albert to various stimuli and conditioning him to associate them with a specific emotion. Specifically, he was presented with different types of stimuli (e.g., rabbits, dogs, monkeys, etc.) and was then conditioned to associate each stimulus with fear. Over time, the association between the stimulus and fear became stronger and more pronounced, demonstrating the effectiveness of this conditioning technique in producing fear responses. As a result, it was Watson\\'s intention that humans could learn to respond to certain stimuli with fear, thereby counteracting the influence of Freud\\'s psychoanalytic theory that suggested deep unconscious conflicts were at the root of many psychological disorders.

      "Response for query ID 5: {'context': 'LINK T O LEARNING\\nWatch this video about how babies lose the ability to discriminate among all possible human phonemes as they\\nage (http://openstax.org/l/language) to learn more.\\nAfter the first few months of life, babies enter what is known as the babbling stage, during which time they tend\\nto produce single syllables that are repeated over and over. As time passes, more variations appear in the\\nsyllables that they produce. During this time, it is unlikely that the babies are trying to communicate; they are\\njust as likely to babble when they are alone as when they are with their caregivers (Fernández & Cairns, 2011).\\nInterestingly, babies who are raised in environments in which sign language is used will also begin to show\\nbabbling in the gestures of their hands during this stage (Petitto, Holowka, Sergio, Levy, & Ostry, 2004).\\nGenerally, a child’s first word is uttered sometime between the ages of 1 year to 18 months, and for the next few\\nmonths, the child will remain in the “one word” stage of language development. During this time, children\\nknow a number of words, but they only produce one-word utterances. The child’s early vocabulary is limited to\\nfamiliar objects or events, often nouns. Although children in this stage only make one-word utterances, these\\nwords often carry larger meaning (Fernández & Cairns, 2011). So, for example, a child saying “cookie” could be\\nidentifying a cookie or asking for a cookie.\\nAs a child’s lexicon grows, they begin to utter simple sentences and to acquire new vocabulary at a very rapid\\npace. In addition, children begin to demonstrate a clear understanding of the specific rules that apply to their\\nlanguage(s). Even the mistakes that children sometimes make provide evidence of just how much they\\nunderstand about those rules. This is sometimes seen in the form of overgeneralization. In this context,\\novergeneralization refers to an extension of a language rule to an exception to the rule. For example, in\\nEnglish, it is usually the case that an “s” is added to the end of a word to indicate plurality. For example, we\\nspeak of one dog versus two dogs. Young children will overgeneralize this rule to cases that are exceptions to\\nthe “add an s to the end of the word” rule and say things like “those two gooses” or “three mouses.” Clearly, the\\nrules of the language are understood, even if the exceptions to the rules are still being learned (Moskowitz,\\n1978).\\nLanguage and Thought\\nWhen we speak one language, we agree that words are representations of ideas, people, places, and events. The\\ngiven language that children learn is connected to their culture and surroundings. But can words themselves\\nshape the way we think about things? Psychologists have long investigated the question of whether language\\nshapes thoughts and actions, or whether our thoughts and beliefs shape our language. Two researchers,\\nEdward Sapir and Benjamin Lee Whorf, began this investigation in the 1940s. They wanted to understand how\\nthe language habits of a community encourage members of that community to interpret language in a\\nparticular manner (Sapir, 1941/1964). Sapir and Whorf proposed that language determines thought. For\\nexample, in some languages there are many different words for love. However, in English we use the word love\\nfor all types of love. Does this affect how we think about love depending on the language that we speak (Whorf,\\n1956)? Researchers have since identified this view as too absolute, pointing out a lack of empiricism behind\\nwhat Sapir and Whorf proposed (Abler, 2013; Boroditsky, 2011; van Troyer, 1994). Today, psychologists\\ncontinue to study and debate the relationship between language and thought.\\nThe Meaning of Language\\nThink about what you know of other languages; perhaps you even speak multiple languages. Imagine for a\\nmoment that your closest friend fluently speaks more than one language. Do you think that friend thinks\\ndifferently, depending on which language is being spoken? You may know a few words that are not translatable\\nWHAT DO YOU THINK?\\n220 7 • Thinking and Intelligence\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nfrom their original language into English. For example, the Portuguese word saudade originated during the 15th\\ncentury, when Portuguese sailors left home to explore the seas and travel to Africa or Asia. Those left behind\\ndescribed the emptiness and fondness they felt as saudade (Figure 7.6). The word came to express many\\nmeanings, including loss, nostalgia, yearning, warm memories, and hope. There is no single word in English that\\nincludes all of those emotions in a single description. Do words such as saudade indicate that different languages\\nproduce different patterns of thought in people? What do you think??\\nFIGURE 7.6 These two works of art depict saudade. (a) Saudade de Nápoles, which is translated into “missing\\nNaples,” was painted by Bertha Worms in 1895. (b) Almeida Júnior painted Saudade in 1899.\\nLanguage may indeed influence the way that we think, an idea known as linguistic determinism. One recent\\ndemonstration of this phenomenon involved differences in the way that English and Mandarin Chinese\\nspeakers talk and think about time. English speakers tend to talk about time using terms that describe\\nchanges along a horizontal dimension, for example, saying something like “I’m running behind schedule” or\\n“Don’t get ahead of yourself.” While Mandarin Chinese speakers also describe time in horizontal terms, it is not\\nuncommon to also use terms associated with a vertical arrangement. For example, the past might be described\\nas being “up” and the future as being “down.” It turns out that these differences in language translate into\\ndifferences in performance on cognitive tests designed to measure how quickly an individual can recognize\\ntemporal relationships. Specifically, when given a series of tasks with vertical priming, Mandarin Chinese\\nspeakers were faster at recognizing temporal relationships between months. Indeed, Boroditsky (2001) sees\\nthese results as suggesting that “habits in language encourage habits in thought” (p. 12).\\nOne group of researchers who wanted to investigate how language influences thought compared how English\\nspeakers and the Dani people of Papua New Guinea think and speak about color. The Dani have two words for\\ncolor: one word for light and one word for dark. In contrast, the English language has 11 color words.\\nResearchers hypothesized that the number of color terms could limit the ways that the Dani people\\nconceptualized color. However, the Dani were able to distinguish colors with the same ability as English\\nspeakers, despite having fewer words at their disposal (Berlin & Kay, 1969). A recent review of research aimed\\nat determining how language might affect something like color perception suggests that language can\\ninfluence perceptual phenomena, especially in the left hemisphere of the brain. You may recall from earlier\\nchapters that the left hemisphere is associated with language for most people. However, the right (less\\n7.2 • Language 221\\nlinguistic hemisphere) of the brain is less affected by linguistic influences on perception (Regier & Kay, 2009)\\n7.3 Problem Solving\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Describe problem solving strategies\\n• Define algorithm and heuristic\\n• Explain some common roadblocks to effective problem solving and decision making\\nPeople face problems every day—usually, multiple problems throughout the day. Sometimes these problems\\nare straightforward: To double a recipe for pizza dough, for example, all that is required is that each ingredient\\nin the recipe be doubled. Sometimes, however, the problems we encounter are more complex. For example,\\nsay you have a work deadline, and you must mail a printed copy of a report to your supervisor by the end of the\\nbusiness day. The report is time-sensitive and must be sent overnight. You finished the report last night, but\\nyour printer will not work today. What should you do? First, you need to identify the problem and then apply a\\nstrategy for solving the problem.\\nProblem-Solving Strategies\\nWhen you are presented with a problem—whether it is a complex mathematical problem or a broken printer,\\nhow do you solve it? Before finding a solution to the problem, the problem must first be clearly identified. After\\nthat, one of many problem solving strategies can be applied, hopefully resulting in a solution.\\nA problem-solving strategy is a plan of action used to find a solution. Different strategies have different action\\nplans associated with them (Table 7.2). For example, a well-known strategy is trial and error. The old adage,\\n“If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again” describes trial and error. In terms of your broken printer, you could\\ntry checking the ink levels, and if that doesn’t work, you could check to make sure the paper tray isn’t jammed.\\nOr maybe the printer isn’t actually connected to your laptop. When using trial and error, you would continue to\\ntry different solutions until you solved your problem. Although trial and error is not typically one of the most\\ntime-efficient strategies, it is a commonly used one.\\nProblem-Solving Strategies\\nMethod Description Example\\nTrial and\\nerror\\nContinue trying different\\nsolutions until problem is solved\\nRestarting phone, turning off WiFi, turning off bluetooth in order\\nto determine why your phone is malfunctioning\\nAlgorithm Step-by-step problem-solving\\nformula Instructional video for installing new software on your computer\\nHeuristic General problem-solving\\nframework Working backwards; breaking a task into steps\\nTABLE 7.2\\nAnother type of strategy is an algorithm. An algorithm is a problem-solving formula that provides you with\\nstep-by-step instructions used to achieve a desired outcome (Kahneman, 2011). You can think of an algorithm\\nas a recipe with highly detailed instructions that produce the same result every time they are performed.\\nAlgorithms are used frequently in our everyday lives, especially in computer science. When you run a search\\non the Internet, search engines like Google use algorithms to decide which entries will appear first in your list\\nof results. Facebook also uses algorithms to decide which posts to display on your newsfeed. Can you identify\\nother situations in which algorithms are used?\\n222 7 • Thinking and Intelligence\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nA heuristic is another type of problem solving strategy. While an algorithm must be followed exactly to produce\\na correct result, a heuristic is a general problem-solving framework (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). You can\\nthink of these as mental shortcuts that are used to solve problems. A “rule of thumb” is an example of a\\nheuristic. Such a rule saves the person time and energy when making a decision, but despite its time-saving\\ncharacteristics, it is not always the best method for making a rational decision. Different types of heuristics are\\nused in different types of situations, but the impulse to use a heuristic occurs when one of five conditions is\\nmet (Pratkanis, 1989):\\n• When one is faced with too much information\\n• When the time to make a decision is limited\\n• When the decision to be made is unimportant\\n• When there is access to very little information to use in making the decision\\n• When an appropriate heuristic happens to come to mind in the same moment\\nWorking backwards is a useful heuristic in which you begin solving the problem by focusing on the end\\nresult. Consider this example: You live in Washington, D.C. and have been invited to a wedding at 4 PM on\\nSaturday in Philadelphia. Knowing that Interstate 95 tends to back up any day of the week, you need to plan\\nyour route and time your departure accordingly. If you want to be at the wedding service by 3:30 PM, and it\\ntakes 2.5 hours to get to Philadelphia without traffic, what time should you leave your house? You use the\\nworking backwards heuristic to plan the events of your day on a regular basis, probably without even thinking\\nabout it.\\nAnother useful heuristic is the practice of accomplishing a large goal or task by breaking it into a series of\\nsmaller steps. Students often use this common method to complete a large research project or long essay for\\nschool. For example, students typically brainstorm, develop a thesis or main topic, research the chosen topic,\\norganize their information into an outline, write a rough draft, revise and edit the rough draft, develop a final\\ndraft, organize the references list, and proofread their work before turning in the project. The large task\\nbecomes less overwhelming when it is broken down into a series of small steps.\\nSolving Puzzles\\nProblem-solving abilities can improve with practice. Many people challenge themselves every day with puzzles\\nand other mental exercises to sharpen their problem-solving skills. Sudoku puzzles appear daily in most\\nnewspapers. Typically, a sudoku puzzle is a 9×9 grid. The simple sudoku below (Figure 7.7) is a 4×4 grid. To solve\\nthe puzzle, fill in the empty boxes with a single digit: 1, 2, 3, or 4. Here are the rules: The numbers must total 10\\nin each bolded box, each row, and each column; however, each digit can only appear once in a bolded box, row,\\nand column. Time yourself as you solve this puzzle and compare your time with a classmate.\\nEVERYDAY CONNECTION\\n7.3 • Problem Solving 223\\nFIGURE 7.7 How long did it take you to solve this sudoku puzzle? (You can see the answer at the end of this\\nsection.)\\nHere is another popular type of puzzle (Figure 7.8) that challenges your spatial reasoning skills. Connect all nine\\ndots with four connecting straight lines without lifting your pencil from the paper:\\nFIGURE 7.8 Did you figure it out? (The answer is at the end of this section.) Once you understand how to crack\\nthis puzzle, you won’t forget.\\nTake a look at the “Puzzling Scales” logic puzzle below (Figure 7.9). Sam Loyd, a well-known puzzle master,\\ncreated and refined countless puzzles throughout his lifetime (Cyclopedia of Puzzles, n.d.).\\n224 7 • Thinking and Intelligence\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nFIGURE 7.9 What steps did you take to solve this puzzle? You can read the solution at the end of this section.\\nPitfalls to Problem Solving\\nNot all problems are successfully solved, however. What challenges stop us from successfully solving a\\nproblem? Imagine a person in a room that has four doorways. One doorway that has always been open in the\\npast is now locked. The person, accustomed to exiting the room by that particular doorway, keeps trying to get\\nout through the same doorway even though the other three doorways are open. The person is stuck—but they\\njust need to go to another doorway, instead of trying to get out through the locked doorway. A mental set is\\nwhere you persist in approaching a problem in a way that has worked in the past but is clearly not working\\nnow.\\nFunctional fixedness is a type of mental set where you cannot perceive an object being used for something\\nother than what it was designed for. Duncker (1945) conducted foundational research on functional fixedness.\\nHe created an experiment in which participants were given a candle, a book of matches, and a box of\\nthumbtacks. They were instructed to use those items to attach the candle to the wall so that it did not drip wax\\nonto the table below. Participants had to use functional fixedness to overcome the problem (Figure 7.10).\\nDuring the Apollo 13 mission to the moon, NASA engineers at Mission Control had to overcome functional\\nfixedness to save the lives of the astronauts aboard the spacecraft. An explosion in a module of the spacecraft\\ndamaged multiple systems. The astronauts were in danger of being poisoned by rising levels of carbon dioxide\\nbecause of problems with the carbon dioxide filters. The engineers found a way for the astronauts to use spare\\nplastic bags, tape, and air hoses to create a makeshift air filter, which saved the lives of the astronauts.\\n7.3 • Problem Solving 225\\nintelligence are at the core of his conclusions.\\nIn a related story, parents of African American students filed a case against the State of California in 1979,\\nbecause they believed that the testing method used to identify students with learning disabilities was\\nculturally unfair as the tests were normed and standardized using White children (Larry P. v. Riles). The testing\\nmethod used by the state disproportionately identified African American children as “mentally retarded,\"\\nwhich resulted in many students being incorrectly classified. According to a summary of the case, Larry P. v.\\nRiles:\\nIn violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Education\\nfor All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, defendants have utilized standardized intelligence tests\\nthat are racially and culturally biased, have a discriminatory impact against Black children, and have\\nnot been validated for the purpose of essentially permanent placements of Black children into\\neducationally dead-end, isolated, and stigmatizing classes for the so-called educable mentally\\nretarded. Further, these federal laws have been violated by defendants\\' general use of placement\\nmechanisms that, taken together, have not been validated and result in a large over-representation of\\nBlack children in the special E.M.R. classes. (Larry P. v. Riles, par. 6)\\nOnce again, the limitations of intelligence testing were revealed.\\nWhat are Learning Disabilities?\\nLearning disabilities are cognitive disorders that affect different areas of cognition, particularly language or\\nreading. It should be pointed out that learning disabilities are not the same thing as intellectual disabilities.\\nLearning disabilities are considered specific neurological impairments rather than global intellectual or\\ndevelopmental disabilities. A person with a language disability has difficulty understanding or using spoken\\nlanguage, whereas someone with a reading disability, such as dyslexia, has difficulty processing what they are\\nreading.\\nOften, learning disabilities are not recognized until a child reaches school age. One confounding aspect of\\nlearning disabilities is that they most often affect children with average to above-average intelligence. In other\\nwords, the disability is specific to a particular area and not a measure of overall intellectual ability. At the same\\ntime, learning disabilities tend to exhibit comorbidity with other disorders, like attention-deficit hyperactivity\\ndisorder (ADHD). Anywhere between 30–70% of individuals with diagnosed cases of ADHD also have some sort\\nof learning disability (Riccio, Gonzales, & Hynd, 1994). Let’s take a look at three examples of common learning\\ndisabilities: dysgraphia, dyslexia, and dyscalculia.\\nDysgraphia\\nChildren with dysgraphia have a learning disability that results in a struggle to write legibly. The physical task\\nof writing with a pen and paper is extremely challenging for the person. These children often have extreme\\ndifficulty putting their thoughts down on paper (Smits-Engelsman & Van Galen, 1997). This difficulty is\\ninconsistent with a person’s IQ. That is, based on the child’s IQ and/or abilities in other areas, a child with\\ndysgraphia should be able to write, but can’t. Children with dysgraphia may also have problems with spatial\\nabilities.\\nStudents with dysgraphia need academic accommodations to help them succeed in school. These\\naccommodations can provide students with alternative assessment opportunities to demonstrate what they\\nknow (Barton, 2003). For example, a student with dysgraphia might be permitted to take an oral exam rather\\nthan a traditional paper-and-pencil test. Treatment is usually provided by an occupational therapist, although\\nthere is some question as to how effective such treatment is (Zwicker, 2005).\\nDyslexia\\nDyslexia is the most common learning disability in children. An individual with dyslexia exhibits an inability\\nto correctly process letters. The neurological mechanism for sound processing does not work properly in\\n7.6 • The Source of Intelligence 239\\nsomeone with dyslexia. As a result, dyslexic children may not understand sound-letter correspondence. A\\nchild with dyslexia may mix up letters within words and sentences—letter reversals, such as those shown in\\nFigure 7.17, are a hallmark of this learning disability—or skip whole words while reading. A dyslexic child may\\nhave difficulty spelling words correctly while writing. Because of the disordered way that the brain processes\\nletters and sound, learning to read is a frustrating experience. Some dyslexic individuals cope by memorizing\\nthe shapes of most words, but they never actually learn to read (Berninger, 2008).\\nFIGURE 7.17 These written words show variations of the word “teapot” as written by individuals with dyslexia.\\nDyscalculia\\nDyscalculia is difficulty in learning or comprehending arithmetic. This learning disability is often first evident\\nwhen children exhibit difficulty discerning how many objects are in a small group without counting them.\\nOther symptoms may include struggling to memorize math facts, organize numbers, or fully differentiate\\nbetween numerals, math symbols, and written numbers (such as “3” and “three”).\\n240 7 • Thinking and Intelligence\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nKey Terms\\nalgorithm problem-solving strategy characterized by a specific set of instructions\\nanalytical intelligence aligned with academic problem solving and computations\\nanchoring bias faulty heuristic in which you fixate on a single aspect of a problem to find a solution\\nartificial concept concept that is defined by a very specific set of characteristics\\navailability heuristic faulty heuristic in which you make a decision based on information readily available to\\nyou\\ncognition thinking, including perception, learning, problem solving, judgment, and memory\\ncognitive psychology field of psychology dedicated to studying every aspect of how people think\\ncognitive script set of behaviors that are performed the same way each time;

Concepts and their corresponding prototypes help us\\nquickly organize our thinking by creating categories into which we can sort new information. We also develop\\nschemata, which are clusters of related concepts. Some schemata involve routines of thought and behavior,\\nand these help us function properly in various situations without having to “think twice” about them.\\nSchemata show up in social situations and routines of daily behavior.\\n7.2 Language\\nLanguage is a communication system that has both a lexicon and a system of grammar. Language acquisition\\noccurs naturally and effortlessly during the early stages of life, and this acquisition occurs in a predictable\\nsequence for individuals around the world. Language has a strong influence on thought, and the concept of\\nhow language may influence cognition remains an area of study and debate in psychology.\\n7.3 Problem Solving\\nMany different strategies exist for solving problems. Typical strategies include trial and error, applying\\nalgorithms, and using heuristics. To solve a large, complicated problem, it often helps to break the problem\\ninto smaller steps that can be accomplished individually, leading to an overall solution. Roadblocks to problem\\nsolving include a mental set, functional fixedness, and various biases that can cloud decision making skills.\\n7.4 What Are Intelligence and Creativity?\\nIntelligence is a complex characteristic of cognition. Many theories have been developed to explain what\\nintelligence is and how it works. Sternberg generated his triarchic theory of intelligence, whereas Gardner\\nposits that intelligence is comprised of many factors. Still others focus on the importance of emotional\\nintelligence. Finally, creativity seems to be a facet of intelligence, but it is extremely difficult to measure\\nobjectively.\\n7.5 Measures of Intelligence\\nIn this section, we learned about the history of intelligence testing and some of the challenges regarding\\nintelligence testing. Intelligence tests began in earnest with Binet; Wechsler later developed intelligence tests\\nthat are still in use today: the WAIS-IV and WISC-V. The Bell curve shows the range of scores that encompass\\naverage intelligence as well as standard deviations.\\n242 7 • Summary\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\n7.6 The Source of Intelligence\\nGenetics and environment affect intelligence and the challenges of certain learning disabilities. The\\nintelligence levels of all individuals seem to benefit from rich stimulation in their early environments.

Learning disabilities can cause major challenges for children who are learning to read and\\nwrite. Unlike developmental disabilities, learning disabilities are strictly neurological in nature and are not\\nrelated to intelligence levels.

Context: LINK T O LEARNING Watch this video about how babies lose the ability to discriminate among all possible human phonemes as they age (http://openstax.org/l/language) to learn more. After the first few months of life, babies enter what is known as the babbling stage, during which time they tend to produce single syllables that are repeated over and over. As time passes, more variations appear in the syllables that they produce. During this time, it is unlikely that the babies are trying to communicate; they are just as likely to babble when they are alone as when they are with their caregivers (Fernández & Cairns, 2011). Interestingly, babies who are raised in environments in which sign language is used will also begin to show babbling in the gestures of their hands during this stage (Petitto, Holowka, Sergio, Levy, & Ostry, 2004). Generally, a child’s first word is uttered sometime between the ages of 1 year to 18 months, and for the next few months, the child will remain in the “one word” stage of language development. During this time, children know a number of words, but they only produce one-word utterances. The child’s early vocabulary is limited to familiar objects or events, often nouns. Although children in this stage only make one-word utterances, these words often carry larger meaning (Fernández & Cairns, 2011). So, for example, a child saying “cookie” could be identifying a cookie or asking for a cookie. As a child’s lexicon grows, they begin to utter simple sentences and to acquire new vocabulary at a very rapid pace. In addition, children begin to demonstrate a clear understanding of the specific rules that apply to their language(s). Even the mistakes that children sometimes make provide evidence of just how much they understand about those rules. This is sometimes seen in the form of overgeneralization. In this context, overgeneralization refers to an extension of a language rule to an exception to the rule. For example, in English, it is usually the case that an “s” is added to the end of a word to indicate plurality. However, if a child is given the word “apple” and is asked to say “apples,” he or she will probably respond with “pears” or “peach” instead of “aples.” In fact, this is a common mistake that many children make. It is important to note, however, that this type of error is not necessarily a sign of lack of understanding. Rather, what it indicates is that the children have not yet learned the rules governing the use of plural and singular forms. In addition to learning new words and using new forms of speech, young children are also learning how to use their spoken language in a variety of contexts. They are learning to respond to questions, to answer questions, and to express their own thoughts and feelings. These are all important skills that will serve them well throughout their lives. Children who have a strong grasp of these skills will be better able to understand and communicate with others, as well as be more successful in school and in their personal relationships with other people. At the age of three or four years of age, most children will have mastered the basic rules of grammar and will be ready to begin speaking in sentences. By the time children reach the fourth grade, many of them have learned to speak in complete sentences that include a subject and a predicate. At this point, their vocabulary will have grown to a point where they can use a wide range of adjectives and adverbs to describe the things they see, hear, or experience. Most importantly, however, at this age they have begun to develop an understanding of how language works and how it can be used to convey meaning and express ideas.

      "Response for query ID 6: {'context': 'between 73 and 79 years old (Singh & Siahpush, 2006), we can expect to spend approximately 25 years of our\\nlives sleeping. Some animals never sleep (e.g., some fish and amphibian species); other animals sleep very\\nlittle without apparent negative consequences (e.g., giraffes); yet some animals (e.g., rats) die after two weeks\\nof sleep deprivation (Siegel, 2008). Why do we devote so much time to sleeping? Is it absolutely essential that\\nwe sleep? This section will consider these questions and explore various explanations for why we sleep.\\nWhat is Sleep?\\nYou have read that sleep is distinguished by low levels of physical activity and reduced sensory awareness. As\\ndiscussed by Siegel (2008), a definition of sleep must also include mention of the interplay of the circadian and\\nhomeostatic mechanisms that regulate sleep. Homeostatic regulation of sleep is evidenced by sleep rebound\\nfollowing sleep deprivation. Sleep rebound refers to the fact that a sleep-deprived individual will fall asleep\\nmore quickly during subsequent opportunities for sleep. Sleep is characterized by certain patterns of activity\\nof the brain that can be visualized using electroencephalography (EEG), and different phases of sleep can be\\ndifferentiated using EEG as well.\\nSleep-wake cycles seem to be controlled by multiple brain areas acting in conjunction with one another. Some\\nof these areas include the thalamus, the hypothalamus, and the pons. As already mentioned, the\\nhypothalamus contains the SCN—the biological clock of the body—in addition to other nuclei that, in\\nconjunction with the thalamus, regulate slow-wave sleep. The pons is important for regulating rapid eye\\nmovement (REM) sleep (National Institutes of Health, n.d.).\\nSleep is also associated with the secretion and regulation of a number of hormones from several endocrine\\nglands including: melatonin, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and growth\\nhormone (National Institutes of Health, n.d.). You have read that the pineal gland releases melatonin during\\nsleep (Figure 4.6). Melatonin is thought to be involved in the regulation of various biological rhythms and the\\nimmune system (Hardeland et al., 2006). During sleep, the pituitary gland secretes both FSH and LH which are\\nimportant in regulating the reproductive system (Christensen et al., 2012; Sofikitis et al., 2008). The pituitary\\ngland also secretes growth hormone, during sleep, which plays a role in physical growth and maturation as\\nwell as other metabolic processes (Bartke, Sun, & Longo, 2013).\\nFIGURE 4.6 The pineal and pituitary glands secrete a number of hormones during sleep.\\nWhy Do We Sleep?\\nGiven the central role that sleep plays in our lives and the number of adverse consequences that have been\\nassociated with sleep deprivation, one would think that we would have a clear understanding of why it is that\\nwe sleep. Unfortunately, this is not the case; however, several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the\\nfunction of sleep.\\n4.2 • Sleep and Why We Sleep 115\\nAdaptive Function of Sleep\\nOne popular hypothesis of sleep incorporates the perspective of evolutionary psychology. Evolutionary\\npsychology is a discipline that studies how universal patterns of behavior and cognitive processes have\\nevolved over time as a result of natural selection. Variations and adaptations in cognition and behavior make\\nindividuals more or less successful in reproducing and passing their genes to their offspring. One hypothesis\\nfrom this perspective might argue that sleep is essential to restore resources that are expended during the day.\\nJust as bears hibernate in the winter when resources are scarce, perhaps people sleep at night to reduce their\\nenergy expenditures. While this is an intuitive explanation of sleep, there is little research that supports this\\nexplanation. In fact, it has been suggested that there is no reason to think that energetic demands could not be\\naddressed with periods of rest and inactivity (Frank, 2006; Rial et al., 2007), and some research has actually\\nfound a negative correlation between energetic demands and the amount of time spent sleeping (Capellini,\\nBarton, McNamara, Preston, & Nunn, 2008).\\nAnother evolutionary hypothesis of sleep holds that our sleep patterns evolved as an adaptive response to\\npredatory risks, which increase in darkness. Thus we sleep in safe areas to reduce the chance of harm. Again,\\nthis is an intuitive and appealing explanation for why we sleep. Perhaps our ancestors spent extended periods\\nof time asleep to reduce attention to themselves from potential predators. Comparative research indicates,\\nhowever, that the relationship that exists between predatory risk and sleep is very complex and equivocal.\\nSome research suggests that species that face higher predatory risks sleep fewer hours than other species\\n(Capellini et al., 2008), while other researchers suggest there is no relationship between the amount of time a\\ngiven species spends in deep sleep and its predation risk (Lesku, Roth, Amlaner, & Lima, 2006).\\nIt is quite possible that sleep serves no single universally adaptive function, and different species have evolved\\ndifferent patterns of sleep in response to their unique evolutionary pressures. While we have discussed the\\nnegative outcomes associated with sleep deprivation, it should be pointed out that there are many benefits that\\nare associated with adequate amounts of sleep. A few such benefits listed by the National Sleep Foundation\\n(n.d.) include maintaining healthy weight, lowering stress levels, improving mood, and increasing motor\\ncoordination, as well as a number of benefits related to cognition and memory formation.\\nCognitive Function of Sleep\\nAnother theory regarding why we sleep involves sleep’s importance for cognitive function and memory\\nformation (Rattenborg, Lesku, Martinez-Gonzalez, & Lima, 2007). Indeed, we know sleep deprivation results in\\ndisruptions in cognition and memory deficits (Brown, 2012), leading to impairments in our abilities to\\nmaintain attention, make decisions, and recall long-term memories. Moreover, these impairments become\\nmore severe as the amount of sleep deprivation increases (Alhola & Polo-Kantola, 2007). Furthermore, slow-\\nwave sleep after learning a new task can improve resultant performance on that task (Huber, Ghilardi,\\nMassimini, & Tononi, 2004) and seems essential for effective memory formation (Stickgold, 2005).\\nUnderstanding the impact of sleep on cognitive function should help you understand that cramming all night\\nfor a test may be not effective and can even prove counterproductive.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nWatch this brief video that gives sleep tips for college students (http://openstax.org/l/sleeptips) to learn more.\\nGetting the optimal amount of sleep has also been associated with other cognitive benefits. Research indicates\\nthat included among these possible benefits are increased capacities for creative thinking (Cai, Mednick,\\nHarrison, Kanady, & Mednick, 2009; Wagner, Gais, Haider, Verleger, & Born, 2004), language learning (Fenn,\\nNusbaum, & Margoliash, 2003; Gómez, Bootzin, & Nadel, 2006), and inferential judgments (Ellenbogen, Hu,\\nPayne, Titone, & Walker, 2007). It is possible that even the processing of emotional information is influenced by\\ncertain aspects of sleep (Walker, 2009).\\n116 4 • States of Consciousness\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nWatch this brief video about the relationship between sleep and memory (http://openstax.org/l/sleepmemory)\\nto learn more.\\n4.3 Stages of Sleep\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Differentiate between REM and non-REM sleep\\n• Describe the differences between the three stages of non-REM sleep\\n• Understand the role that REM and non-REM sleep play in learning and memory\\nSleep is not a uniform state of being. Instead, sleep is composed of several different stages that can be\\ndifferentiated from one another by the patterns of brain wave activity that occur during each stage. While\\nawake, our brain wave activity is dominated by beta waves. As compared to the brain wave patterns while\\nasleep, beta waves have the highest frequency (13–30 Hz) and lowest amplitude, and they tend to show more\\nvariability. As we begin to fall asleep, our brain wave activity changes. These changes can be visualized using\\nan EEG and are distinguished from one another by both the frequency and amplitude of the brain wave. The\\nfrequency of a brain wave is how many brain waves occur in a second, and frequency is measured in Hertz\\n(Hz). Amplitude is the height of the brain wave (Figure 4.7). Sleep can be divided into two different general\\nphases: REM sleep and non-REM (NREM) sleep. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is characterized by darting\\nmovements of the eyes under closed eyelids. Brain waves during REM sleep appear very similar to brain waves\\nduring wakefulness. In contrast, non-REM (NREM) sleep is subdivided into three stages distinguished from\\neach other and from wakefulness by characteristic patterns of brain waves. The first three stages of sleep are\\nNREM sleep, typically followed by REM sleep. In this section, we will discuss each of these stages of sleep and\\ntheir associated patterns of brain wave activity.\\nFIGURE 4.7 Brainwave activity changes dramatically across the different stages of sleep. (credit \"sleeping\":\\nmodification of work by Ryan Vaarsi)\\nNREM Stages of Sleep\\nAs we begin to fall asleep, we enter NREM sleep, and brain wave patterns decrease in frequency and increase\\nin amplitude. The first stage of NREM sleep is known as stage 1 sleep. Stage 1 sleep is a transitional phase that\\noccurs between wakefulness and sleep, the period during which we drift off to sleep. During this time, there is\\na slowdown in both the rates of respiration and heartbeat. In addition, stage 1 sleep involves a marked\\n4.3 • Stages of Sleep 117\\ndecrease in both overall muscle tension and core body temperature.\\nIn terms of brain wave activity, stage 1 sleep is associated with both alpha and theta waves. The early portion of\\nstage 1 sleep produces alpha waves. These patterns of electrical activity (waves) resemble that of someone\\nwho is very relaxed, yet awake, but they have less variability (are more synchronized) and are relatively lower\\nin frequency (8–12 Hz) and higher in amplitude than beta waves (Figure 4.8). As an individual continues\\nthrough stage 1 sleep, there is an increase in theta wave activity. Theta waves are even lower frequency (4–7\\nHz), and higher in amplitude, than the alpha wave patterns. It is relatively easy to wake someone from stage 1\\nsleep; in fact, people often report that they have not been asleep if they are awoken during stage 1 sleep.\\nFIGURE 4.8 Brainwave activity changes dramatically across the different stages of sleep.\\nAs we move into stage 2 sleep, the body goes into a state of deep relaxation. Theta waves still dominate the\\nactivity of the brain, but they are interrupted by brief bursts of activity known as sleep spindles (Figure 4.9). A\\nsleep spindle is a rapid burst of higher frequency brain waves that may be important for learning and memory\\n(Fogel & Smith, 2011; Poe, Walsh, & Bjorness, 2010). In addition, the appearance of K-complexes is often\\nassociated with stage 2 sleep. A K-complex is a very high amplitude pattern of brain activity that may in some\\ncases occur in response to environmental stimuli. Thus, K-complexes might serve as a bridge to higher levels\\nof arousal in response to what is going on in our environments (Halász, 1993; Steriade & Amzica, 1998).\\nFIGURE 4.9 Stage 2 sleep is characterized by the appearance of both sleep spindles and K-complexes.\\nNREM stage 3 sleep is often referred to as deep sleep or slow-wave sleep because this stage is characterized by\\nlow frequency (less than 3 Hz), high amplitude delta waves (Figure 4.10). These delta waves have the lowest\\nfrequency and highest amplitude of our sleeping brain wave patterns. During this time, an individual’s heart\\nrate and respiration slow dramatically, and it is much more difficult to awaken someone from sleep during\\n118 4 • States of Consciousness\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nstage 3 than during earlier stages. Interestingly, individuals who have increased levels of alpha brain wave\\nactivity (more often associated with wakefulness and transition into stage 1 sleep) during stage 3 often report\\nthat they do not feel refreshed upon waking, regardless of how long they slept (Stone, Taylor, McCrae, Kalsekar,\\n& Lichstein, 2008).\\nFIGURE 4.10 (a) Delta waves, which are low frequency and high amplitude, characterize (b) slow-wave stage 3 and\\nREM sleep.\\nREM Sleep\\nAs mentioned earlier, REM sleep is marked by rapid movements of the eyes. The brain waves associated with\\nthis stage of sleep are very similar to those observed when a person is awake, as shown in Figure 4.11, and this\\nis the period of sleep in which dreaming occurs. It is also associated with paralysis of muscle systems in the\\nbody with the exception of those that make circulation and respiration possible. Therefore, no movement of\\nvoluntary muscles occurs during REM sleep in a normal individual; REM sleep is often referred to as\\nparadoxical sleep because of this combination of high brain activity and lack of muscle tone. Like NREM sleep,\\nREM has been implicated in various aspects of learning and memory (Wagner, Gais, & Born, 2001; Siegel,\\n2001).\\nFIGURE 4.11 (a) A period of rapid eye movement is marked by the short red line segment. The brain waves\\nassociated with REM sleep, outlined in the red box in (a), look very similar to those seen (b) during wakefulness.\\nIf people are deprived of REM sleep and then allowed to sleep without disturbance, they will spend more time\\nin REM sleep in what would appear to be an effort to recoup the lost time in REM. This is known as the REM\\nrebound, and it suggests that REM sleep is also homeostatically regulated. Aside from the role that REM sleep\\nmay play in processes related to learning and memory, REM sleep may also be involved in emotional\\n4.3 • Stages of Sleep 119\\n23.

Maybe it would be best just go back to bed. A bed . . . what is a bed?\\nWe have an amazing capacity for memory, but how, exactly, do we process and store information? Are there\\ndifferent kinds of memory, and if so, what characterizes the different types? How, exactly, do we retrieve our\\nmemories? And why do we forget? This chapter will explore these questions as we learn about memory.\\n8Memory\\n8.1 How Memory Functions\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Discuss the three basic functions of memory\\n• Describe the three stages of memory storage\\n• Describe and distinguish between procedural and declarative memory and semantic and episodic memory\\nMemory is an information processing system; therefore, we often compare it to a computer. Memory is the set\\nof processes used to encode, store, and retrieve information over different periods of time (Figure 8.2).\\nFIGURE 8.2 Encoding involves the input of information into the memory system. Storage is the retention of the\\nencoded information. Retrieval, or getting the information out of memory and back into awareness, is the third\\nfunction.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nWatch this video about the neuroscience of memory (http://openstax.org/l/unexpectfact) to learn more.\\nEncoding\\nWe get information into our brains through a process called encoding, which is the input of information into\\nthe memory system. Once we receive sensory information from the environment, our brains label or code it.\\nWe organize the information with other similar information and connect new concepts to existing concepts.\\nEncoding information occurs through automatic processing and effortful processing.\\nIf someone asks you what you ate for lunch today, more than likely you could recall this information quite\\neasily. This is known as automatic processing, or the encoding of details like time, space, frequency, and the\\nmeaning of words. Automatic processing is usually done without any conscious awareness. Recalling the last\\ntime you studied for a test is another example of automatic processing. But what about the actual test material\\nyou studied? It probably required a lot of work and attention on your part in order to encode that information.\\nThis is known as effortful processing (Figure 8.3).\\nFIGURE 8.3 When you first learn new skills such as driving a car, you have to put forth effort and attention to\\nencode information about how to start a car, how to brake, how to handle a turn, and so on. Once you know how to\\ndrive, you can encode additional information about this skill automatically. (credit: Robert Couse-Baker)\\nWhat are the most effective ways to ensure that important memories are well encoded? Even a simple\\nsentence is easier to recall when it is meaningful (Anderson, 1984). Read the following sentences (Bransford &\\n248 8 • Memory\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nMcCarrell, 1974), then look away and count backwards from 30 by threes to zero, and then try to write down\\nthe sentences (no peeking back at this page!).\\n1. The notes were sour because the seams split.\\n2. The voyage wasn\\'t delayed because the bottle shattered.\\n3. The haystack was important because the cloth ripped.\\nHow well did you do? By themselves, the statements that you wrote down were most likely confusing and\\ndifficult for you to recall. Now, try writing them again, using the following prompts: bagpipe, ship christening,\\nand parachutist. Next count backwards from 40 by fours, then check yourself to see how well you recalled the\\nsentences this time. You can see that the sentences are now much more memorable because each of the\\nsentences was placed in context. Material is far better encoded when you make it meaningful.\\nThere are three types of encoding. The encoding of words and their meaning is known as semantic encoding.\\nIt was first demonstrated by William Bousfield (1935) in an experiment in which he asked people to memorize\\nwords. The 60 words were actually divided into 4 categories of meaning, although the participants did not\\nknow this because the words were randomly presented. When they were asked to remember the words, they\\ntended to recall them in categories, showing that they paid attention to the meanings of the words as they\\nlearned them.\\nVisual encoding is the encoding of images, and acoustic encoding is the encoding of sounds, words in\\nparticular. To see how visual encoding works, read over this list of words: car, level, dog, truth, book, value. If\\nyou were asked later to recall the words from this list, which ones do you think you’d most likely remember?\\nYou would probably have an easier time recalling the words car, dog, and book, and a more difficult time\\nrecalling the words level, truth, and value. Why is this? Because you can recall images (mental pictures) more\\neasily than words alone. When you read the words car, dog, and book you created images of these things in\\nyour mind. These are concrete, high-imagery words. On the other hand, abstract words like level, truth, and\\nvalue are low-imagery words. High-imagery words are encoded both visually and semantically (Paivio, 1986),\\nthus building a stronger memory.\\nNow let’s turn our attention to acoustic encoding. You are driving in your car and a song comes on the radio\\nthat you haven’t heard in at least 10 years, but you sing along, recalling every word. In the United States,\\nchildren often learn the alphabet through song, and they learn the number of days in each month through\\nrhyme: “Thirty days hath September, / April, June, and November; / All the rest have thirty-one, / Save\\nFebruary, with twenty-eight days clear, / And twenty-nine each leap year.” These lessons are easy to remember\\nbecause of acoustic encoding. We encode the sounds the words make. This is one of the reasons why much of\\nwhat we teach young children is done through song, rhyme, and rhythm.\\nWhich of the three types of encoding do you think would give you the best memory of verbal information?\\nSome years ago, psychologists Fergus Craik and Endel Tulving (1975) conducted a series of experiments to\\nfind out. Participants were given words along with questions about them. The questions required the\\nparticipants to process the words at one of the three levels. The visual processing questions included such\\nthings as asking the participants about the font of the letters. The acoustic processing questions asked the\\nparticipants about the sound or rhyming of the words, and the semantic processing questions asked the\\nparticipants about the meaning of the words. After participants were presented with the words and questions,\\nthey were given an unexpected recall or recognition task.\\nWords that had been encoded semantically were better remembered than those encoded visually or\\nacoustically. Semantic encoding involves a deeper level of processing than the shallower visual or acoustic\\nencoding. Craik and Tulving concluded that we process verbal information best through semantic encoding,\\nespecially if we apply what is called the self-reference effect. The self-reference effect is the tendency for an\\nindividual to have better memory for information that relates to oneself in comparison to material that has less\\npersonal relevance (Rogers, Kuiper, & Kirker, 1977). Could semantic encoding be beneficial to you as you\\n8.1 • How Memory Functions 249\\nattempt to memorize the concepts in this chapter?\\nStorage\\nOnce the information has been encoded, we have to somehow retain it. Our brains take the encoded\\ninformation and place it in storage. Storage is the creation of a permanent record of information.\\nIn order for a memory to go into storage (i.e., long-term memory), it has to pass through three distinct stages:\\nSensory Memory, Short-Term Memory, and finally Long-Term Memory. These stages were first proposed by\\nRichard Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin (1968). Their model of human memory (Figure 8.4), called Atkinson\\nand Shiffrin\\'s model, is based on the belief that we process memories in the same way that a computer\\nprocesses information.\\nFIGURE 8.4 According to the Atkinson-Shiffrin model of memory, information passes through three distinct stages\\nin order for it to be stored in long-term memory.\\nAtkinson and Shiffrin\\'s model is not the only model of memory. Baddeley and Hitch (1974) proposed a working\\nmemory model in which short-term memory has different forms. In their model, storing memories in short-\\nterm memory is like opening different files on a computer and adding information. The working memory files\\nhold a limited amount of information. The type of short-term memory (or computer file) depends on the type\\nof information received. There are memories in visual-spatial form, as well as memories of spoken or written\\nmaterial, and they are stored in three short-term systems: a visuospatial sketchpad, an episodic buffer\\n(Baddeley, 2000), and a phonological loop. According to Baddeley and Hitch, a central executive part of\\nmemory supervises or controls the flow of information to and from the three short-term systems, and the\\ncentral executive is responsible for moving information into long-term memory.\\nSensory Memory\\nIn the Atkinson-Shiffrin model, stimuli from the environment are processed first in sensory memory: storage\\nof brief sensory events, such as sights, sounds, and tastes. It is very brief storage—up to a couple of seconds. We\\nare constantly bombarded with sensory information. We cannot absorb all of it, or even most of it. And most of\\nit has no impact on our lives. For example, what was your professor wearing the last class period? As long as\\nthe professor was dressed appropriately, it does not really matter what she was wearing. Sensory information\\nabout sights, sounds, smells, and even textures, which we do not view as valuable information, we discard. If\\nwe view something as valuable, the information will move into our short-term memory system.\\nShort-Term Memory\\nShort-term memory (STM) is a temporary storage system that processes incoming sensory memory. The\\nterms short-term and working memory are sometimes used interchangeably, but they are not exactly the\\nsame. Short-term memory is more accurately described as a component of working memory. Short-term\\nmemory takes information from sensory memory and sometimes connects that memory to something already\\n250 8 • Memory\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nin long-term memory. Short-term memory storage lasts 15 to 30 seconds. Think of it as the information you\\nhave displayed on your computer screen, such as a document, spreadsheet, or website. Then, information in\\nSTM goes to long-term memory (you save it to your hard drive), or it is discarded (you delete a document or\\nclose a web browser).\\nRehearsal moves information from short-term memory to long-term memory. Active rehearsal is a way of\\nattending to information to move it from short-term to long-term memory. During active rehearsal, you repeat\\n(practice) the information to be remembered. If you repeat it enough, it may be moved into long-term memory.\\nFor example, this type of active rehearsal is the way many children learn their ABCs by singing the alphabet\\nsong. Alternatively, elaborative rehearsal is the act of linking new information you are trying to learn to\\nexisting information that you already know. For example, if you meet someone at a party and your phone is\\ndead but you want to remember his phone number, which starts with area code 203, you might remember that\\nyour uncle Abdul lives in Connecticut and has a 203 area code. This way, when you try to remember the phone\\nnumber of your new prospective friend, you will easily remember the area code. Craik and Lockhart (1972)\\nproposed the levels of processing hypothesis that states the deeper you think about something, the better you\\nremember it.\\nYou may find yourself asking, “How much information can our memory handle at once?” To explore the\\ncapacity and duration of your short-term memory, have a partner read the strings of random numbers (Figure\\n8.5) out loud to you, beginning each string by saying, “Ready?” and ending each by saying, “Recall,” at which\\npoint you should try to write down the string of numbers from memory.\\nFIGURE 8.5 Work through this series of numbers using the recall exercise explained above to determine the longest\\nstring of digits that you can store.\\nNote the longest string at which you got the series correct. For most people, the capacity will probably be close\\nto 7 plus or minus 2. In 1956, George Miller reviewed most of the research on the capacity of short-term\\nmemory and found that people can retain between 5 and 9 items, so he reported the capacity of short-term\\nmemory was the \"magic number\" 7 plus or minus 2. However, more contemporary research has found\\nworking memory capacity is 4 plus or minus 1 (Cowan, 2010). Generally, recall is somewhat better for random\\nnumbers than for random letters (Jacobs, 1887) and also often slightly better for information we hear (acoustic\\nencoding) rather than information we see (visual encoding) (Anderson, 1969).\\nMemory trace decay and interference are two factors that affect short-term memory retention. Peterson and\\nPeterson (1959) investigated short-term memory using the three letter sequences called trigrams (e.g., CLS)\\nthat had to be recalled after various time intervals between 3 and 18 seconds. Participants remembered about\\n80% of the trigrams after a 3-second delay, but only 10% after a delay of 18 seconds, which caused them to\\nconclude that short-term memory decayed in 18 seconds. During decay, the memory trace becomes less\\nactivated over time, and the information is forgotten. However, Keppel and Underwood (1962) examined only\\nthe first trials of the trigram task and found that proactive interference also affected short-term memory\\nretention. During proactive interference, previously learned information interferes with the ability to learn\\nnew information. Both memory trace decay and proactive interference affect short-term memory. Once the\\ninformation reaches long-term memory, it has to be consolidated at both the synaptic level, which takes a few\\nhours, and into the memory system, which can take weeks or longer.\\nLong-term Memory\\nLong-term memory (LTM) is the continuous storage of information. Unlike short-term memory, long-term\\nmemory storage capacity is believed to be unlimited. It encompasses all the things you can remember that\\nhappened more than just a few minutes ago. One cannot really consider long-term memory without thinking\\nabout the way it is organized. Really quickly, what is the first word that comes to mind when you hear “peanut\\n8.1 • How Memory Functions 251\\nbutter”? Did you think of jelly? If you did, you probably have associated peanut butter and jelly in your mind. It\\nis generally accepted that memories are organized in semantic (or associative) networks (Collins & Loftus,\\n1975). A semantic network consists of concepts, and as you may recall from what you’ve learned about\\nmemory, concepts are categories or groupings of linguistic information, images, ideas, or memories, such as\\nlife experiences. Although individual experiences and expertise can affect concept arrangement, concepts are\\nbelieved to be arranged hierarchically in the mind (Anderson & Reder, 1999; Johnson & Mervis, 1997, 1998;\\nPalmer, Jones, Hennessy, Unze, & Pick, 1989; Rosch, Mervis, Gray, Johnson, & Boyes-Braem, 1976; Tanaka &\\nTaylor, 1991). Related concepts are linked, and the strength of the link depends on how often two concepts\\nhave been associated.\\nSemantic networks differ depending on personal experiences. Importantly for memory, activating any part of a\\nsemantic network also activates the concepts linked to that part to a lesser degree. The process is known as\\nspreading activation (Collins & Loftus, 1975). If one part of a network is activated, it is easier to access the\\nassociated concepts because they are already partially activated. When you remember or recall something,\\nyou activate a concept, and the related concepts are more easily remembered because they are partially\\nactivated. However, the activations do not spread in just one direction. When you remember something, you\\nusually have several routes to get the information you are trying to access, and the more links you have to a\\nconcept, the better your chances of remembering.\\nThere are two types of long-term memory: explicit and implicit (Figure 8.6). Understanding the difference\\nbetween explicit memory and implicit memory is important because aging, particular types of brain trauma,\\nand certain disorders can impact explicit and implicit memory in different ways. Explicit memories are those\\nwe consciously try to remember, recall, and report. For example, if you are studying for your chemistry exam,\\nthe material you are learning will be part of your explicit memory. In keeping with the computer analogy, some\\ninformation in your long-term memory would be like the information you have saved on the hard drive. It is\\nnot there on your desktop (your short-term memory), but most of the time you can pull up this information\\nwhen you want it. Not all long-term memories are strong memories, and some memories can only be recalled\\nusing prompts. For example, you might easily recall a fact, such as the capital of the United States, but you\\nmight struggle to recall the name of the restaurant at which you had dinner when you visited a nearby city last\\nsummer. A prompt, such as that the restaurant was named after its owner, might help you recall the name of\\nthe restaurant. Explicit memory is sometimes referred to as declarative memory, because it can be put into\\nwords. Explicit memory is divided into episodic memory and semantic memory.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nView this video that explains short-term and long-term memory (http://openstax.org/l/HMbrain) to learn more\\nabout how memories are stored and retrieved.\\nEpisodic memory is information about events we have personally experienced (i.e., an episode). For instance,\\nthe memory of your last birthday is an episodic memory. Usually, episodic memory is reported as a story. The\\nconcept of episodic memory was first proposed about in the 1970s (Tulving, 1972). Since then, Tulving and\\nothers have reformulated the theory, and currently scientists believe that episodic memory is memory about\\nhappenings in particular places at particular times—the what, where, and when of an event (Tulving, 2002). It\\ninvolves recollection of visual imagery as well as the feeling of familiarity (Hassabis & Maguire, 2007).\\nSemantic memory is knowledge about words, concepts, and language-based knowledge and facts. Semantic\\nmemory is typically reported as facts. Semantic means having to do with language and knowledge about\\nlanguage. For example, answers to the following questions like “what is the definition of psychology” and “who\\nwas the first African American president of the United States” are stored in your semantic memory.\\nImplicit memories are long-term memories that are not part of our consciousness. Although implicit\\nmemories are learned outside of our awareness and cannot be consciously recalled, implicit memory is\\ndemonstrated in the performance of some task (Roediger, 1990; Schacter, 1987).

Plain text, no Markdown. Answer only, no other questions. Context: between 73 and 79 years old (Singh & Siahpush, 2006), we can expect to spend approximately 25 years of our lives sleeping. Some animals never sleep (e.g., some fish and amphibian species); other animals sleep very little without apparent negative consequences (e.g., giraffes); yet some animals (e.g., rats) die after two weeks of sleep deprivation (Siegel, 2008). Why do we devote so much time to sleeping? Is it absolutely essential that we sleep? This section will consider these questions and explore various explanations for why we sleep. What is Sleep? You have read that sleep is distinguished by low levels of physical activity and reduced sensory awareness. As discussed by Siegel (2008), a definition of sleep must also include mention of the interplay of the circadian and homeostatic mechanisms that regulate sleep. Homeostatic regulation of sleep is evidenced by sleep rebound following sleep deprivation. Sleep rebound refers to the fact that a sleep-deprived individual will fall asleep more quickly during subsequent opportunities for sleep. Sleep is characterized by certain patterns of activity of the brain that can be visualized using electroencephalography (EEG), and different phases of sleep can be differentiated using EEG as well. Sleep-wake cycles seem to be controlled by multiple brain areas acting in conjunction with one another. Some of these areas include the thalamus, the hypothalamus, and the pons. As already mentioned, the hypothalamus contains the SCN—the biological clock of the body—in addition to other nuclei that, in conjunction with the thalamus, regulate slow-wave sleep. The pons is important for regulating rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (National Institutes of Health, n.d.). Sleep is also associated with the secretion and regulation of a number of hormones from several endocrine glands including: melatonin, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and growth hormone (National Institutes of Health, n.d.). You have read that the pineal gland releases melatonin during sleep (Figure 4.6). Melatonin is thought to be involved in regulating the sleep/wake cycle. In addition, melatonin also plays an important role in maintaining the homeostasis of body temperature, blood pressure, and blood glucose levels. It has also been shown to have a positive effect on the immune system, which is important in the fight against viral infections. The sleep cycle is divided into four stages: NREM (non-rapid eye movement) and REM (rapid-eye-movement) sleep. During the first stage (NREM sleep), the heart rate and breathing rate slow down. This is followed by a period of light sleep, during which the eyes move rapidly from side to side and there is no sense of time. During the second stage, known as the deep sleep phase, brain waves become slower and more regular. At this point, a person may feel drowsy, but is still able to respond to external stimuli. Finally, at the third stage, known as REM sleep or wakefulness, there are rapid changes in brain wave activity, including increased brain waves and increased muscle activity. REM is the stage in which dreaming occurs. After the fourth stage (NREM stage 3) is reached, sleep begins to wane and consciousness returns to normal. There are many factors that influence the duration and quality of each sleep stage. These factors include age, sex, body mass index (BMI), sleep environment (temperature, lighting, etc.), and environmental stimuli (such as noise, light, music, or television). Sleep deprivation can also be caused by a variety of explanations. For example, some people may have difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep due to psychological factors such as anxiety or depression. Others may suffer from sleep apnea or other sleep disorders that prevent them from getting a full night's rest. There are also many medical conditions that can cause sleep disturbances. A few examples of these conditions include narcolepsy, restless legs syndrome, parasomnias (including sleepwalking and night terrors), hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid gland), polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBD). These conditions can affect the quality and duration of one's sleep and can lead to daytime sleepiness, fatigue, irritability, mood disturbances, or other negative effects on daily functioning.

We have tended to classify an\\nindividual as either male or female according to the sex they were assigned at birth, leading the United States\\nto be considered a cisnormative society. However, in some cultures there are additional gender variants\\nresulting in more than two gender categories. For example, in Thailand, you can be male, female, or kathoey. A\\nkathoey is an individual who would be described as intersex or transgender in the United States\\n(Tangmunkongvorakul, Banwell, Carmichael, Utomo, & Sleigh, 2010).\\nThe Case of David Reimer\\nIn August of 1965, Janet and Ronald Reimer of Winnipeg, Canada, welcomed the birth of their twin sons, Bruce\\nand Brian. Within a few months, the twins were experiencing urinary problems; doctors recommended the\\nproblems could be alleviated by having the boys circumcised. A malfunction of the medical equipment used to\\nperform the circumcision resulted in Bruce’s penis being irreparably damaged. Distraught, Janet and Ronald\\nlooked to expert advice on what to do with their baby boy. By happenstance, the couple became aware of Dr.\\nJohn Money at Johns Hopkins University and his theory of psychosexual neutrality (Colapinto, 2000).\\nDr. Money had spent a considerable amount of time researching transgender individuals and individuals born\\nwith ambiguous genitalia. As a result of this work, he developed a theory of psychosexual neutrality. His theory\\nasserted that we are essentially neutral at birth with regard to our gender identity and that we don’t assume a\\nconcrete gender identity until we begin to master language. Furthermore, Dr. Money believed that the way in\\nwhich we are socialized in early life is ultimately much more important than our biology in determining our\\ngender identity (Money, 1962).\\nDr. Money encouraged Janet and Ronald to bring the twins to Johns Hopkins University, and he convinced them\\nthat they should raise Bruce as a girl. Left with few other options at the time, Janet and Ronald agreed to have\\nBruce’s testicles removed and to raise him as a girl. When they returned home to Canada, they brought with them\\nBrian and his “sister,” Brenda, along with specific instructions to never reveal to Brenda that she had been born a\\nboy (Colapinto, 2000).\\nEarly on, Dr. Money shared with the scientific community the great success of this natural experiment that\\nseemed to fully support his theory of psychosexual neutrality (Money, 1975). Indeed, in early interviews with the\\nchildren it appeared that Brenda was a typical little girl who liked to play with “girly” toys and do “girly” things.\\nHowever, Dr. Money was less than forthcoming with information that seemed to argue against the success of the\\ncase. In reality, Brenda’s parents were constantly concerned that their little girl wasn’t really behaving as most\\ngirls did, and by the time Brenda was nearing adolescence, it was painfully obvious to the family that she was\\nreally having a hard time identifying as a female. In addition, Brenda was becoming increasingly reluctant to\\ncontinue her visits with Dr. Money to the point that she threatened suicide if her parents made her go back to see\\nhim again.\\nAt that point, Janet and Ronald disclosed the true nature of Brenda’s early childhood to their daughter. While\\ninitially shocked, Brenda reported that things made sense to her now, and ultimately, by the time she was an\\nadolescent, Brenda had decided to identify as a male. Thus, she became David Reimer.\\nDavid was quite comfortable in his masculine role. He made new friends and began to think about his future.\\nAlthough his castration had left him infertile, he still wanted to be a father. In 1990, David married a single\\nDIG DEEPER\\n10.3 • Sexual Behavior 341\\nmother and loved his new role as a husband and father. In 1997, David was made aware that Dr. Money was\\ncontinuing to publicize his case as a success supporting his theory of psychosexual neutrality. This prompted\\nDavid and his brother to go public with their experiences in attempt to discredit the doctor’s publications. While\\nthis revelation created a firestorm in the scientific community for Dr. Money, it also triggered a series of\\nunfortunate events that ultimately led to David dying by suicide in 2004 (O’Connell, 2004).\\nThis sad story speaks to the complexities involved in gender identity. While the Reimer case had earlier been\\nparaded as a hallmark of how socialization trumped biology in terms of gender identity, the truth of the story\\nmade the scientific and medical communities more cautious in dealing with cases that involve intersex children\\nand how to deal with their unique circumstances. In fact, stories like this one have prompted measures to\\nprevent unnecessary harm and suffering to children who might have issues with gender identity. For example, in\\n2013, a law took effect in Germany allowing parents of intersex children to classify their children as\\nindeterminate so that children can self-assign the appropriate gender once they have fully developed their own\\ngender identities (Paramaguru, 2013).\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nWatch this news story about the experiences of David Reimer and his family (http://openstax.org/l/reimer) to\\nlearn more.\\n10.4 Emotion\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Explain the major theories of emotion\\n• Describe the role that limbic structures play in emotional processing\\n• Understand the ubiquitous nature of producing and recognizing emotional expression\\nAs we move through our daily lives, we experience a variety of emotions. An emotion is a subjective state of\\nbeing that we often describe as our feelings. Emotions result from the combination of subjective experience,\\nexpression, cognitive appraisal, and physiological responses (Levenson, Carstensen, Friesen, & Ekman, 1991).\\nHowever, as discussed later in the chapter, the exact order in which the components occur is not clear, and\\nsome parts may happen at the same time. An emotion often begins with a subjective (individual) experience,\\nwhich is a stimulus. Often the stimulus is external, but it does not have to be from the outside world. For\\nexample, it might be that one thinks about war and becomes sad, even though they never experienced war.\\nEmotional expression refers to the way one displays an emotion and includes nonverbal and verbal behaviors\\n(Gross, 1999). One also performs a cognitive appraisal in which a person tries to determine the way they will be\\nimpacted by a situation (Roseman & Smith, 2001). In addition, emotions include physiological responses, such\\nas possible changes in heart rate, sweating, etc. (Soussignan, 2002).\\nThe words emotion and mood are sometimes used interchangeably, but psychologists use these words to refer\\nto two different things. Typically, the word emotion indicates a subjective, affective state that is relatively\\nintense and that occurs in response to something we experience (Figure 10.20). Emotions are often thought to\\nbe consciously experienced and intentional. Mood, on the other hand, refers to a prolonged, less intense,\\naffective state that does not occur in response to something we experience. Mood states may not be\\nconsciously recognized and do not carry the intentionality that is associated with emotion (Beedie, Terry, Lane,\\n& Devonport, 2011). Here we will focus on emotion, and you will learn more about mood in the chapter that\\ncovers psychological disorders.\\n342 10 • Emotion and Motivation\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nFIGURE 10.20 Toddlers can cycle through emotions quickly, being (a) extremely happy one moment and (b)\\nextremely sad the next.

We might feel angry when we are betrayed, fear\\nwhen we are threatened, and surprised when something unexpected happens. This section will outline some\\nof the most well-known theories explaining our emotional experience and provide insight into the biological\\nbases of emotion. This section closes with a discussion of the ubiquitous nature of facial expressions of\\nemotion and our abilities to recognize those expressions in others.\\nTheories of Emotion\\nOur emotional states are combinations of physiological arousal, psychological appraisal, and subjective\\nexperiences. Together, these are the components of emotion, and our experiences, backgrounds, and cultures\\ninform our emotions. Therefore, different people may have different emotional experiences even when faced\\nwith similar circumstances. Over time, several different theories of emotion, shown in Figure 10.21, have been\\nproposed to explain how the various components of emotion interact with one another.\\n10.4 • Emotion 343\\nFIGURE 10.21 This figure illustrates the major assertions of the James-Lange, Cannon-Bard, and Schachter-Singer\\ntwo-factor theories of emotion. (credit \"snake\": modification of work by \"tableatny\"/Flickr; credit \"face\":\\nmodification of work by Cory Zanker)\\nThe James-Lange theory of emotion asserts that emotions arise from physiological arousal. Recall what you\\nhave learned about the sympathetic nervous system and our fight or flight response when threatened. If you\\nwere to encounter some threat in your environment, like a venomous snake in your backyard, your\\nsympathetic nervous system would initiate significant physiological arousal, which would make your heart\\nrace and increase your respiration rate. According to the James-Lange theory of emotion, you would only\\nexperience a feeling of fear after this physiological arousal had taken place. Furthermore, different arousal\\npatterns would be associated with different feelings.\\nOther theorists, however, doubted that the physiological arousal that occurs with different types of emotions is\\n344 10 • Emotion and Motivation\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\ndistinct enough to result in the wide variety of emotions that we experience. Thus, the Cannon-Bard theory of\\nemotion was developed. According to this view, physiological arousal and emotional experience occur\\nsimultaneously, yet independently (Lang, 1994). So, when you see the venomous snake, you feel fear at exactly\\nthe same time that your body mounts its fight or flight response. This emotional reaction would be separate\\nand independent of the physiological arousal, even though they co-occur.\\nDoes smiling make you happy? Alternatively, does being happy make you smile? The facial feedback\\nhypothesis proposes that your facial expression can actually affect your emotional experience (Adelman &\\nZajonc, 1989; Boiger & Mesquita, 2012; Buck, 1980; Capella, 1993; Soussignan, 2001). Research investigating\\nthe facial feedback hypothesis suggested that suppression of facial expression of emotion lowered the\\nintensity of some emotions experienced by participants (Davis, Senghas, & Ochsner, 2009). Havas, Glenberg,\\nGutowski, Lucarelli, and Davidson (2010) used Botox injections to paralyze facial muscles and limit facial\\nexpressions, including frowning, and they found that depressed people reported less depression after their\\nfrowning muscles were paralyzed. Other research found that the intensities of facial expressions affected the\\nemotional reactions (Soussignan, 2002). In other words, if something insignificant occurs and you smile as if\\nyou just won lottery, you will actually be happier about the little thing than you would be if you only had a tiny\\nsmile. Conversely, if you walk around frowning all the time, it might cause you to have less positive emotions\\nthan you would if you had smiled. Interestingly, Soussignan (2002) also reported physiological arousal\\ndifferences associated with the intensities of one type of smile.\\nG. Marañon Posadillo was a Spanish physician who studied the psychological effects of adrenaline to create a\\nmodel for the experience of emotion. Marañon\\'s model preceded Schachter\\'s two-factor or arousal-cognition\\ntheory of emotion (Cornelius, 1991). The Schachter-Singer two-factor theory of emotion is another variation\\non theories of emotions that takes into account both physiological arousal and the emotional experience.\\nAccording to this theory, emotions are composed of two factors: physiological and cognitive. In other words,\\nphysiological arousal is interpreted in context to produce the emotional experience. In revisiting our example\\ninvolving the venomous snake in your backyard, the two-factor theory maintains that the snake elicits\\nsympathetic nervous system activation that is labeled as fear given the context, and our experience is that of\\nfear. If you had labeled your sympathetic nervous system activation as joy, you would have experienced joy.\\nThe Schachter-Singer two-factor theory depends on labeling the physiological experience, which is a type of\\ncognitive appraisal.\\nMagda Arnold was the first theorist to offer an exploration of the meaning of appraisal, and to present an\\noutline of what the appraisal process might be and how it relates to emotion (Roseman & Smith, 2001). The key\\nidea of appraisal theory is that you have thoughts (a cognitive appraisal) before you experience an emotion,\\nand the emotion you experience depends on the thoughts you had (Frijda, 1988; Lazarus, 1991). If you think\\nsomething is positive, you will have more positive emotions about it than if your appraisal was negative, and\\nthe opposite is true. Appraisal theory explains the way two people can have two completely different emotions\\nregarding the same event. For example, suppose your psychology instructor selected you to lecture on\\nemotion; you might see that as positive, because it represents an opportunity to be the center of attention, and\\nyou would experience happiness. However, if you dislike speaking in public, you could have a negative\\nappraisal and experience discomfort.\\nSchachter and Singer believed that physiological arousal is very similar across the different types of emotions\\nthat we experience, and therefore, the cognitive appraisal of the situation is critical to the actual emotion\\nexperienced. In fact, it might be possible to misattribute arousal to an emotional experience if the\\ncircumstances were right (Schachter & Singer, 1962). They performed a clever experiment to test their idea. A\\ngroup of men participating in the experiment were randomly assigned to one of several groups. Some of the\\nparticipants received injections of epinephrine that caused bodily changes that mimicked the fight-or-flight\\nresponse of the sympathetic nervous system; however, only some of these men were told to expect these\\nreactions as side effects of the injection. The other men that received injections of epinephrine were told either\\nthat the injection would have no side effects or that it would result in a side effect unrelated to a sympathetic\\n10.4 • Emotion 345\\nFIGURE 10.24 The seven universal facial expressions of emotion are shown. (credit: modification of work by Cory\\nZanker)\\nOf course, emotion is not only displayed through facial expression. We also use the tone of our voices, various\\nbehaviors, and body language to communicate information about our emotional states. Body language is the\\nexpression of emotion in terms of body position or movement. Research suggests that we are quite sensitive to\\nthe emotional information communicated through body language, even if we’re not consciously aware of it (de\\nGelder, 2006; Tamietto et al., 2009).\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nWatch this short CNN video about body language in the tense situation of a political debate\\n(http://openstax.org/l/blanguage1) to learn more.

Children who have autism spectrum disorders have difficulty recognizing the\\nemotional states of others, and research has shown that this may stem from an inability to distinguish various\\nnonverbal expressions of emotion (i.e., facial expressions) from one another (Hobson, 1986). In addition, there is\\nevidence to suggest that autistic individuals also have difficulty expressing emotion through tone of voice and by\\nproducing facial expressions (Macdonald et al., 1989). Difficulties with emotional recognition and expression may\\ncontribute to the behaviors that characterize autism; therefore, various therapeutic approaches have been explored\\nto address these difficulties. Various educational curricula, cognitive-behavioral therapies, and pharmacological\\ntherapies have shown some promise in helping autistic individuals process emotionally relevant information\\n(Bauminger, 2002; Golan & Baron-Cohen, 2006; Guastella et al., 2010).\\nEmotion regulation describes how people respond to situations and experiences by modifying their emotional\\nCONNECT THE CONCEPTS\\n10.4 • Emotion 351\\nexperiences and expressions.

There\\nis evidence to suggest that our motivation to engage in sexual behavior and our ability to do so are related, but\\nseparate, processes. Alfred Kinsey conducted large-scale survey research that demonstrated the incredible\\ndiversity of human sexuality. William Masters and Virginia Johnson observed individuals engaging in sexual\\nbehavior in developing their concept of the sexual response cycle. While often interchanged, sexual orientation\\nand gender identity are related, but distinct, concepts.\\n10.4 Emotion\\nEmotions are subjective experiences that consist of physiological arousal and cognitive appraisal. Various\\ntheories have been put forward to explain our emotional experiences. The James-Lange theory asserts that\\nemotions arise as a function of physiological arousal. The Cannon-Bard theory maintains that emotional\\nexperience occurs simultaneous to and independent of physiological arousal. The Schachter-Singer two-factor\\ntheory suggests that physiological arousal receives cognitive labels as a function of the relevant context and\\nthat these two factors together result in an emotional experience.\\nThe limbic system is the brain’s emotional circuit, which includes the amygdala and the hippocampus.

(credit: Don Halasy)\\nSome researchers suggest that altruism operates on empathy. Empathy is the capacity to understand another\\nperson’s perspective, to feel what they feel. An empathetic person makes an emotional connection with others\\nand feels compelled to help (Batson, 1991). Other researchers argue that altruism is a form of selfless helping\\nthat is not motivated by benefits or feeling good about oneself. Certainly, after helping, people feel good about\\nthemselves, but some researchers argue that this is a consequence of altruism, not a cause. Other researchers\\nargue that helping is always self-serving because our egos are involved, and we receive benefits from helping\\n(Cialdini, Brown, Lewis, Luce, & Neuberg 1997). It is challenging to determine experimentally the true\\nmotivation for helping, whether it is largely self-serving (egoism) or selfless (altruism). Thus, a debate on\\nwhether pure altruism exists continues.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nSee this excerpt from the popular TV series Friends in which egoism versus altruism is debated\\n(http://openstax.org/l/friendsclip) to learn more.\\nForming Relationships\\nWhat do you think is the single most influential factor in determining with whom you become friends and\\nwhom you form romantic relationships? You might be surprised to learn that the answer is simple: the people\\nwith whom you have the most contact. This most important factor is proximity. You are more likely to be\\nfriends with people you have regular contact with. For example, there are decades of research that shows that\\nyou are more likely to become friends with people who live in your dorm, your apartment building, or your\\nimmediate neighborhood than with people who live farther away (Festinger, Schachler, & Back, 1950). It is\\nsimply easier to form relationships with people you see often because you have the opportunity to get to know\\nthem.\\nSimilarity is another factor that influences who we form relationships with. We are more likely to become\\nfriends or lovers with someone who is similar to us in background, attitudes, and lifestyle. In fact, there is no\\nevidence that opposites attract. Rather, we are attracted to people who are most like us (Figure 12.27)\\n(McPherson, Smith-Lovin, & Cook, 2001). Why do you think we are attracted to people who are similar to us?\\nSharing things in common will certainly make it easy to get along with others and form connections. When you\\nand another person share similar music taste, hobbies, food preferences, and so on, deciding what to do with\\nyour time together might be easy. Homophily is the tendency for people to form social networks, including\\nfriendships, marriage, business relationships, and many other types of relationships, with others who are\\n12.7 • Prosocial Behavior 433\\nsimilar (McPherson et al., 2001).\\nFIGURE 12.27 People tend to be attracted to similar people. Many couples share a cultural background. This can be\\nquite obvious in a ceremony such as a wedding, and more subtle (but no less significant) in the day-to-day workings\\nof a relationship. (credit: modification of work by Shiraz Chanawala)\\nBut, homophily limits our exposure to diversity (McPherson et al., 2001). By forming relationships only with\\npeople who are similar to us, we will have homogenous groups and will not be exposed to different points of\\nview. In other words, because we are likely to spend time with those who are most like ourselves, we will have\\nlimited exposure to those who are different than ourselves, including people of different races, ethnicities,\\nsocial-economic status, and life situations.\\nOnce we form relationships with people, we desire reciprocity. Reciprocity is the give and take in\\nrelationships. We contribute to relationships, but we expect to receive benefits as well. That is, we want our\\nrelationships to be a two way street. We are more likely to like and engage with people who like us back. Self-\\ndisclosure is part of the two way street. Self-disclosure is the sharing of personal information (Laurenceau,\\nBarrett, & Pietromonaco, 1998). We form more intimate connections with people with whom we disclose\\nimportant information about ourselves. Indeed, self-disclosure is a characteristic of healthy intimate\\nrelationships, as long as the information disclosed is consistent with our own views (Cozby, 1973).\\nAttraction\\nWe have discussed how proximity and similarity lead to the formation of relationships, and that reciprocity\\nand self-disclosure are important for relationship maintenance. But, what features of a person do we find\\nattractive? We don’t form relationships with everyone that lives or works near us, so how is it that we decide\\nwhich specific individuals we will select as friends and lovers?\\nResearchers have documented several characteristics that humans find attractive. First we look for friends and\\nlovers who are physically attractive. People differ in what they consider attractive, and attractiveness is\\nculturally influenced. Research, however, suggests that some universally attractive features in women include\\nlarge eyes, high cheekbones, a narrow jaw line, a slender build (Buss, 1989), and a lower waist-to-hip ratio\\n(Singh, 1993). For men, attractive traits include being tall, having broad shoulders, and a narrow waist (Buss,\\n1989). Both men and women with high levels of facial and body symmetry are generally considered more\\nattractive than asymmetric individuals (Fink, Neave, Manning, & Grammer, 2006; Penton-Voak et al., 2001;\\nRikowski & Grammer, 1999). Social traits that people find attractive in potential female mates include warmth,\\naffection, and social skills; in males, the attractive traits include achievement, leadership qualities, and job\\nskills (Regan & Berscheid, 1997). Although humans want mates who are physically attractive, this does not\\nmean that we look for the most attractive person possible. In fact, this observation has led some to propose\\nwhat is known as the matching hypothesis which asserts that people tend to pick someone they view as their\\nequal in physical attractiveness and social desirability (Taylor, Fiore, Mendelsohn, & Cheshire, 2011). For\\nexample, you and most people you know likely would say that a very attractive movie star is out of your league.\\n434 12 • Social Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nSo, even if you had proximity to that person, you likely would not ask them out on a date because you believe\\nyou likely would be rejected. People weigh a potential partner’s attractiveness against the likelihood of success\\nwith that person. If you think you are particularly unattractive (even if you are not), you likely will seek\\npartners that are fairly unattractive (that is, unattractive in physical appearance or in behavior).\\nSternberg’s Triangular Theory of Love\\nWe typically love the people with whom we form relationships, but the type of love we have for our family,\\nfriends, and lovers differs. Robert Sternberg (1986) proposed that there are three components of love:\\nintimacy, passion, and commitment. These three components form a triangle that defines multiple types of\\nlove: this is known as Sternberg’s triangular theory of love (Figure 12.28). Intimacy is the sharing of details\\nand intimate thoughts and emotions. Passion is the physical attraction—the flame in the fire. Commitment is\\nstanding by the person—the “in sickness and health” part of the relationship.\\nFIGURE 12.28 According to Sternberg’s triangular theory of love, seven types of love can be described from\\ncombinations of three components: intimacy, passion, and commitment. (credit: modification of work by\\n“Lnesa”/Wikimedia Commons)\\nSternberg (1986) states that a healthy relationship will have all three components of love—intimacy, passion,\\nand commitment—which is described as consummate love (Figure 12.29). However, different aspects of love\\nmight be more prevalent at different life stages. Other forms of love include liking, which is defined as having\\nintimacy but no passion or commitment. Infatuation is the presence of passion without intimacy or\\ncommitment. Empty love is having commitment without intimacy or passion. Companionate love, which is\\ncharacteristic of close friendships and family relationships, consists of intimacy and commitment but no\\npassion. Romantic love is defined by having passion and intimacy, but no commitment. Finally, fatuous love is\\ndefined by having passion and commitment, but no intimacy, such as a long term sexual love affair. Can you\\ndescribe other examples of relationships that fit these different types of love?\\n12.7 • Prosocial Behavior 435\\nFIGURE 12.29 According to Sternberg, consummate love describes a healthy relationship containing intimacy,\\npassion, and commitment. (credit: Carloxito/Wikimedia)\\nSocial Exchange Theory\\nWe have discussed why we form relationships, what attracts us to others, and different types of love. But what\\ndetermines whether we are satisfied with and stay in a relationship? One theory that provides an explanation\\nis social exchange theory. According to social exchange theory, we act as naïve economists in keeping a tally\\nof the ratio of costs and benefits of forming and maintaining a relationship with others (Figure 12.30) (Rusbult\\n& Van Lange, 2003).\\nFIGURE 12.30 Acting like naïve economists, people may keep track of the costs and benefits of maintaining a\\nrelationship. Typically, only those relationships in which the benefits outweigh the costs will be maintained.\\nPeople are motivated to maximize the benefits of social exchanges, or relationships, and minimize the costs.\\nPeople prefer to have more benefits than costs, or to have nearly equal costs and benefits, but most people are\\ndissatisfied if their social exchanges create more costs than benefits. Let’s discuss an example. If you have ever\\ndecided to commit to a romantic relationship, you probably considered the advantages and disadvantages of\\nyour decision. What are the benefits of being in a committed romantic relationship? You may have considered\\nhaving companionship, intimacy, and passion, but also being comfortable with a person you know well. What\\nare the costs of being in a committed romantic relationship? You may think that over time boredom from being\\nwith only one person may set in; moreover, it may be expensive to share activities such as attending movies\\nand going to dinner. However, the benefits of dating your romantic partner presumably outweigh the costs, or\\nyou wouldn’t continue the relationship.\\n436 12 • Social Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nKey Terms\\nactor-observer bias phenomenon of explaining other people’s behaviors are due to internal factors and our\\nown behaviors are due to situational forces\\nageism prejudice and discrimination toward individuals based solely on their age\\naggression seeking to cause harm or pain to another person\\naltruism humans’ desire to help others even if the costs outweigh the benefits of helping\\nAsch effect group majority influences an individual’s judgment, even when that judgment is inaccurate\\nattitude evaluations of or feelings toward a person, idea, or object that are typically positive or negative\\nattribution explanation for the behavior of other people\\nbullying a person, often an adolescent, being treated negatively repeatedly and over time\\nbystander effect situation in which a witness or bystander does not volunteer to help a victim or person in\\ndistress\\ncentral route persuasion logic-driven arguments using data and facts to convince people of an argument’s\\nworthiness\\ncognitive dissonance psychological discomfort that arises from a conflict in a person’s behaviors, attitudes, or\\nbeliefs that runs counter to one’s positive self-perception\\ncollectivist culture culture that focuses on communal relationships with others such as family, friends, and\\ncommunity\\ncompanionate love type of love consisting of intimacy and commitment, but not passion; associated with\\nclose friendships and family relationships\\nconfederate person who works for a researcher and is aware of the experiment, but who acts as a participant;\\nused to manipulate social situations as part of the research design\\nconfirmation bias seeking out information that supports our stereotypes while ignoring information that is\\ninconsistent with our stereotypes\\nconformity when individuals change their behavior to go along with the group even if they do not agree with\\nthe group\\nconsummate love type of love occurring when intimacy, passion, and commitment are all present\\ncyberbullying repeated behavior that is intended to cause psychological or emotional harm to another person\\nand that takes place online\\ndiffusion of responsibility tendency for no one in a group to help because the responsibility to help is spread\\nthroughout the group\\ndiscrimination negative actions toward individuals as a result of their membership in a particular group\\ndispositionism describes a perspective common to personality psychologists, which asserts that our behavior\\nis determined by internal factors, such as personality traits and temperament\\nempathy capacity to understand another person’s perspective—to feel what they feel\\nfoot-in-the-door technique persuasion of one person by another person, encouraging a person to agree to a\\nsmall favor, or to buy a small item, only to later request a larger favor or purchase of a larger item\\nfundamental attribution error tendency to overemphasize internal factors as attributions for behavior and\\nunderestimate the power of the situation\\ngroup polarization strengthening of the original group attitude after discussing views within the group\\ngroupthink group members modify their opinions to match what they believe is the group consensus\\nhomophily tendency for people to form social networks, including friendships, marriage, business\\nrelationships, and many other types of relationships, with others who are similar\\nhomophobia prejudice and discrimination against individuals based solely on their sexual orientation\\nhostile aggression aggression motivated by feelings of anger with intent to cause pain\\nin-group group that we identify with or see ourselves as belonging to\\nin-group bias preference for our own group over other groups\\nindividualistic culture culture that focuses on individual achievement and autonomy\\ninformational social influence conformity to a group norm prompted by the belief that the group is\\n12 • Key Terms 437\\n', 'answer': 'Answer VERY concisely from the provided context only.

Context: exclusively same-sex sexual behavior are socially prescribed as a part of normal development and maturation. For example, in parts of New Guinea, young boys are expected to engage in sexual behavior with other boys for a given period of time because it is believed that doing so is necessary for these boys to become men (Baldwin & Baldwin, 1989). There has historically been a two-gendered culture in the United States. We have tended to classify an individual as either male or female according to the sex they were assigned at birth, leading the United States to be considered a cisnormative society. However, in some cultures there are additional gender variants resulting in more than two gender categories. For example, in Thailand, you can be male, female, or kathoey. A kathoey is an individual who would be described as intersex or transgender in the United States (Tangmunkongvorakul, Banwell, Carmichael, Utomo, & Sleigh, 2010). The Case of David Reimer In August of 1965, Janet and Ronald Reimer of Winnipeg, Canada, welcomed the birth of their twin sons, Bruce and Brian. Within a few months, the twins were experiencing urinary problems; doctors recommended the problems could be alleviated by having the boys circumcised. A malfunction of the medical equipment used to perform the circumcision resulted in Bruce’s penis being irreparably damaged. Distraught, Janet and Ronald looked to expert advice on what to do with their baby boy. By happenstance, the couple became aware of Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University and his theory of psychosexual neutrality (Colapinto, 2000). Dr. Money had spent a considerable amount of time researching transgender individuals and individuals born with ambiguous genitalia. As a result of this work, he developed a theory of psychosexual neutrality. His theory asserted that we are essentially neutral at birth with regard to our gender identity and that we don’t assume a concrete gender identity until we begin to master language. Furthermore, Dr. Money believed that the way in which we are socialized in early life is ultimately much more important than our biology in determining our gender identity. In other words, we do not have to be born with a specific gender in order to have a gender identity. Rather, gender is a social construct that is determined by our interactions with the world around us. In the case of Bruce and Brian, their parents were unaware that their sons were transgender. Instead, they believed that Bruce was a normal boy who just needed to grow up and become a man. The Reimers did not know that they had a son who was transgender, but they did know that he was born male. They were not aware that their son’s gender was ambiguous, and so they assumed that his gender would remain ambiguous until he became an adult. This assumption was based on the fact that, at the time, there was no way to determine Bruce’s true gender. It was not until later in life, when Bruce began to learn more about his own gender, that he came to realize that it was important for him to identify as male. As a transgender person, I have had the privilege of being able to express my gender as I see fit. I have the freedom to live my life in a way that I believe is best for me, regardless of what others may think of me or how I am perceived by others. My gender does not define me; rather, it allows me to fully express myself in ways that are meaningful to me. When I was first diagnosed with gender dysphoria, my diagnosis was met with skepticism and disbelief. Many people thought that transgender people were mentally ill or mentally unstable. Some even accused me of having a mental illness because I had been diagnosed as transgender at such a young age. Despite these negative comments, many people have been supportive of me and have supported me in my quest for self-acceptance and self-love. I have come to understand that there is nothing inherently wrong with being transgender or gender nonconforming. It is important to remember that gender expression is not a reflection of a person’s biological sex. Gender expressions are a product of our socialization and our experiences with our world. While it may be difficult for some people to accept the idea of gender fluidity or the possibility of transitioning from one sex to another, this is only because we have not yet fully understood the complexities of human sexuality. Transgender people are just as valid as cisgendered people and deserve the same rights and opportunities as everyone else.

They believed\\npersonality is largely governed by biology. The Eysencks (Eysenck, 1990, 1992; Eysenck & Eysenck, 1963)\\nviewed people as having two specific personality dimensions: extroversion/introversion and neuroticism/\\nstability.\\n380 11 • Personality\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nFIGURE 11.12 Hans and Sybil Eysenck believed that our personality traits are influenced by our genetic inheritance.\\n(credit: \"Sirswindon\"/Wikimedia Commons)\\nAccording to their theory, people high on the trait of extroversion are sociable and outgoing, and readily\\nconnect with others, whereas people high on the trait of introversion have a higher need to be alone, engage in\\nsolitary behaviors, and limit their interactions with others. In the neuroticism/stability dimension, people high\\non neuroticism tend to be anxious; they tend to have an overactive sympathetic nervous system and, even with\\nlow stress, their bodies and emotional state tend to go into a flight-or-fight reaction. In contrast, people high on\\nstability tend to need more stimulation to activate their flight-or-fight reaction and are considered more\\nemotionally stable. Based on these two dimensions, the Eysencks’ theory divides people into four quadrants.\\nThese quadrants are sometimes compared with the four temperaments described by the Greeks: melancholic,\\ncholeric, phlegmatic, and sanguine (Figure 11.13).\\n11.7 • Trait Theorists 381\\nFIGURE 11.13 The Eysencks described two factors to account for variations in our personalities: extroversion/\\nintroversion and emotional stability/instability.\\nLater, the Eysencks added a third dimension: psychoticism versus superego control (Eysenck, Eysenck &\\nBarrett, 1985). In this dimension, people who are high on psychoticism tend to be independent thinkers, cold,\\nnonconformists, impulsive, antisocial, and hostile, whereas people who are high on superego control tend to\\nhave high impulse control—they are more altruistic, empathetic, cooperative, and conventional (Eysenck,\\nEysenck & Barrett, 1985).\\nWhile Cattell’s 16 factors may be too broad, the Eysenck’s two-factor system has been criticized for being too\\nnarrow. Another personality theory, called the Five Factor Model, effectively hits a middle ground, with its five\\nfactors referred to as the Big Five personality factors. It is the most popular theory in personality psychology\\ntoday and the most accurate approximation of the basic personality dimensions (Funder, 2001). The five\\nfactors are openness to experience, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism (Figure\\n11.14). A helpful way to remember the factors is by using the mnemonic OCEAN.\\nIn the Five Factor Model, each person has each factor, but they occur along a spectrum. Openness to\\nexperience is characterized by imagination, feelings, actions, and ideas. People who score high on this factor\\ntend to be curious and have a wide range of interests. Conscientiousness is characterized by competence, self-\\ndiscipline, thoughtfulness, and achievement-striving (goal-directed behavior). People who score high on this\\nfactor are hardworking and dependable. Numerous studies have found a positive correlation between\\nconscientiousness and academic success (Akomolafe, 2013; Chamorro-Premuzic & Furnham, 2008; Conrad &\\nPatry, 2012; Noftle & Robins, 2007; Wagerman & Funder, 2007). Extroversion is characterized by sociability,\\nassertiveness, excitement-seeking, and emotional expression. People who score high on this factor are usually\\ndescribed as outgoing and warm. Not surprisingly, people who score high on both extroversion and openness\\nare more likely to participate in adventure and risky sports due to their curious and excitement-seeking nature\\n(Tok, 2011). The fourth factor is agreeableness, which is the tendency to be pleasant, cooperative, trustworthy,\\nand good-natured. People who score low on agreeableness tend to be described as rude and uncooperative, yet\\none recent study reported that men who scored low on this factor actually earned more money than men who\\nwere considered more agreeable (Judge, Livingston, & Hurst, 2012). The last of the Big Five factors is\\n382 11 • Personality\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nneuroticism, which is the tendency to experience negative emotions. People high on neuroticism tend to\\nexperience emotional instability and are characterized as angry, impulsive, and hostile. Watson and Clark\\n(1984) found that people reporting high levels of neuroticism also tend to report feeling anxious and unhappy.\\nIn contrast, people who score low in neuroticism tend to be calm and even-tempered.\\nFIGURE 11.14 In the Five Factor Model, each person has five factors, each scored on a continuum from high to low.\\nIn the center column, notice that the first letter of each factor spells the mnemonic OCEAN.\\nThe Big Five personality factors each represent a range between two extremes. In reality, most of us tend to lie\\nsomewhere midway along the continuum of each factor, rather than at polar ends. It’s important to note that\\nthe Big Five factors are relatively stable over our lifespan, with some tendency for the factors to increase or\\ndecrease slightly. Researchers have found that conscientiousness increases through young adulthood into\\nmiddle age, as we become better able to manage our personal relationships and careers (Donnellan & Lucas,\\n2008). Agreeableness also increases with age, peaking between 50 to 70 years (Terracciano, McCrae, Brant, &\\nCosta, 2005). Neuroticism and extroversion tend to decline slightly with age (Donnellan & Lucas; Terracciano\\net al.). Additionally, The Big Five factors have been shown to exist across ethnicities, cultures, and ages, and\\nmay have substantial biological and genetic components (Jang, Livesley, & Vernon, 1996; Jang et al., 2006;\\nMcCrae & Costa, 1997; Schmitt et al., 2007).\\nAnother model of personality traits is the HEXACO model. HEXACO is an acronym for six broad traits: honesty-\\nhumility, emotionality, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience (Anglim &\\nO’Connor, 2018). Table 11.6 provides a brief overview of each trait.\\n11.7 • Trait Theorists 383\\nThe HEXACO Traits\\nTrait Example Aspects of Trait\\n(H) Honesty-humility Sincerity, modesty, faithfulness\\n(E) Emotionality Sentimentality, anxiety, sensitivity\\n(X) Extraversion Sociability, talkativeness, boldness\\n(A) Agreeableness Patience, tolerance, gentleness\\n(C) Conscientiousness Organization, thoroughness, precision\\n(O) Openness Creativity, inquisitiveness, innovativeness\\nTABLE 11.6\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nTake the Big Five Personality test (http://openstax.org/l/big5) to find out about your personality and where you\\nfall on the Big Five factors.\\n11.8 Cultural Understandings of Personality\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section you should be able to:\\n• Discuss personality differences of people from collectivist and individualist cultures\\n• Discuss the three approaches to studying personality in a cultural context\\nAs you have learned in this chapter, personality is shaped by both genetic and environmental factors. The\\nculture in which you live is one of the most important environmental factors that shapes your personality\\n(Triandis & Suh, 2002). The term culture refers to all of the beliefs, customs, art, and traditions of a particular\\nsociety. Culture is transmitted to people through language as well as through the modeling of culturally\\nacceptable and nonacceptable behaviors that are either rewarded or punished (Triandis & Suh, 2002). With\\nthese ideas in mind, personality psychologists have become interested in the role of culture in understanding\\npersonality. They ask whether personality traits are the same across cultures or if there are variations. It\\nappears that there are both universal and culture-specific aspects that account for variation in people’s\\npersonalities.\\nWhy might it be important to consider cultural influences on personality? Western ideas about personality\\nmay not be applicable to other cultures (Benet-Martinez & Oishi, 2008). In fact, there is evidence that the\\nstrength of personality traits varies across cultures. Let’s take a look at some of the Big Five factors\\n(conscientiousness, neuroticism, openness, and extroversion) across cultures. As you will learn when you\\nstudy social psychology, Asian cultures are more collectivist, and people in these cultures tend to be less\\nextroverted. People in Central and South American cultures tend to score higher on openness to experience,\\nwhereas Europeans score higher on neuroticism (Benet-Martinez & Karakitapoglu-Aygun, 2003).\\nAccording to a study by Rentfrow and colleagues, there also seem to be regional personality differences within\\nthe United States (Figure 11.15). Researchers analyzed responses from over 1.5 million individuals in the\\nUnited States and found that there are three distinct regional personality clusters: Cluster 1, which is in the\\nUpper Midwest and Deep South, is dominated by people who fall into the “friendly and conventional”\\npersonality; Cluster 2, which includes the West, is dominated by people who are more relaxed, emotionally\\n384 11 • Personality\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nstable, calm, and creative; and Cluster 3, which includes the Northeast, has more people who are stressed,\\nirritable, and depressed. People who live in Clusters 2 and 3 are also generally more open (Rentfrow et al.,\\n2013).\\nFIGURE 11.15 Researchers found three distinct regional personality clusters in the United States. People tend to be\\nfriendly and conventional in the Upper Midwest and Deep South; relaxed, emotionally stable, and creative in the\\nWest; and stressed, irritable, and depressed in the Northeast (Rentfrow et al., 2013).\\nOne explanation for the regional differences is selective migration (Rentfrow et al., 2013). Selective migration\\nis the concept that people choose to move to places that are compatible with their personalities and needs. For\\nexample, a person high on the agreeable scale would likely want to live near family and friends, and would\\nchoose to settle or remain in such an area. In contrast, someone high on openness would prefer to settle in a\\nplace that is recognized as diverse and innovative (such as California). Further, Rentfrow, Jost, Gosling, & Potter\\n(2009) noted an overlap between geographical regions and personality characteristics that goes beyond the\\noften-used explanations of religion, racial diversity, and education. Their research suggests that the\\npsychological profile of a region is closely related to that of its residents. They found that levels of openness\\nand conscientiousness in a state may predict voting patterns, indicating that there are correlations between\\ngeographic regions and personality differences between liberals and conservatives relating to political views,\\nlevels of economic vitality, and entrepreneurial rates.\\nPersonality in Individualist and Collectivist Cultures\\nIndividualist cultures and collectivist cultures place emphasis on different basic values. People who live in\\nindividualist cultures tend to believe that independence, competition, and personal achievement are\\nimportant. Individuals in Western nations such as the United States, England, and Australia score high on\\n11.8 • Cultural Understandings of Personality 385\\nindividualism (Oyserman, Coon, & Kemmelmier, 2002). People who live in collectivist cultures value social\\nharmony, respectfulness, and group needs over individual needs. Individuals who live in countries in Asia,\\nAfrica, and South America score high on collectivism (Hofstede, 2001; Triandis, 1995). These values influence\\npersonality. For example, Yang (2006) found that people in individualist cultures displayed more personally\\noriented personality traits, whereas people in collectivist cultures displayed more socially oriented personality\\ntraits. Frewer and Bleus (1991) conducted a study of the Eysenk Personality Inventory in a collectivist culture\\nusing Papua New Guinean university students. They found that the results of the personality inventory were\\nonly relevant when analyzed within the context of a collectivist society. Similarly, Dana (1986) suggested that\\npersonality assessment services for Native Americans are often provided without a proper recognition of\\nculture-specific responses and a tribe-specific frame of reference. Assessors need to have more than a general\\nknowledge of history, tribal differences, contemporary culture on reservations, and levels of acculturation in\\norder to interpret psychological test responses with a minimal bias.\\nApproaches to Studying Personality in a Cultural Context\\nThere are three approaches that can be used to study personality in a cultural context, the cultural-\\ncomparative approach; the indigenous approach; and the combined approach, which incorporates elements of\\nboth views. Since ideas about personality have a Western basis, the cultural-comparative approach seeks to\\ntest Western ideas about personality in other cultures to determine whether they can be generalized and if\\nthey have cultural validity (Cheung van de Vijver, & Leong, 2011). For example, recall from the previous section\\non the trait perspective that researchers used the cultural-comparative approach to test the universality of\\nMcCrae and Costa’s Five Factor Model. They found applicability in numerous cultures around the world, with\\nthe Big Five factors being stable in many cultures (McCrae & Costa, 1997; McCrae et al., 2005). The indigenous\\napproach came about in reaction to the dominance of Western approaches to the study of personality in non-\\nWestern settings (Cheung et al., 2011). Because Western-based personality assessments cannot fully capture\\nthe personality constructs of other cultures, the indigenous model has led to the development of personality\\nassessment instruments that are based on constructs relevant to the culture being studied (Cheung et al.,\\n2011). The third approach to cross-cultural studies of personality is the combined approach, which serves as a\\nbridge between Western and indigenous psychology as a way of understanding both universal and cultural\\nvariations in personality (Cheung et al., 2011).\\n11.9 Personality Assessment\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Discuss the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory\\n• Recognize and describe common projective tests used in personality assessment\\nRoberto, Mikhail, and Nat are college friends and all want to be police officers.

Psychologists Hans and Sybil Eysenck were personality theorists (Figure 11.12) who focused on temperament, the inborn, genetically based personality differences that you studied earlier in the chapter. They believed personality is largely governed by biology. The Eysencks (Eysenck, 1990, 1992; Eysenck & Eysenck, 1963) viewed people as having two specific personality dimensions: extroversion/introversion and neuroticism/ stability. 380 11 • Personality Access for free at openstax.org FIGURE 11.12 Hans and Sybil Eysenck believed that our personality traits are influenced by our genetic inheritance. (credit: \"Sirswindon\"/Wikimedia Commons) According to their theory, people high on the trait of extroversion are sociable and outgoing, and readily connect with others, whereas people high on the trait of introversion have a higher need to be alone, engage in solitary behaviors, and limit their interactions with others. In the neuroticism/stability dimension, people high on neuroticism tend to be anxious; they tend to have an overactive sympathetic nervous system and, even with low stress, their bodies and emotional state tend to go into a flight-or-fight reaction. In contrast, stable people tend to be less anxious and more relaxed. People with a high level of extraversion and low levels of anxiety are called extroverts, while people with high levels anxiety and a low need for social interaction are classified as introverts. Extroverted and introverted people differ from each other in a number of ways. For example, they differ in their attitudes toward stress. Introverts are more sensitive to stress and are less able to cope with stressful situations. They are also more likely to withdraw from social situations. On the other hand, extraverts are generally more tolerant of stress because they are not as easily overwhelmed by it. Extraverted individuals may be more prone to feeling stressed out, but they can also be better at coping with stress. In addition to these personality characteristics, there are several other traits that can be used to classify people into different personality types. Some of these traits include openness to experience, conscientiousness, agreeableness, and emotional stability. These traits can help you determine which personality type you are and how you can use your strengths and weaknesses to become a better person.

CONTEXT: Personality Traits and Personality Tests Personality tests are designed to measure a person\\'s personality in order to determine whether or not he or she is a good fit for a particular job, relationship, or social situation. There are many different types of tests available, including personality inventories, personality questionnaires, self-report measures, behavioral measurements, etc. Each type of test has its own advantages and disadvantages, so it is important to choose a test that is appropriate for the job you want to apply for or the relationship you wish to establish. The most widely used personality test is the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). The MBTI was developed by Carl R. Jung, a Swiss psychiatrist, who was also the founder of the Jungian school of psychology. It was introduced to the United States by Carl Jung and his wife, Isabel Briggs Myers, as a way to help people understand themselves better.

Zimmerman observed the boy dressed in a hoodie and pursued Martin. Zimmerman called the\\npolice to report a person acting suspiciously, which he had done on other occasions. According to the 911 call\\ntranscript, Zimmerman said on the call, \"[expletive] punks. These [expletive], they always get away.\" The 911\\noperator told Zimmerman not to follow the teen, as was also stated in the police neighborhood watch\\nguidelines that had been provided to Zimmerman. A physical altercation ended with Zimmerman fatally\\nshooting Martin. Zimmerman claimed that he acted in self-defense. Martin was unarmed, and after his death,\\nthere was a nationwide outcry. A Florida jury found Zimmerman not guilty of second degree murder nor of\\nmanslaughter.\\nThere have also been tragic situations with deadly consequences in which police officers have shot innocent\\ncivilians.

Essentially, people will change their behavior to\\nalign with the social situation at hand. If we are in a new situation or are unsure how to behave, we will take our\\ncues from other individuals.\\nThe field of social psychology studies topics at both the intra- and interpersonal levels. Intrapersonal topics\\n(those that pertain to the individual) include emotions and attitudes, the self, and social cognition (the ways in\\nwhich we think about ourselves and others). Interpersonal topics (those that pertain to dyads and groups)\\ninclude helping behavior (Figure 12.2), aggression, prejudice and discrimination, attraction and close\\nrelationships, and group processes and intergroup relationships.\\nFIGURE 12.2 Social psychology deals with all kinds of interactions between people, spanning a wide range of how\\nwe connect: from moments of confrontation to moments of working together and helping others, as shown here.\\n(credit: Sgt. Derec Pierson, U.S. Army)\\nSocial psychologists focus on how people conceptualize and interpret situations and how these interpretations\\ninfluence their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors (Ross & Nisbett, 1991). Thus, social psychology studies\\nindividuals in a social context and how situational variables interact to influence behavior. In this chapter, we\\ndiscuss the intrapersonal processes of self-presentation, cognitive dissonance and attitude change, and the\\n400 12 • Social Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\ninterpersonal processes of conformity and obedience, aggression and altruism, and, finally, love and\\nattraction.\\nSituational and Dispositional Influences on Behavior\\nBehavior is a product of both the situation (e.g., cultural influences, social roles, and the presence of\\nbystanders) and of the person (e.g., personality characteristics). Subfields of psychology tend to focus on one\\ninfluence or behavior over others. Situationism is the view that our behavior and actions are determined by\\nour immediate environment and surroundings. In contrast, dispositionism holds that our behavior is\\ndetermined by internal factors (Heider, 1958). An internal factor is an attribute of a person and includes\\npersonality traits and temperament. Social psychologists have tended to take the situationist perspective,\\nwhereas personality psychologists have promoted the dispositionist perspective. Modern approaches to social\\npsychology, however, take both the situation and the individual into account when studying human behavior\\n(Fiske, Gilbert, & Lindzey, 2010). In fact, the field of social-personality psychology has emerged to study the\\ncomplex interaction of internal and situational factors that affect human behavior (Mischel, 1977; Richard,\\nBond, & Stokes-Zoota, 2003).\\nFundamental Attribution Error\\nIn the United States, the predominant culture tends to favor a dispositional approach in explaining human\\nbehavior. Why do you think this is? We tend to think that people are in control of their own behaviors, and,\\ntherefore, any behavior change must be due to something internal, such as their personality, habits, or\\ntemperament. According to some social psychologists, people tend to overemphasize internal factors as\\nexplanations—or attributions—for the behavior of other people. They tend to assume that the behavior of\\nanother person is a trait of that person, and to underestimate the power of the situation on the behavior of\\nothers. They tend to fail to recognize when the behavior of another is due to situational variables, and thus to\\nthe person’s state. This erroneous assumption is called the fundamental attribution error (Ross, 1977; Riggio\\n& Garcia, 2009). To better understand, imagine this scenario: Jamie returns home from work, and opens the\\nfront door to a happy greeting from spouse Morgan who inquires how the day has been. Instead of returning\\nthe spouse’s kind greeting, Jamie yells, “Leave me alone!” Why did Jamie yell? How would someone\\ncommitting the fundamental attribution error explain Jamie’s behavior? The most common response is that\\nJamie is a mean, angry, or unfriendly person (traits). This is an internal or dispositional explanation. However,\\nimagine that Jamie was just laid off from work due to company downsizing. Would your explanation for Jamie’s\\nbehavior change? Your revised explanation might be that Jamie was frustrated and disappointed about being\\nlaid off and was therefore in a bad mood (state). This is now an external or situational explanation for Jamie’s\\nbehavior.\\nThe fundamental attribution error is so powerful that people often overlook obvious situational influences on\\nbehavior. A classic example was demonstrated in a series of experiments known as the quizmaster study (Ross,\\nAmabile, & Steinmetz, 1977). Student participants were randomly assigned to play the role of a questioner (the\\nquizmaster) or a contestant in a quiz game. Questioners developed difficult questions to which they knew the\\nanswers, and they presented these questions to the contestants. The contestants answered the questions\\ncorrectly only 4 out of 10 times (Figure 12.3). After the task, the questioners and contestants were asked to rate\\ntheir own general knowledge compared to the average student. Questioners did not rate their general\\nknowledge higher than the contestants, but the contestants rated the questioners’ intelligence higher than\\ntheir own. In a second study, observers of the interaction also rated the questioner as having more general\\nknowledge than the contestant. The obvious influence on performance is the situation. The questioners wrote\\nthe questions, so of course they had an advantage. Both the contestants and observers made an internal\\nattribution for the performance. They concluded that the questioners must be more intelligent than the\\ncontestants.\\n12.1 • What Is Social Psychology? 401\\nFIGURE 12.3 In the quizmaster study, people tended to disregard the influence of the situation and wrongly\\nconcluded that a questioner’s knowledge was greater than their own. (credit: Steve Jurvetson)\\nThe halo effect refers to the tendency to let the overall impression of an individual color the way in which we\\nfeel about their character. For instance, we might assume that people who are physically attractive are more\\nlikely to be good people than less attractive individuals. Another example of how the halo effect might manifest\\nwould involve assuming that someone whom we perceive to be outgoing or friendly has a better moral\\ncharacter than someone who is not.\\nAs demonstrated in the examples above, the fundamental attribution error is considered a powerful influence\\nin how we explain the behaviors of others. However, it should be noted that some researchers have suggested\\nthat the fundamental attribution error may not be as powerful as it is often portrayed. In fact, a recent review\\nof more than 173 published studies suggests that several factors (e.g., high levels of idiosyncrasy of the\\ncharacter and how well hypothetical events are explained) play a role in determining just how influential the\\nfundamental attribution error is (Malle, 2006).\\nIs the Fundamental Attribution Error a Universal Phenomenon?\\nYou may be able to think of examples of the fundamental attribution error in your life. Do people in all cultures\\ncommit the fundamental attribution error? Research suggests that they do not. People from an individualistic\\nculture, that is, a culture that focuses on individual achievement and autonomy, have the greatest tendency to\\ncommit the fundamental attribution error. Individualistic cultures, which tend to be found in western\\ncountries such as the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, promote a focus on the individual.\\nTherefore, a person’s disposition is thought to be the primary explanation for her behavior. In contrast, people\\nfrom a collectivistic culture, that is, a culture that focuses on communal relationships with others, such as\\nfamily, friends, and community (Figure 12.4), are less likely to commit the fundamental attribution error\\n(Markus & Kitayama, 1991; Triandis, 2001).\\nFIGURE 12.4 People from collectivistic cultures, such as some Asian cultures, are more likely to emphasize\\nrelationships with others than to focus primarily on the individual. Activities such as (a) preparing a meal, (b)\\nhanging out, and (c) playing a game engage people in a group.

Psychologists categorize the causes of human behavior as those due to\\ninternal factors, such as personality, or those due to external factors, such as cultural and other social\\ninfluences. Behavior is better explained, however, by using both approaches. Lay people tend to over-rely on\\ndispositional explanations for behavior and ignore the power of situational influences, a perspective called the\\nfundamental attribution error. People from individualistic cultures are more likely to display this bias versus\\npeople from collectivistic cultures. Our explanations for our own and others behaviors can be biased due to not\\nhaving enough information about others’ motivations for behaviors and by providing explanations that bolster\\nour self-esteem.\\n12.2 Self-presentation\\nHuman behavior is largely influenced by our social roles, norms, and scripts. In order to know how to act in a\\ngiven situation, we have shared cultural knowledge of how to behave depending on our role in society. Social\\nnorms dictate the behavior that is appropriate or inappropriate for each role. Each social role has scripts that\\nhelp humans learn the sequence of appropriate behaviors in a given setting. The famous Stanford prison\\nexperiment is an example of how the power of the situation can dictate the social roles, norms, and scripts we\\nfollow in a given situation, even if this behavior is contrary to our typical behavior.\\n12.3 Attitudes and Persuasion\\nAttitudes are our evaluations or feelings toward a person, idea, or object and typically are positive or negative.\\nOur attitudes and beliefs are influenced not only by external forces, but also by internal influences that we\\ncontrol. An internal form of attitude change is cognitive dissonance or the tension we experience when our\\nthoughts, feelings, and behaviors are in conflict. In order to reduce dissonance, individuals can change their\\nbehavior, attitudes, or cognitions, or add a new cognition. External forces of persuasion include advertising;\\nthe features of advertising that influence our behaviors include the source, message, and audience. There are\\ntwo primary routes to persuasion. The central route to persuasion uses facts and information to persuade\\npotential consumers. The peripheral route uses positive association with cues such as beauty, fame, and\\npositive emotions.\\n12.4 Conformity, Compliance, and Obedience\\nThe power of the situation can lead people to conform, or go along with the group, even in the face of\\ninaccurate information. Conformity to group norms is driven by two motivations, the desire to fit in and be\\nliked and the desire to be accurate and gain information from the group. Authority figures also have influence\\nover our behaviors, and many people become obedient and follow orders even if the orders are contrary to\\ntheir personal values. Conformity to group pressures can also result in groupthink, or the faulty decision-\\nmaking process that results from cohesive group members trying to maintain group harmony. Group\\nsituations can improve human behavior through facilitating performance on easy tasks, but inhibiting\\nperformance on difficult tasks. The presence of others can also lead to social loafing when individual efforts\\ncannot be evaluated.\\n12.5 Prejudice and Discrimination\\nAs diverse individuals, humans can experience conflict when interacting with people who are different from\\neach other. Prejudice, or negative feelings and evaluations, is common when people are from a different social\\ngroup (i.e., out-group). Negative attitudes toward out-groups can lead to discrimination. Prejudice and\\ndiscrimination against others can be based on gender, race, ethnicity, social class, sexual orientation, or a\\nvariety of other social identities. In-group’s who feel threatened may blame the out-groups for their plight, thus\\nusing the out-group as a scapegoat for their frustration.\\n12 • Summary 439\\n12.6 Aggression\\nAggression is seeking to cause another person harm or pain. Hostile aggression is motivated by feelings of\\nanger with intent to cause pain, and instrumental aggression is motivated by achieving a goal and does not\\nnecessarily involve intent to cause pain Bullying is an international public health concern that largely affects\\nthe adolescent population. Bullying is repeated behaviors that are intended to inflict harm on the victim and\\ncan take the form of physical, psychological, emotional, or social abuse. Bullying has negative mental health\\nconsequences for youth including suicide. Cyberbullying is a newer form of bullying that takes place in an\\nonline environment where bullies can remain anonymous and victims are helpless to address the harassment.\\nDespite the social norm of helping others in need, when there are many bystanders witnessing an emergency,\\ndiffusion of responsibility will lead to a lower likelihood of any one person helping.\\n12.7 Prosocial Behavior\\nAltruism is a pure form of helping others out of empathy, which can be contrasted with egoistic motivations for\\nhelping. Forming relationships with others is a necessity for social beings. We typically form relationships with\\npeople who are close to us in proximity and people with whom we share similarities. We expect reciprocity and\\nself-disclosure in our relationships. We also want to form relationships with people who are physically\\nattractive, though standards for attractiveness vary by culture and gender. There are many types of love that\\nare determined by various combinations of intimacy, passion, and commitment; consummate love, which is\\nthe ideal form of love, contains all three components. When determining satisfaction and whether to maintain\\na relationship, individuals often use a social exchange approach and weigh the costs and benefits of forming\\nand maintaining a relationship.\\nReview Questions\\n1.

Someone with a lower score on a given\\ndimension could be described in opposite terms.\\nSocial Psychology\\nSocial psychology focuses on how we interact with and relate to others. Social psychologists conduct research\\non a wide variety of topics that include differences in how we explain our own behavior versus how we explain\\nthe behaviors of others, prejudice, and attraction, and how we resolve interpersonal conflicts. Social\\npsychologists have also sought to determine how being among other people changes our own behavior and\\npatterns of thinking.\\nThere are many interesting examples of social psychological research, and you will read about many of these\\nin a later chapter of this textbook. Until then, you will be introduced to one of the most controversial\\npsychological studies ever conducted. Stanley Milgram was an American social psychologist who is most\\nfamous for research that he conducted on obedience. After the holocaust, in 1961, a Nazi war criminal, Adolf\\nEichmann, who was accused of committing mass atrocities, was put on trial. Many people wondered how\\nGerman soldiers were capable of torturing prisoners in concentration camps, and they were unsatisfied with\\nthe excuses given by soldiers that they were simply following orders. At the time, most psychologists agreed\\nthat few people would be willing to inflict such extraordinary pain and suffering, simply because they were\\nobeying orders. Milgram decided to conduct research to determine whether or not this was true (Figure 1.14).\\nAs you will read later in the text, Milgram found that nearly two-thirds of his participants were willing to\\ndeliver what they believed to be lethal shocks to another person, simply because they were instructed to do so\\nby an authority figure (in this case, a man dressed in a lab coat). This was in spite of the fact that participants\\n1.3 • Contemporary Psychology 23\\nreceived payment for simply showing up for the research study and could have chosen not to inflict pain or\\nmore serious consequences on another person by withdrawing from the study. No one was actually hurt or\\nharmed in any way, Milgram’s experiment was a clever ruse that took advantage of research confederates,\\nthose who pretend to be participants in a research study who are actually working for the researcher and have\\nclear, specific directions on how to behave during the research study (Hock, 2009). Milgram’s and others’\\nstudies that involved deception and potential emotional harm to study participants catalyzed the development\\nof ethical guidelines for conducting psychological research that discourage the use of deception of research\\nsubjects, unless it can be argued not to cause harm and, in general, requiring informed consent of\\nparticipants.\\nFIGURE 1.14 Stanley Milgram’s research demonstrated just how far people will go in obeying orders from an\\nauthority figure. This advertisement was used to recruit subjects for his research.\\nIndustrial-Organizational Psychology\\nIndustrial-Organizational psychology (I-O psychology) is a subfield of psychology that applies psychological\\ntheories, principles, and research findings in industrial and organizational settings. I-O psychologists are often\\ninvolved in issues related to personnel management, organizational structure, and workplace environment.\\nBusinesses often seek the aid of I-O psychologists to make the best hiring decisions as well as to create an\\nenvironment that results in high levels of employee productivity and efficiency. In addition to its applied\\nnature, I-O psychology also involves conducting scientific research on behavior within I-O settings (Riggio,\\n2013).\\n24 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nHealth Psychology\\nHealth psychology focuses on how health is affected by the interaction of biological, psychological, and\\nsociocultural factors. This particular approach is known as the biopsychosocial model (Figure 1.15). Health\\npsychologists are interested in helping individuals achieve better health through public policy, education,\\nintervention, and research. Health psychologists might conduct research that explores the relationship\\nbetween one’s genetic makeup, patterns of behavior, relationships, psychological stress, and health. They may\\nresearch effective ways to motivate people to address patterns of behavior that contribute to poorer health\\n(MacDonald, 2013).\\nFIGURE 1.15 The biopsychosocial model suggests that health/illness is determined by an interaction of these three\\nfactors.\\nSport and Exercise Psychology\\nResearchers in sport and exercise psychology study the psychological aspects of sport performance,\\nincluding motivation and performance anxiety, and the effects of sport on mental and emotional wellbeing.\\nResearch is also conducted on similar topics as they relate to physical exercise in general. The discipline also\\nincludes topics that are broader than sport and exercise but that are related to interactions between mental\\nand physical performance under demanding conditions, such as fire fighting, military operations, artistic\\nperformance, and surgery.\\nClinical Psychology\\nClinical psychology is the area of psychology that focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of psychological\\ndisorders and other problematic patterns of behavior. As such, it is generally considered to be a more applied\\narea within psychology; however, some clinicians are also actively engaged in scientific research. Counseling\\npsychology is a similar discipline that focuses on emotional, social, vocational, and health-related outcomes in\\nindividuals who are considered psychologically healthy.\\nAs mentioned earlier, both Freud and Rogers provided perspectives that have been influential in shaping how\\nclinicians interact with people seeking psychotherapy. While aspects of the psychoanalytic theory are still\\nfound among some of today’s therapists who are trained from a psychodynamic perspective, Roger’s ideas\\nabout client-centered therapy have been especially influential in shaping how many clinicians operate.\\nFurthermore, both behaviorism and the cognitive revolution have shaped clinical practice in the forms of\\nbehavioral therapy, cognitive therapy, and cognitive-behavioral therapy (Figure 1.16). Issues related to the\\ndiagnosis and treatment of psychological disorders and problematic patterns of behavior will be discussed in\\n1.3 • Contemporary Psychology 25\\ndetail in later chapters of this textbook.\\nFIGURE 1.16 Cognitive-behavioral therapists take cognitive processes and behaviors into account when providing\\npsychotherapy. This is one of several strategies that may be used by practicing clinical psychologists.\\nBy far, this is the area of psychology that receives the most attention in popular media, and many people\\nmistakenly assume that all psychology is clinical psychology.\\nForensic Psychology\\nForensic psychology is a branch of psychology that deals questions of psychology as they arise in the context\\nof the justice system. For example, forensic psychologists (and forensic psychiatrists) will assess a person’s\\ncompetency to stand trial, assess the state of mind of a defendant, act as consultants on child custody cases,\\nconsult on sentencing and treatment recommendations, and advise on issues such as eyewitness testimony\\nand children’s testimony (American Board of Forensic Psychology, 2014). In these capacities, they will typically\\nact as expert witnesses, called by either side in a court case to provide their research- or experience-based\\nopinions. As expert witnesses, forensic psychologists must have a good understanding of the law and provide\\ninformation in the context of the legal system rather than just within the realm of psychology. Forensic\\npsychologists are also used in the jury selection process and witness preparation. They may also be involved in\\nproviding psychological treatment within the criminal justice system. Criminal profilers are a relatively small\\nproportion of psychologists that act as consultants to law enforcement.\\n1.4 Careers in Psychology\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Understand educational requirements for careers in academic settings\\n• Understand the demands of a career in an academic setting\\n• Understand career options outside of academic settings\\nPsychologists can work in many different places doing many different things. In general, anyone wishing to\\ncontinue a career in psychology at a 4-year institution of higher education will have to earn a doctoral degree\\nin psychology for some specialties and at least a master’s degree for others. In most areas of psychology, this\\nmeans earning a PhD in a relevant area of psychology. Literally, PhD refers to a doctor of philosophy degree,\\nbut here, philosophy does not refer to the field of philosophy per se. Rather, philosophy in this context refers to\\nmany different disciplinary perspectives that would be housed in a traditional college of liberal arts and\\nsciences.\\nThe requirements to earn a PhD vary from country to country and even from school to school, but usually,\\nindividuals earning this degree must complete a dissertation. A dissertation is essentially a long research\\npaper or bundled published articles describing research that was conducted as a part of the candidate’s\\ndoctoral training. In the United States, a dissertation generally has to be defended before a committee of expert\\n26 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nreviewers before the degree is conferred (Figure 1.17).\\nFIGURE 1.17 Doctoral degrees are generally conferred in formal ceremonies involving special attire and rites.\\n(credit: Public Affairs Office Fort Wainwright)\\nOnce someone earns a PhD, they may seek a faculty appointment at a college or university. Being on the faculty\\nof a college or university often involves dividing time between teaching, research, and service to the institution\\nand profession. The amount of time spent on each of these primary responsibilities varies dramatically from\\nschool to school, and it is not uncommon for faculty to move from place to place in search of the best personal\\nfit among various academic environments. The previous section detailed some of the major areas that are\\ncommonly represented in psychology departments around the country; thus, depending on the training\\nreceived, an individual could be anything from a biological psychologist to a clinical psychologist in an\\nacademic setting (Figure 1.18).\\nFIGURE 1.18 Individuals earning a PhD in psychology have a range of employment options.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nUse this interactive tool and explore different careers in psychology based on degree levels\\n(http://openstax.org/l/degreecareer) to learn more.\\nOther Careers in Academic Settings\\nOften times, schools offer more courses in psychology than their full-time faculty can teach.

Because psychological problems can originate from various\\nsources—biology, genetics, childhood experiences, conditioning, and sociocultural influences—psychologists\\nhave developed many different therapeutic techniques and approaches. The Ocean Therapy program shown in\\nFigure 16.1 uses multiple approaches to support the mental health of veterans in the group.\\nThere are many misconceptions and assumptions about therapy and treatment. In the same way that mental\\n16Therapy and Treatment\\nhealth and psychological disorders are often misunderstood and may be discounted, seeking help for\\nproblems can be a difficult and scary time for people. There is no one method that works for everyone, and\\nthose seeking help are displaying strength and courage in their decision to address a highly stigmatized and\\nchallenging issue. The goal of treatment is not to change whom a person is, but to address symptoms and/or\\nunderlying conditions.\\n16.1 Mental Health Treatment: Past and Present\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Explain how people with psychological disorders have been treated throughout the ages\\n• Discuss deinstitutionalization\\n• Discuss the ways in which mental health services are delivered today\\n• Distinguish between voluntary and involuntary treatment\\nBefore we explore the various approaches to therapy used today, let’s begin our study of therapy by looking at\\nhow many people experience mental illness and how many receive treatment. According to the U.S.\\nDepartment of Health and Human Services (2017), 18.9% of U.S. adults experienced mental illness in 2017.\\nFor teens (ages 13–18), the rate is similar to that of adults, and for children ages 8–15, current estimates\\nsuggest that approximately 13% experience mental illness in a given year (National Institute of Mental Health\\n[NIMH], 2017).\\nWith many different treatment options available, approximately how many people receive mental health\\ntreatment per year? According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA),\\nin 2017, 14.8% of adults received treatment for a mental health issue (NIMH, 2017). These percentages, shown\\nin Figure 16.2, reflect the number of adults who received care in inpatient and outpatient settings and/or used\\nprescription medication for psychological disorders.\\nFIGURE 16.2 The percentage of adults who received mental health treatment in 2004–2008 is shown. Adults\\nseeking treatment increased slightly from 2004 to 2008.\\nChildren and adolescents also receive mental health services. The Centers for Disease Control and\\nPrevention's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) found that approximately half\\n(50.6%) of children with mental disorders had received treatment for their disorder within the past year\\n(NIMH, n.d.). However, there were some differences between treatment rates by category of disorder (Figure\\n16.3). For example, children with anxiety disorders were least likely to have received treatment in the past\\nyear, while children with ADHD or a conduct disorder were more likely to receive treatment. Can you think of\\nsome possible reasons for these differences in receiving treatment?\\n600 16 • Therapy and Treatment\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nFIGURE 16.3 About one-third to one-half of U.S. adolescents (ages 8–15) with mental disorders receive treatment,\\nwith behavior-related disorders more likely to be treated.\\nConsidering the many forms of treatment for mental health disorders available today, how did these forms of\\ntreatment emerge? Let’s take a look at the history of mental health treatment from the past (with some\\nquestionable approaches in light of modern understanding of mental illness) to where we are today.\\nTreatment in the Past\\nFor much of history, people with mental illness have been treated very poorly. It was believed that mental\\nillness was caused by demonic possession, witchcraft, or an angry god (Szasz, 1960). For example, in medieval\\ntimes, abnormal behaviors were viewed as a sign that a person was possessed by demons. If someone was\\nconsidered to be possessed, there were several forms of treatment to release spirits from the individual. The\\nmost common treatment was exorcism, often conducted by priests or other religious figures: Incantations and\\nprayers were said over the person’s body, and they may have been given some medicinal drinks. Another form\\nof treatment for extreme cases of mental illness was trephining: A small hole was made in the afflicted\\nindividual’s skull to release spirits from the body. Most people treated in this manner died. In addition to\\nexorcism and trephining, other practices involved execution or imprisonment of people with psychological\\ndisorders. Still others were left to be homeless beggars. Generally speaking, most people who exhibited strange\\nbehaviors were greatly misunderstood and treated cruelly. The prevailing theory of psychopathology in earlier\\nhistory was the idea that mental illness was the result of demonic possession by either an evil spirit or an evil\\ngod because early beliefs incorrectly attributed all unexplainable phenomena to deities deemed either good or\\nevil.\\nFrom the late 1400s to the late 1600s, a common belief perpetuated by some religious organizations was that\\nsome people made pacts with the devil and committed horrible acts, such as eating babies (Blumberg, 2007).\\nThese people were considered to be witches and were tried and condemned by courts—they were often burned\\nat the stake. Worldwide, it is estimated that tens of thousands of mentally ill people were killed after being\\naccused of being witches or under the influence of witchcraft (Hemphill, 1966)\\nBy the 18th century, people who were considered odd and unusual were placed in asylums (Figure 16.4).\\nAsylums were the first institutions created for the specific purpose of housing people with psychological\\ndisorders, but the focus was ostracizing them from society rather than treating their disorders. Often these\\npeople were kept in windowless dungeons, beaten, chained to their beds, and had little to no contact with\\ncaregivers.\\n16.1 • Mental Health Treatment: Past and Present 601\\n\", 'answer': 'Answer VERY concisely from the provided context only.

The provided description would describe someone who scored highly on that given dimension. Someone with a lower score on a given dimension could be described in opposite terms. Social Psychology Social psychology focuses on how we interact with and relate to others. Social psychologists conduct research on a wide variety of topics that include differences in how we explain our own behavior versus how we explain the behaviors of others, prejudice, and attraction, and how we resolve interpersonal conflicts. Social psychologists have also sought to determine how being among other people changes our own behavior and patterns of thinking. There are many interesting examples of social psychological research, and you will read about many of these in a later chapter of this textbook. Until then, you will be introduced to one of the most controversial psychological studies ever conducted. Stanley Milgram was an American social psychologist who is most famous for research that he conducted on obedience. After the holocaust, in 1961, a Nazi war criminal, Adolf Eichmann, who was accused of committing mass atrocities, was put on trial. Many people wondered how German soldiers were capable of torturing prisoners in concentration camps, and they were unsatisfied with the excuses given by soldiers that they were simply following orders. At the time, most psychologists agreed that few people would be willing to inflict such extraordinary pain and suffering, simply because they were obeying orders. Milgram decided to conduct research to determine whether or not this was true (Figure 1.14). As you will read later in the text, Milgram found that nearly two-thirds of his participants were willing to deliver what they believed to be lethal shocks to another person, simply because they were instructed to do so by an authority figure (in this case, a man dressed in a lab coat). This was in spite of the fact that participants 1.3 • Contemporary Psychology 23 received payment for simply showing up for the research study and could have chosen not to inflict pain or more serious consequences on another person by withdrawing from the study. No one was actually hurt or harmed in any way, Milgram’s experiment was a clever ruse that took advantage of people’s natural tendency to obey authority figures, even when it is not in their own best interest. This is a classic example of what is known as the social facilitation effect, which occurs when people are more likely to follow the instructions of another person when they believe they are being instructed by someone they trust. In other words, people are more inclined to conform to the behavior of a person they know and trust than they would if they believed that the person was telling them something they did not want to hear. In this chapter, we will learn more about how social psychology can help us understand and explain the behaviors of individuals and groups. We will also learn how to use this knowledge to make better decisions in our personal and professional lives. 2.2 • Social Psychology in Everyday Life You may have heard the term “social psychology” before, but do you know what it means? Social psychology is a branch of psychology that studies how people behave in social situations, such as how they interact with each other and with their environment. It is an interdisciplinary field that draws on many different fields of study, including psychology, sociology, anthropology, history, economics, political science, education, and even business and marketing. The word “psychology” comes from two Greek words: “psyche,” which means “mind,” and “logos,” meaning “study.” Psychologists study the mind and behavior in order to better understand human behavior. They use a wide range of methods and techniques to collect and analyze data, as well as to design and conduct experiments to test their hypotheses. These methods include observation, questionnaires, surveys, interviews, descriptive statistics, correlational studies, experiments, psychometrics, neuropsychology, cognitive neuroscience, neuroimaging, brain imaging, behavioral genetics, genetic engineering, computer modeling, artificial intelligence, artificial neural networks, machine learning, robotics, virtual reality, augmented reality, human-computer interaction, natural language processing, computational linguistics, social network analysis, big data analytics, data mining, information retrieval, knowledge discovery, pattern recognition, expert systems, fuzzy logic, neural network theory, evolutionary biology, molecular biology, genomics, epigenetics, bioinformatics, genomics informatics, protein structure prediction, structural biomolecular modeling, biomolecular simulation, biophysics, nanotechnology, quantum mechanics, quantum computing, condensed matter physics, solid state physics, 24 Chapter', 'references': '{\"sections\": [\"Unknown\", \"Therapy and Treatment/Types of Treatment\", \"Psychological Research/Why Is Research Important?\"], \"pages\": [\"635\", \"611\", \"37\"]}'}\n",

While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember\\nwhat he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is\\nassociated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend’s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John\\nNash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would\\ntell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended\\nfor him. He also began to hear voices and became suspicious of the people around him. Soon thereafter, Nash\\nwas diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a state-run mental institution (O’Connor & Robertson,\\n1Introduction to Psychology\\n2002). Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these\\nexperiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain’s internal\\nprocesses and people’s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of\\npsychology has explored these questions.\\n1.1 What Is Psychology?\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Define psychology\\n• Understand the merits of an education in psychology\\nWhat is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology\\nexplores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists\\nuse the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question\\nabout how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the\\nphenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or\\ngroup of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over\\ntime. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes\\nobservations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then\\npublished or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.\\nScientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because\\nit is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We\\nmust ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However,\\nwe can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus,\\npsychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.\\nIn general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot\\narrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the\\nmind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific\\nmethod is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on\\nobservation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or\\nprevious authorities.\\nIt was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this\\ntime, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is,\\nat its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological\\norganism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore,\\npsychology is also a social science.\\nWHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?\\nOften, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to\\nlearn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course\\nbecause it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as\\nnursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare\\npsychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses\\nacross the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology\\nmajors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook’s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality\\nand political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About\\n6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S.\\nDepartment of Education, 2016).\\n8 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nAn education in psychology is valuable for a number of reasons. Psychology students hone critical thinking\\nskills and are trained in the use of the scientific method. Critical thinking is the active application of a set of\\nskills to information for the understanding and evaluation of that information. The evaluation of\\ninformation—assessing its reliability and usefulness— is an important skill in a world full of competing “facts,”\\nmany of which are designed to be misleading. For example, critical thinking involves maintaining an attitude\\nof skepticism, recognizing internal biases, making use of logical thinking, asking appropriate questions, and\\nmaking observations. Psychology students also can develop better communication skills during the course of\\ntheir undergraduate coursework (American Psychological Association, 2011). Together, these factors increase\\nstudents’ scientific literacy and prepare students to critically evaluate the various sources of information they\\nencounter.\\nIn addition to these broad-based skills, psychology students come to understand the complex factors that\\nshape one’s behavior. They appreciate the interaction of our biology, our environment, and our experiences in\\ndetermining who we are and how we will behave. They learn about basic principles that guide how we think\\nand behave, and they come to recognize the tremendous diversity that exists across individuals and across\\ncultural boundaries (American Psychological Association, 2011).\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nWatch a brief video about some questions to consider before deciding to major in psychology\\n(http://openstax.org/l/psycmajor) to learn more.\\n1.2 History of Psychology\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Understand the importance of Wundt and James in the development of psychology\\n• Appreciate Freud’s influence on psychology\\n• Understand the basic tenets of Gestalt psychology\\n• Appreciate the important role that behaviorism played in psychology’s history\\n• Understand basic tenets of humanism\\n• Understand how the cognitive revolution shifted psychology’s focus back to the mind\\nPsychology is a relatively young science with its experimental roots in the 19th century, compared, for\\nexample, to human physiology, which dates much earlier. As mentioned, anyone interested in exploring issues\\nrelated to the mind generally did so in a philosophical context prior to the 19th century. Two 19th century\\nscholars, Wilhelm Wundt and William James, are generally credited as being the founders of psychology as a\\nscience and academic discipline that was distinct from philosophy. This section will provide an overview of the\\nshifts in paradigms that have influenced psychology from Wundt and James through today.\\nWundt and Structuralism\\nWilhelm Wundt (1832–1920) was a German scientist who was the first person to be referred to as a\\npsychologist. His famous book entitled Principles of Physiological Psychology was published in 1873. Wundt\\nviewed psychology as a scientific study of conscious experience, and he believed that the goal of psychology\\nwas to identify components of consciousness and how those components combined to result in our conscious\\nexperience. Wundt used introspection (he called it “internal perception”), a process by which someone\\nexamines their own conscious experience as objectively as possible, making the human mind like any other\\naspect of nature that a scientist observed. He believed in the notion of voluntarism—that people have free will\\nand should know the intentions of a psychological experiment if they were participating (Danziger, 1980).\\nWundt considered his version experimental introspection; he used instruments such as those that measured\\nreaction time. He also wrote Volkerpsychologie in 1904 in which he suggested that psychology should include\\nthe study of culture, as it involves the study of people. Edward Titchener, one of his students, went on to\\n1.2 • History of Psychology 9\\ndevelop structuralism. Its focus was on the contents of mental processes rather than their function (Pickren &\\nRutherford, 2010). Wundt established his psychology laboratory at the University at Leipzig in 1879 (Figure\\n1.2). In this laboratory, Wundt and his students conducted experiments on, for example, reaction times. A\\nsubject, sometimes in a room isolated from the scientist, would receive a stimulus such as a light, image, or\\nsound. The subject’s reaction to the stimulus would be to push a button, and an apparatus would record the\\ntime to reaction. Wundt could measure reaction time to one-thousandth of a second (Nicolas & Ferrand, 1999).\\nFIGURE 1.2 (a) Wilhelm Wundt is credited as one of the founders of psychology. He created the first laboratory for\\npsychological research. (b) This photo shows him seated and surrounded by fellow researchers and equipment in\\nhis laboratory in Germany.\\nHowever, despite his efforts to train individuals in the process of introspection, this process remained highly\\nsubjective, and there was very little agreement between individuals.\\nFunctionalism\\nWilliam James, John Dewey, and Charles Sanders Peirce helped establish functional psychology (Figure 1.3).\\nThey accepted Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection and viewed this theory as an explanation of an\\norganism’s characteristics. Key to that theory is the idea that natural selection leads to organisms that are\\nadapted to their environment, including their behavior. Adaptation means that a trait of an organism has a\\nfunction for the survival and reproduction of the individual, because it has been naturally selected. As James\\nsaw it, psychology’s purpose was to study the function of behavior in the world, and as such, his perspective\\nwas known as functionalism. Functionalism focused on how mental activities helped an organism fit into its\\nenvironment. Functionalism has a second, more subtle meaning in that functionalists were more interested in\\nthe operation of the whole mind rather than of its individual parts, which were the focus of structuralism. Like\\nWundt, James believed that introspection could serve as one means by which someone might study mental\\nactivities, but James also relied on more objective measures, including the use of various recording devices,\\nand examinations of concrete products of mental activities and of anatomy and physiology (Gordon, 1995).\\n10 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\n', 'answer': \"Answer VERY concisely from the provided context only.

And what is the connection between the brain’s internal\\nprocesses and people’s external behaviors?

What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology\\nexplores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists\\nuse the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question\\nabout how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the\\nphenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or\\ngroup of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over\\ntime. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes\\nobservations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then\\npublished or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.\\nScientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because\\nit is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We\\nmust ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However,\\nwe can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus,\\npsychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.\\nIn general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot\\narrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the\\nmind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific\\nmethod is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on\\nobservation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or\\nprevious authorities.\\nIt was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this\\ntime, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is,\\nat its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological\\norganism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore,\\npsychology is also a social science.\\nWHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?\\nOften, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to\\nlearn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course\\nbecause it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as\\nnursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare\\npsychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses\\nacross the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology\\nmajors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook’s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality\\nand political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About\\n6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S.\\nDepartment of Education, 2016).\\n8 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nAn education in psychology is valuable for a number of reasons. Psychology students hone critical thinking\\nskills and are trained in the use of the scientific method. Critical thinking is the active application of a set of\\nskills to information for the understanding and evaluation of that information. The evaluation of\\ninformation—assessing its reliability and usefulness— is an important skill in a world full of competing “facts,”\\nmany of which are designed to be misleading. For example, critical thinking involves maintaining an attitude\\nof skepticism, recognizing internal biases, making use of logical thinking, asking appropriate questions, and\\nmaking observations. Psychology students also can develop better communication skills during the course of\\ntheir undergraduate coursework (American Psychological Association, 2011). Together, these factors increase\\nstudents’ scientific literacy and prepare students to critically evaluate the various sources of information they\\nencounter.\\nIn addition to these broad-based skills, psychology students come to understand the complex factors that\\nshape one’s behavior. They appreciate the interaction of our biology, our environment, and our experiences in\\ndetermining who we are and how we will behave. They learn about basic principles that guide how we think\\nand behave, and they come to recognize the tremendous diversity that exists across individuals and across\\ncultural boundaries (American Psychological Association, 2011).\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nWatch a brief video about some questions to consider before deciding to major in psychology\\n(http://openstax.org/l/psycmajor) to learn more.\\n1.2 History of Psychology\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Understand the importance of Wundt and James in the development of psychology\\n• Appreciate Freud’s influence on psychology\\n• Understand the basic tenets of Gestalt psychology\\n• Appreciate the important role that behaviorism played in psychology’s history\\n• Understand basic tenets of humanism\\n• Understand how the cognitive revolution shifted psychology’s focus back to the mind\\nPsychology is a relatively young science with its experimental roots in the 19th century, compared, for\\nexample, to human physiology, which dates much earlier. As mentioned, anyone interested in exploring issues\\nrelated to the mind generally did so in a philosophical context prior to the 19th century. Two 19th century\\nscholars, Wilhelm Wundt and William James, are generally credited as being the founders of psychology as a\\nscience and academic discipline that was distinct from philosophy. This section will provide an overview of the\\nshifts in paradigms that have influenced psychology from Wundt and James through today.\\nWundt and Structuralism\\nWilhelm Wundt (1832–1920) was a German scientist who was the first person to be referred to as a\\npsychologist. His famous book entitled Principles of Physiological Psychology was published in 1873. Wundt\\nviewed psychology as a scientific study of conscious experience, and he believed that the goal of psychology\\nwas to identify components of consciousness and how those components combined to result in our conscious\\nexperience. Wundt used introspection (he called it “internal perception”), a process by which someone\\nexamines their own conscious experience as objectively as possible, making the human mind like any other\\naspect of nature that a scientist observed. He believed in the notion of voluntarism—that people have free will\\nand should know the intentions of a psychological experiment if they were participating (Danziger, 1980).\\nWundt considered his version experimental introspection; he used instruments such as those that measured\\nreaction time. He also wrote Volkerpsychologie in 1904 in which he suggested that psychology should include\\nthe study of culture, as it involves the study of people. Edward Titchener, one of his students, went on to\\n1.2 • History of Psychology 9\\ndevelop structuralism. Its focus was on the contents of mental processes rather than their function (Pickren &\\nRutherford, 2010). Wundt established his psychology laboratory at the University at Leipzig in 1879 (Figure\\n1.2). In this laboratory, Wundt and his students conducted experiments on, for example, reaction times. A\\nsubject, sometimes in a room isolated from the scientist, would receive a stimulus such as a light, image, or\\nsound. The subject’s reaction to the stimulus would be to push a button, and an apparatus would record the\\ntime to reaction. Wundt could measure reaction time to one-thousandth of a second (Nicolas & Ferrand, 1999).\\nFIGURE 1.2 (a) Wilhelm Wundt is credited as one of the founders of psychology. He created the first laboratory for\\npsychological research. (b) This photo shows him seated and surrounded by fellow researchers and equipment in\\nhis laboratory in Germany.\\nHowever, despite his efforts to train individuals in the process of introspection, this process remained highly\\nsubjective, and there was very little agreement between individuals.\\nFunctionalism\\nWilliam James, John Dewey, and Charles Sanders Peirce helped establish functional psychology (Figure 1.3).\\nThey accepted Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection and viewed this theory as an explanation of an\\norganism’s characteristics. Key to that theory is the idea that natural selection leads to organisms that are\\nadapted to their environment, including their behavior. Adaptation means that a trait of an organism has a\\nfunction for the survival and reproduction of the individual, because it has been naturally selected. As James\\nsaw it, psychology’s purpose was to study the function of behavior in the world, and as such, his perspective\\nwas known as functionalism. Functionalism focused on how mental activities helped an organism fit into its\\nenvironment. Functionalism has a second, more subtle meaning in that functionalists were more interested in\\nthe operation of the whole mind rather than of its individual parts, which were the focus of structuralism. Like\\nWundt, James believed that introspection could serve as one means by which someone might study mental\\nactivities, but James also relied on more objective measures, including the use of various recording devices,\\nand examinations of concrete products of mental activities and of anatomy and physiology (Gordon, 1995).\\n10 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nFIGURE 1.3 William James, shown here in a self-portrait, was the first American psychologist.\\nFreud and Psychoanalytic Theory\\nPerhaps one of the most influential and well-known figures in psychology’s history was Sigmund Freud (Figure\\n1.4). Freud (1856–1939) was an Austrian neurologist who was fascinated by patients suffering from “hysteria”\\nand neurosis. Hysteria was an ancient diagnosis for disorders, primarily of women with a wide variety of\\nsymptoms, including physical symptoms and emotional disturbances, none of which had an apparent physical\\ncause. Freud theorized that many of his patients’ problems arose from the unconscious mind. In Freud’s view,\\nthe unconscious mind was a repository of feelings and urges of which we have no awareness. Gaining access to\\nthe unconscious, then, was crucial to the successful resolution of the patient’s problems. According to Freud,\\nthe unconscious mind could be accessed through dream analysis, by examinations of the first words that came\\nto people’s minds, and through seemingly innocent slips of the tongue. Psychoanalytic theory focuses on the\\nrole of a person’s unconscious, as well as early childhood experiences, and this particular perspective\\ndominated clinical psychology for several decades (Thorne & Henley, 2005).\\nFIGURE 1.4 (a) Sigmund Freud was a highly influential figure in the history of psychology. (b) One of his many\\nbooks, A General Introduction to Psychoanalysis, shared his ideas about psychoanalytical therapy; it was published\\nin 1922.\\nFreud’s ideas were influential, and you will learn more about them when you study lifespan development,\\npersonality, and therapy. For instance, many therapists believe strongly in the unconscious and the impact of\\n1.2 • History of Psychology 11\\nearly childhood experiences on the rest of a person’s life. The method of psychoanalysis, which involves the\\npatient talking about their experiences and selves, while not invented by Freud, was certainly popularized by\\nhim and is still used today. Many of Freud’s other ideas, however, are controversial. Drew Westen (1998) argues\\nthat many of the criticisms of Freud’s ideas are misplaced, in that they attack his older ideas without taking\\ninto account later writings. Westen also argues that critics fail to consider the success of the broad ideas that\\nFreud introduced or developed, such as the importance of childhood experiences in adult motivations, the role\\nof unconscious versus conscious motivations in driving our behavior, the fact that motivations can cause\\nconflicts that affect behavior, the effects of mental representations of ourselves and others in guiding our\\ninteractions, and the development of personality over time. Westen identifies subsequent research support for\\nall of these ideas.\\nMore modern iterations of Freud’s clinical approach have been empirically demonstrated to be effective (Knekt\\net al., 2008; Shedler, 2010). Some current practices in psychotherapy involve examining unconscious aspects\\nof the self and relationships, often through the relationship between the therapist and the client. Freud’s\\nhistorical significance and contributions to clinical practice merit his inclusion in a discussion of the historical\\nmovements within psychology.\\nWertheimer, Koffka, Köhler, and Gestalt Psychology\\nMax Wertheimer (1880–1943), Kurt Koffka (1886–1941), and Wolfgang Köhler (1887–1967) were three\\nGerman psychologists who immigrated to the United States in the early 20th century to escape Nazi Germany.\\nThese scholars are credited with introducing psychologists in the United States to various Gestalt principles.\\nThe word Gestalt roughly translates to “whole;” a major emphasis of Gestalt psychology deals with the fact that\\nalthough a sensory experience can be broken down into individual parts, how those parts relate to each other\\nas a whole is often what the individual responds to in perception. For example, a song may be made up of\\nindividual notes played by different instruments, but the real nature of the song is perceived in the\\ncombinations of these notes as they form the melody, rhythm, and harmony. In many ways, this particular\\nperspective would have directly contradicted Wundt’s ideas of structuralism (Thorne & Henley, 2005).\\nUnfortunately, in moving to the United States, these scientists were forced to abandon much of their work and\\nwere unable to continue to conduct research on a large scale. These factors along with the rise of behaviorism\\n(described next) in the United States prevented principles of Gestalt psychology from being as influential in\\nthe United States as they had been in their native Germany (Thorne & Henley, 2005). Despite these issues,\\nseveral Gestalt principles are still very influential today. Considering the human individual as a whole rather\\nthan as a sum of individually measured parts became an important foundation in humanistic theory late in the\\ncentury. The ideas of Gestalt have continued to influence research on sensation and perception.\\nStructuralism, Freud, and the Gestalt psychologists were all concerned in one way or another with describing\\nand understanding inner experience. But other researchers had concerns that inner experience could be a\\nlegitimate subject of scientific inquiry and chose instead to exclusively study behavior, the objectively\\nobservable outcome of mental processes.\\nPavlov, Watson, Skinner, and Behaviorism\\nEarly work in the field of behavior was conducted by the Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov (1849–1936). Pavlov\\nstudied a form of learning behavior called a conditioned reflex, in which an animal or human produced a\\nreflex (unconscious) response to a stimulus and, over time, was conditioned to produce the response to a\\ndifferent stimulus that the experimenter associated with the original stimulus. The reflex Pavlov worked with\\nwas salivation in response to the presence of food. The salivation reflex could be elicited using a second\\nstimulus, such as a specific sound, that was presented in association with the initial food stimulus several\\ntimes. Once the response to the second stimulus was “learned,” the food stimulus could be omitted. Pavlov’s\\n“classical conditioning” is only one form of learning behavior studied by behaviorists.\\nJohn B. Watson (1878–1958) was an influential American psychologist whose most famous work occurred\\n12 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nFIGURE 11.1 What makes two individuals have different personalities?

Two brothers, raised by the same\\n11Personality\\npeople, took radically different paths in their lives. Why did they make the choices they did? What internal\\nforces shaped their decisions? Personality psychology can help us answer these questions and more.\\n11.1 What Is Personality?\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Define personality\\n• Describe early theories about personality development\\nPersonality refers to the long-standing traits and patterns that propel individuals to consistently think, feel,\\nand behave in specific ways. Our personality is what makes us unique individuals. Each person has an\\nidiosyncratic pattern of enduring, long-term characteristics and a manner in which they interact with other\\nindividuals and the world around them. Our personalities are thought to be long term, stable, and not easily\\nchanged. The word personality comes from the Latin word persona. In the ancient world, a persona was a\\nmask worn by an actor. While we tend to think of a mask as being worn to conceal one’s identity, the theatrical\\nmask was originally used to either represent or project a specific personality trait of a character (Figure 11.2).\\nFIGURE 11.2 Happy, sad, impatient, shy, fearful, curious, helpful. What characteristics describe your personality?\\nHistorical Perspectives\\nThe concept of personality has been studied for at least 2,000 years, beginning with Hippocrates in 370 BCE\\n(Fazeli, 2012). Hippocrates theorized that personality traits and human behaviors are based on four separate\\ntemperaments associated with four fluids (“humors”) of the body: choleric temperament (yellow bile from the\\nliver), melancholic temperament (black bile from the kidneys), sanguine temperament (red blood from the\\nheart), and phlegmatic temperament (white phlegm from the lungs) (Clark & Watson, 2008; Eysenck &\\nEysenck, 1985; Lecci & Magnavita, 2013; Noga, 2007). Centuries later, the influential Greek physician and\\nphilosopher Galen built on Hippocrates’s theory, suggesting that both diseases and personality differences\\ncould be explained by imbalances in the humors and that each person exhibits one of the four temperaments.\\nFor example, the choleric person is passionate, ambitious, and bold; the melancholic person is reserved,\\nanxious, and unhappy; the sanguine person is joyful, eager, and optimistic; and the phlegmatic person is calm,\\nreliable, and thoughtful (Clark & Watson, 2008; Stelmack & Stalikas, 1991). Galen’s theory was prevalent for\\nover 1,000 years and continued to be popular through the Middle Ages.\\nIn 1780, Franz Gall, a German physician, proposed that the distances between bumps on the skull reveal a\\nperson’s personality traits, character, and mental abilities (Figure 11.3). According to Gall, measuring these\\ndistances revealed the sizes of the brain areas underneath, providing information that could be used to\\ndetermine whether a person was friendly, prideful, murderous, kind, good with languages, and so on. Initially,\\nphrenology was very popular; however, it was soon discredited for lack of empirical support and has long been\\nrelegated to the status of pseudoscience (Fancher, 1979).\\n360 11 • Personality\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nFIGURE 11.3 The pseudoscience of measuring the areas of a person’s skull is known as phrenology. (a) Gall\\ndeveloped a chart that depicted which areas of the skull corresponded to particular personality traits or\\ncharacteristics (Hothersall, 1995). (b) An 1825 lithograph depicts Gall examining the skull of a young woman. (credit\\nb: modification of work by Wellcome Library, London)\\nIn the centuries after Galen, other researchers contributed to the development of his four primary\\ntemperament types, most prominently Immanuel Kant (in the 18th century) and psychologist Wilhelm Wundt\\n(in the 19th century) (Eysenck, 2009; Stelmack & Stalikas, 1991; Wundt, 1874/1886) (Figure 11.4). Kant agreed\\nwith Galen that everyone could be sorted into one of the four temperaments and that there was no overlap\\nbetween the four categories (Eysenck, 2009). He developed a list of traits that could be used to describe the\\npersonality of a person from each of the four temperaments. However, Wundt suggested that a better\\ndescription of personality could be achieved using two major axes: emotional/nonemotional and changeable/\\nunchangeable. The first axis separated strong from weak emotions (the melancholic and choleric\\ntemperaments from the phlegmatic and sanguine). The second axis divided the changeable temperaments\\n(choleric and sanguine) from the unchangeable ones (melancholic and phlegmatic) (Eysenck, 2009).\\n11.1 • What Is Personality? 361\\nFIGURE 11.4 Developed from Galen’s theory of the four temperaments, Kant proposed trait words to describe each\\ntemperament. Wundt later suggested the arrangement of the traits on two major axes.\\nSigmund Freud’s psychodynamic perspective of personality was the first comprehensive theory of personality,\\nexplaining a wide variety of both normal and abnormal behaviors. According to Freud, unconscious drives\\ninfluenced by sex and aggression, along with childhood sexuality, are the forces that influence our personality.\\nFreud attracted many followers who modified his ideas to create new theories about personality. These\\ntheorists, referred to as neo-Freudians, generally agreed with Freud that childhood experiences matter, but\\nthey reduced the emphasis on sex and focused more on the social environment and effects of culture on\\npersonality. The perspective of personality proposed by Freud and his followers was the dominant theory of\\npersonality for the first half of the 20th century.\\nOther major theories then emerged, including the learning, humanistic, biological, evolutionary, trait, and\\ncultural perspectives. In this chapter, we will explore these various perspectives on personality in depth.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nView this video of an overview of some of the psychological perspectives on personality (http://openstax.org/l/\\nmandela) to learn more.\\n11.2 Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Describe the assumptions of the psychodynamic perspective on personality development\\n• Define and describe the nature and function of the id, ego, and superego\\n• Define and describe the defense mechanisms\\n• Define and describe the psychosexual stages of personality development\\nSigmund Freud (1856–1939) is probably the most controversial and misunderstood psychological theorist.\\nWhen reading Freud’s theories, it is important to remember that he was a medical doctor, not a psychologist.\\nThere was no such thing as a degree in psychology at the time that he received his education, which can help\\n362 11 • Personality\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nus understand some of the controversy over his theories today. However, Freud was the first to systematically\\nstudy and theorize the workings of the unconscious mind in the manner that we associate with modern\\npsychology.\\nIn the early years of his career, Freud worked with Josef Breuer, a Viennese physician. During this time, Freud\\nbecame intrigued by the story of one of Breuer’s patients, Bertha Pappenheim, who was referred to by the\\npseudonym Anna O. (Launer, 2005). Anna O. had been caring for her dying father when she began to\\nexperience symptoms such as partial paralysis, headaches, blurred vision, amnesia, and hallucinations\\n(Launer, 2005). In Freud’s day, these symptoms were commonly referred to as hysteria. Anna O. turned to\\nBreuer for help. He spent 2 years (1880–1882) treating Anna O. and discovered that allowing her to talk about\\nher experiences seemed to bring some relief of her symptoms. Anna O. called his treatment the “talking cure”\\n(Launer, 2005). Despite the fact that Freud never met Anna O., her story served as the basis for the 1895 book,\\nStudies on Hysteria, which he co-authored with Breuer. Based on Breuer’s description of Anna O.’s treatment,\\nFreud concluded that hysteria was the result of sexual abuse in childhood and that these traumatic\\nexperiences had been hidden from consciousness. Breuer disagreed with Freud, which soon ended their work\\ntogether. However, Freud continued to work to refine talk therapy and build his theory on personality.\\nLevels of Consciousness\\nTo explain the concept of conscious versus unconscious experience, Freud compared the mind to an iceberg\\n(Figure 11.5). He said that only about one-tenth of our mind is conscious, and the rest of our mind is\\nunconscious. Our unconscious refers to that mental activity of which we are unaware and are unable to access\\n(Freud, 1923). According to Freud, unacceptable urges and desires are kept in our unconscious through a\\nprocess called repression. For example, we sometimes say things that we don’t intend to say by unintentionally\\nsubstituting another word for the one we meant. You’ve probably heard of a Freudian slip, the term used to\\ndescribe this. Freud suggested that slips of the tongue are actually sexual or aggressive urges, accidentally\\nslipping out of our unconscious. Speech errors such as this are quite common. Seeing them as a reflection of\\nunconscious desires, linguists today have found that slips of the tongue tend to occur when we are tired,\\nnervous, or not at our optimal level of cognitive functioning (Motley, 2002).\\nFIGURE 11.5 Freud believed that we are only aware of a small amount of our mind’s activities and that most of it\\n11.2 • Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective 363\\n', 'answer': 'Answer VERY concisely from the provided context only.

This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of psychology has explored these questions. 1.1 What Is Psychology? LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you should be able to: • Define psychology • Describe the history of psychology and its current state of development The word psychology comes from two Greek words that mean “to think” and “mind.” The word is derived from the Greek word “psyche,” which means the mind or the soul, and the suffix “-logia,” meaning “study.” Psychology, then, refers to the science that studies the mental processes and behaviors of humans and other animals. In other words, psychologists study how people think, feel, learn, remember, think about themselves, think about the world around them, make decisions, solve problems, interact with others, etc. Psychologists also study mental disorders, such as depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and eating disorders. Psychologists use a variety of methods to study human behavior, including interviews, questionnaires, brain imaging, laboratory experiments, case studies, surveys, observation, self-report measures, clinical interviews, and more. These methods can be used in conjunction with one another to gather information about human behaviors. For example, a psychologist might use an interview to collect data about a person’s thoughts and feelings, but then use brain imaging to see how those thoughts are stored in the part of their brain called the hippocampus, which is involved in memory and decision-making. The psychologist can then compare the two types of data to determine whether or not the person has a mental disorder. There are many different subfields within psychology, each of which focuses on a particular type of behavior or mental process. Some of these sub-fields include the following: (1) developmental psychology; (2) neuropsychology; (3) psychopathology; and (4) social psychology. Developmental psychology is concerned with how children develop and change over time. This subfield focuses on the ways in which children learn and grow, as well as the factors that influence their development. Neuropsychologists are interested in how the nervous system works and how it is affected by disease or injury. They also study the relationship between brain structure and function. Finally, social psychologists focus on how human behavior is influenced by social and cultural factors. Social psychology studies how individuals and groups interact with each other and with their environment. It also looks at how these interactions affect individuals’ thoughts, feelings, beliefs, values, attitudes, behaviors, emotions, motivations', 'references': '{\"sections\": [\"Introduction to Psychology/Contemporary Psychology\", \"Personality/Learning Approaches\"], \"pages\": [\"21\", \"22\", \"373\"]}'}\n",

To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question\\nabout how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the\\nphenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or\\ngroup of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over\\ntime. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes\\nobservations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then\\npublished or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.\\nScientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because\\nit is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We\\nmust ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However,\\nwe can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus,\\npsychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.\\nIn general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot\\narrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the\\nmind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific\\nmethod is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on\\nobservation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or\\nprevious authorities.\\nIt was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this\\ntime, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is,\\nat its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological\\norganism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore,\\npsychology is also a social science.\\nWHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?\\nOften, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to\\nlearn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course\\nbecause it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as\\nnursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare\\npsychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses\\nacross the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology\\nmajors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook’s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality\\nand political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About\\n6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S.\\nDepartment of Education, 2016).\\n8 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nAn education in psychology is valuable for a number of reasons. Psychology students hone critical thinking\\nskills and are trained in the use of the scientific method. Critical thinking is the active application of a set of\\nskills to information for the understanding and evaluation of that information. The evaluation of\\ninformation—assessing its reliability and usefulness— is an important skill in a world full of competing “facts,”\\nmany of which are designed to be misleading. For example, critical thinking involves maintaining an attitude\\nof skepticism, recognizing internal biases, making use of logical thinking, asking appropriate questions, and\\nmaking observations. Psychology students also can develop better communication skills during the course of\\ntheir undergraduate coursework (American Psychological Association, 2011). Together, these factors increase\\nstudents’ scientific literacy and prepare students to critically evaluate the various sources of information they\\nencounter.\\nIn addition to these broad-based skills, psychology students come to understand the complex factors that\\nshape one’s behavior. They appreciate the interaction of our biology, our environment, and our experiences in\\ndetermining who we are and how we will behave. They learn about basic principles that guide how we think\\nand behave, and they come to recognize the tremendous diversity that exists across individuals and across\\ncultural boundaries (American Psychological Association, 2011).\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nWatch a brief video about some questions to consider before deciding to major in psychology\\n(http://openstax.org/l/psycmajor) to learn more.\\n1.2 History of Psychology\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Understand the importance of Wundt and James in the development of psychology\\n• Appreciate Freud’s influence on psychology\\n• Understand the basic tenets of Gestalt psychology\\n• Appreciate the important role that behaviorism played in psychology’s history\\n• Understand basic tenets of humanism\\n• Understand how the cognitive revolution shifted psychology’s focus back to the mind\\nPsychology is a relatively young science with its experimental roots in the 19th century, compared, for\\nexample, to human physiology, which dates much earlier. As mentioned, anyone interested in exploring issues\\nrelated to the mind generally did so in a philosophical context prior to the 19th century. Two 19th century\\nscholars, Wilhelm Wundt and William James, are generally credited as being the founders of psychology as a\\nscience and academic discipline that was distinct from philosophy. This section will provide an overview of the\\nshifts in paradigms that have influenced psychology from Wundt and James through today.\\nWundt and Structuralism\\nWilhelm Wundt (1832–1920) was a German scientist who was the first person to be referred to as a\\npsychologist. His famous book entitled Principles of Physiological Psychology was published in 1873. Wundt\\nviewed psychology as a scientific study of conscious experience, and he believed that the goal of psychology\\nwas to identify components of consciousness and how those components combined to result in our conscious\\nexperience. Wundt used introspection (he called it “internal perception”), a process by which someone\\nexamines their own conscious experience as objectively as possible, making the human mind like any other\\naspect of nature that a scientist observed. He believed in the notion of voluntarism—that people have free will\\nand should know the intentions of a psychological experiment if they were participating (Danziger, 1980).\\nWundt considered his version experimental introspection; he used instruments such as those that measured\\nreaction time. He also wrote Volkerpsychologie in 1904 in which he suggested that psychology should include\\nthe study of culture, as it involves the study of people. Edward Titchener, one of his students, went on to\\n1.2 • History of Psychology 9\\ndevelop structuralism. Its focus was on the contents of mental processes rather than their function (Pickren &\\nRutherford, 2010). Wundt established his psychology laboratory at the University at Leipzig in 1879 (Figure\\n1.2). In this laboratory, Wundt and his students conducted experiments on, for example, reaction times. A\\nsubject, sometimes in a room isolated from the scientist, would receive a stimulus such as a light, image, or\\nsound. The subject’s reaction to the stimulus would be to push a button, and an apparatus would record the\\ntime to reaction. Wundt could measure reaction time to one-thousandth of a second (Nicolas & Ferrand, 1999).\\nFIGURE 1.2 (a) Wilhelm Wundt is credited as one of the founders of psychology. He created the first laboratory for\\npsychological research. (b) This photo shows him seated and surrounded by fellow researchers and equipment in\\nhis laboratory in Germany.\\nHowever, despite his efforts to train individuals in the process of introspection, this process remained highly\\nsubjective, and there was very little agreement between individuals.\\nFunctionalism\\nWilliam James, John Dewey, and Charles Sanders Peirce helped establish functional psychology (Figure 1.3).\\nThey accepted Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection and viewed this theory as an explanation of an\\norganism’s characteristics. Key to that theory is the idea that natural selection leads to organisms that are\\nadapted to their environment, including their behavior. Adaptation means that a trait of an organism has a\\nfunction for the survival and reproduction of the individual, because it has been naturally selected. As James\\nsaw it, psychology’s purpose was to study the function of behavior in the world, and as such, his perspective\\nwas known as functionalism. Functionalism focused on how mental activities helped an organism fit into its\\nenvironment. Functionalism has a second, more subtle meaning in that functionalists were more interested in\\nthe operation of the whole mind rather than of its individual parts, which were the focus of structuralism. Like\\nWundt, James believed that introspection could serve as one means by which someone might study mental\\nactivities, but James also relied on more objective measures, including the use of various recording devices,\\nand examinations of concrete products of mental activities and of anatomy and physiology (Gordon, 1995).\\n10 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nFIGURE 1.3 William James, shown here in a self-portrait, was the first American psychologist.\\nFreud and Psychoanalytic Theory\\nPerhaps one of the most influential and well-known figures in psychology’s history was Sigmund Freud (Figure\\n1.4). Freud (1856–1939) was an Austrian neurologist who was fascinated by patients suffering from “hysteria”\\nand neurosis. Hysteria was an ancient diagnosis for disorders, primarily of women with a wide variety of\\nsymptoms, including physical symptoms and emotional disturbances, none of which had an apparent physical\\ncause. Freud theorized that many of his patients’ problems arose from the unconscious mind. In Freud’s view,\\nthe unconscious mind was a repository of feelings and urges of which we have no awareness. Gaining access to\\nthe unconscious, then, was crucial to the successful resolution of the patient’s problems. According to Freud,\\nthe unconscious mind could be accessed through dream analysis, by examinations of the first words that came\\nto people’s minds, and through seemingly innocent slips of the tongue. Psychoanalytic theory focuses on the\\nrole of a person’s unconscious, as well as early childhood experiences, and this particular perspective\\ndominated clinical psychology for several decades (Thorne & Henley, 2005).\\nFIGURE 1.4 (a) Sigmund Freud was a highly influential figure in the history of psychology. (b) One of his many\\nbooks, A General Introduction to Psychoanalysis, shared his ideas about psychoanalytical therapy; it was published\\nin 1922.\\nFreud’s ideas were influential, and you will learn more about them when you study lifespan development,\\npersonality, and therapy. For instance, many therapists believe strongly in the unconscious and the impact of\\n1.2 • History of Psychology 11\\nearly childhood experiences on the rest of a person’s life. The method of psychoanalysis, which involves the\\npatient talking about their experiences and selves, while not invented by Freud, was certainly popularized by\\nhim and is still used today. Many of Freud’s other ideas, however, are controversial. Drew Westen (1998) argues\\nthat many of the criticisms of Freud’s ideas are misplaced, in that they attack his older ideas without taking\\ninto account later writings. Westen also argues that critics fail to consider the success of the broad ideas that\\nFreud introduced or developed, such as the importance of childhood experiences in adult motivations, the role\\nof unconscious versus conscious motivations in driving our behavior, the fact that motivations can cause\\nconflicts that affect behavior, the effects of mental representations of ourselves and others in guiding our\\ninteractions, and the development of personality over time. Westen identifies subsequent research support for\\nall of these ideas.\\nMore modern iterations of Freud’s clinical approach have been empirically demonstrated to be effective (Knekt\\net al., 2008; Shedler, 2010). Some current practices in psychotherapy involve examining unconscious aspects\\nof the self and relationships, often through the relationship between the therapist and the client. Freud’s\\nhistorical significance and contributions to clinical practice merit his inclusion in a discussion of the historical\\nmovements within psychology.\\nWertheimer, Koffka, Köhler, and Gestalt Psychology\\nMax Wertheimer (1880–1943), Kurt Koffka (1886–1941), and Wolfgang Köhler (1887–1967) were three\\nGerman psychologists who immigrated to the United States in the early 20th century to escape Nazi Germany.\\nThese scholars are credited with introducing psychologists in the United States to various Gestalt principles.\\nThe word Gestalt roughly translates to “whole;” a major emphasis of Gestalt psychology deals with the fact that\\nalthough a sensory experience can be broken down into individual parts, how those parts relate to each other\\nas a whole is often what the individual responds to in perception. For example, a song may be made up of\\nindividual notes played by different instruments, but the real nature of the song is perceived in the\\ncombinations of these notes as they form the melody, rhythm, and harmony. In many ways, this particular\\nperspective would have directly contradicted Wundt’s ideas of structuralism (Thorne & Henley, 2005).\\nUnfortunately, in moving to the United States, these scientists were forced to abandon much of their work and\\nwere unable to continue to conduct research on a large scale. These factors along with the rise of behaviorism\\n(described next) in the United States prevented principles of Gestalt psychology from being as influential in\\nthe United States as they had been in their native Germany (Thorne & Henley, 2005). Despite these issues,\\nseveral Gestalt principles are still very influential today. Considering the human individual as a whole rather\\nthan as a sum of individually measured parts became an important foundation in humanistic theory late in the\\ncentury. The ideas of Gestalt have continued to influence research on sensation and perception.\\nStructuralism, Freud, and the Gestalt psychologists were all concerned in one way or another with describing\\nand understanding inner experience. But other researchers had concerns that inner experience could be a\\nlegitimate subject of scientific inquiry and chose instead to exclusively study behavior, the objectively\\nobservable outcome of mental processes.\\nPavlov, Watson, Skinner, and Behaviorism\\nEarly work in the field of behavior was conducted by the Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov (1849–1936). Pavlov\\nstudied a form of learning behavior called a conditioned reflex, in which an animal or human produced a\\nreflex (unconscious) response to a stimulus and, over time, was conditioned to produce the response to a\\ndifferent stimulus that the experimenter associated with the original stimulus. The reflex Pavlov worked with\\nwas salivation in response to the presence of food. The salivation reflex could be elicited using a second\\nstimulus, such as a specific sound, that was presented in association with the initial food stimulus several\\ntimes. Once the response to the second stimulus was “learned,” the food stimulus could be omitted. Pavlov’s\\n“classical conditioning” is only one form of learning behavior studied by behaviorists.\\nJohn B. Watson (1878–1958) was an influential American psychologist whose most famous work occurred\\n12 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\n4-year institutions and use these opportunities to gain experience in teaching. Furthermore, many 2-year\\ncolleges and schools need faculty to teach their courses in psychology. In general, many of the people who\\npursue careers at these institutions have master’s degrees in psychology, although some PhDs make careers at\\nthese institutions as well.\\nSome people earning PhDs may enjoy research in an academic setting. However, they may not be interested in\\nteaching. These individuals might take on faculty positions that are exclusively devoted to conducting\\nresearch. This type of position would be more likely an option at large, research-focused universities.\\nIn some areas in psychology, it is common for individuals who have recently earned their PhD to seek out\\npositions in postdoctoral training programs that are available before going on to serve as faculty. In most\\ncases, young scientists will complete one or two postdoctoral programs before applying for a full-time faculty\\nposition. Postdoctoral training programs allow young scientists to further develop their research programs\\nand broaden their research skills under the supervision of other professionals in the field.\\nCareer Options Outside of Academic Settings\\nIndividuals who wish to become practicing clinical psychologists have another option for earning a doctoral\\ndegree, which is known as a PsyD. A PsyD is a doctor of psychology degree that is increasingly popular among\\nindividuals interested in pursuing careers in clinical psychology. PsyD programs generally place less emphasis\\non research-oriented skills and focus more on application of psychological principles in the clinical context\\n(Norcross & Castle, 2002).\\nRegardless of whether earning a PhD or PsyD, in most states, an individual wishing to practice as a licensed\\nclinical or counseling psychologist may complete postdoctoral work under the supervision of a licensed\\npsychologist. Within the last few years, however, several states have begun to remove this requirement, which\\nwould allow people to get an earlier start in their careers (Munsey, 2009). After an individual has met the state\\nrequirements, their credentials are evaluated to determine whether they can sit for the licensure exam. Only\\nindividuals that pass this exam can call themselves licensed clinical or counseling psychologists (Norcross,\\nn.d.). Licensed clinical or counseling psychologists can then work in a number of settings, ranging from private\\nclinical practice to hospital settings. It should be noted that clinical psychologists and psychiatrists do different\\nthings and receive different types of education. While both can conduct therapy and counseling, clinical\\npsychologists have a PhD or a PsyD, whereas psychiatrists have a doctor of medicine degree (MD). As such,\\nlicensed clinical psychologists can administer and interpret psychological tests, while psychiatrists can\\nprescribe medications.\\nIndividuals earning a PhD can work in a variety of settings, depending on their areas of specialization. For\\nexample, someone trained as a biopsychologist might work in a pharmaceutical company to help test the\\nefficacy of a new drug. Someone with a clinical background might become a forensic psychologist and work\\nwithin the legal system to make recommendations during criminal trials and parole hearings, or serve as an\\nexpert in a court case.\\nWhile earning a doctoral degree in psychology is a lengthy process, usually taking between 5–6 years of\\ngraduate study (DeAngelis, 2010), there are a number of careers that can be attained with a master’s degree in\\npsychology. People who wish to provide psychotherapy can become licensed to serve as various types of\\nprofessional counselors (Hoffman, 2012). Relevant master’s degrees are also sufficient for individuals seeking\\ncareers as school psychologists (National Association of School Psychologists, n.d.), in some capacities related\\nto sport psychology (American Psychological Association, 2014), or as consultants in various industrial\\nsettings (Landers, 2011, June 14). Undergraduate coursework in psychology may be applicable to other careers\\nsuch as psychiatric social work or psychiatric nursing, where assessments and therapy may be a part of the\\njob.\\nAs mentioned in the opening section of this chapter, an undergraduate education in psychology is associated\\nwith a knowledge base and skill set that many employers find quite attractive. It should come as no surprise,\\n28 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nthen, that individuals earning bachelor’s degrees in psychology find themselves in a number of different\\ncareers, as shown in Table 1.1. Examples of a few such careers can involve serving as case managers, working\\nin sales, working in human resource departments, and teaching in high schools. The rapidly growing realm of\\nhealthcare professions is another field in which an education in psychology is helpful and sometimes required.\\nFor example, the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) exam that people must take to be admitted to medical\\nschool now includes a section on the psychological foundations of behavior.\\nTop Occupations Employing Graduates with a BA in Psychology (Fogg, Harrington, Harrington, & Shatkin,\\n2012)\\nRanking Occupation\\n1 Mid- and top-level management (executive, administrator)\\n2 Sales\\n3 Social work\\n4 Other management positions\\n5 Human resources (personnel, training)\\n6 Other administrative positions\\n7 Insurance, real estate, business\\n8 Marketing and sales\\n9 Healthcare (nurse, pharmacist, therapist)\\n10 Finance (accountant, auditor)\\nTABLE 1.1\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nThe APA provides career information (http://openstax.org/l/careers) about various areas of psychology.\\n1.4 • Careers in Psychology 29\\nKey Terms\\nAmerican Psychological Association (APA) professional organization representing psychologists in the\\nUnited States\\nbehaviorism focus on observing and controlling behavior\\nbiopsychology study of how biology influences behavior\\nbiopsychosocial model perspective that asserts that biology, psychology, and social factors interact to\\ndetermine an individual’s health\\nclinical psychology area of psychology that focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of psychological disorders\\nand other problematic patterns of behavior\\ncognitive psychology study of cognitions, or thoughts, and their relationship to experiences and actions\\ncounseling psychology area of psychology that focuses on improving emotional, social, vocational, and other\\naspects of the lives of psychologically healthy individuals\\ndevelopmental psychology scientific study of development across a lifespan\\ndissertation long research paper about research that was conducted as a part of the candidate’s doctoral\\ntraining\\nempirical method method for acquiring knowledge based on observation, including experimentation, rather\\nthan a method based only on forms of logical argument or previous authorities\\nforensic psychology area of psychology that applies the science and practice of psychology to issues within\\nand related to the justice system\\nfunctionalism focused on how mental activities helped an organism adapt to its environment\\nhumanism perspective within psychology that emphasizes the potential for good that is innate to all humans\\nintrospection process by which someone examines their own conscious experience in an attempt to break it\\ninto its component parts\\nology suffix that denotes “scientific study of”\\npersonality psychology study of patterns of thoughts and behaviors that make each individual unique\\npersonality trait consistent pattern of thought and behavior\\nPhD (doctor of philosophy) doctoral degree conferred in many disciplinary perspectives housed in a\\ntraditional college of liberal arts and sciences\\npostdoctoral training program allows young scientists to further develop their research programs and\\nbroaden their research skills under the supervision of other professionals in the field\\npsychoanalytic theory focus on the role of the unconscious in affecting conscious behavior\\npsychology scientific study of the mind and behavior\\nPsyD (doctor of psychology) doctoral degree that places less emphasis on research-oriented skills and focuses\\nmore on application of psychological principles in the clinical context\\nsport and exercise psychology area of psychology that focuses on the interactions between mental and\\nemotional factors and physical performance in sports, exercise, and other activities\\nstructuralism understanding the conscious experience through introspection\\nSummary\\n1.1 What Is Psychology?\\nPsychology is defined as the scientific study of mind and behavior. Students of psychology develop critical\\nthinking skills, become familiar with the scientific method, and recognize the complexity of behavior.\\n1.2 History of Psychology\\nBefore the time of Wundt and James, questions about the mind were considered by philosophers. However,\\nboth Wundt and James helped create psychology as a distinct scientific discipline. Wundt was a structuralist,\\nwhich meant he believed that our cognitive experience was best understood by breaking that experience into\\nits component parts. He thought this was best accomplished by introspection.\\n30 1 • Key Terms\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nWilliam James was the first American psychologist, and he was a proponent of functionalism. This particular\\nperspective focused on how mental activities served as adaptive responses to an organism’s environment. Like\\nWundt, James also relied on introspection; however, his research approach also incorporated more objective\\nmeasures as well.\\nSigmund Freud believed that understanding the unconscious mind was absolutely critical to understand\\nconscious behavior. This was especially true for individuals that he saw who suffered from various hysterias\\nand neuroses. Freud relied on dream analysis, slips of the tongue, and free association as means to access the\\nunconscious. Psychoanalytic theory remained a dominant force in clinical psychology for several decades.\\nGestalt psychology was very influential in Europe. Gestalt psychology takes a holistic view of an individual and\\nhis experiences. As the Nazis came to power in Germany, Wertheimer, Koffka, and Köhler immigrated to the\\nUnited States. Although they left their laboratories and their research behind, they did introduce America to\\nGestalt ideas. Some of the principles of Gestalt psychology are still very influential in the study of sensation\\nand perception.\\nOne of the most influential schools of thought within psychology’s history was behaviorism. Behaviorism\\nfocused on making psychology an objective science by studying overt behavior and deemphasizing the\\nimportance of unobservable mental processes. John Watson is often considered the father of behaviorism, and\\nB. F. Skinner’s contributions to our understanding of principles of operant conditioning cannot be\\nunderestimated.\\nAs behaviorism and psychoanalytic theory took hold of so many aspects of psychology, some began to become\\ndissatisfied with psychology’s picture of human nature. Thus, a humanistic movement within psychology\\nbegan to take hold. Humanism focuses on the potential of all people for good. Both Maslow and Rogers were\\ninfluential in shaping humanistic psychology.\\nDuring the 1950s, the landscape of psychology began to change. A science of behavior began to shift back to its\\nroots of focus on mental processes. The emergence of neuroscience and computer science aided this\\ntransition. Ultimately, the cognitive revolution took hold, and people came to realize that cognition was crucial\\nto a true appreciation and understanding of behavior.\\n1.3 Contemporary Psychology\\nPsychology is a diverse discipline that is made up of several major subdivisions with unique perspectives.\\nBiological psychology involves the study of the biological bases of behavior. Sensation and perception refer to\\nthe area of psychology that is focused on how information from our sensory modalities is received, and how\\nthis information is transformed into our perceptual experiences of the world around us. Cognitive psychology\\nis concerned with the relationship that exists between thought and behavior, and developmental psychologists\\nstudy the physical and cognitive changes that occur throughout one’s lifespan. Personality psychology focuses\\non individuals’ unique patterns of behavior, thought, and emotion. Industrial and organizational psychology,\\nhealth psychology, sport and exercise psychology, forensic psychology, and clinical psychology are all\\nconsidered applied areas of psychology. Industrial and organizational psychologists apply psychological\\nconcepts to I-O settings. Health psychologists look for ways to help people live healthier lives, and clinical\\npsychology involves the diagnosis and treatment of psychological disorders and other problematic behavioral\\npatterns. Sport and exercise psychologists study the interactions between thoughts, emotions, and physical\\nperformance in sports, exercise, and other activities. Forensic psychologists carry out activities related to\\npsychology in association with the justice system.\\n1.4 Careers in Psychology\\nGenerally, academic careers in psychology require doctoral degrees. However, there are a number of\\nnonacademic career options for people who have master’s degrees in psychology. While people with bachelor’s\\ndegrees in psychology have more limited psychology-related career options, the skills acquired as a function of\\n1 • Summary 31\\nan undergraduate education in psychology are useful in a variety of work contexts.\\nReview Questions\\n1.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Define psychology • Understand the merits of an education in psychology What is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology explores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists use the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question about how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the phenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over time. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes observations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then published or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results. Scientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because it is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We must ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However, we can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus, psychological science is empirical, based on measurable data. In general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot arrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the mind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific method is also limited in that it can only be applied to observable, measurable phenomena. It cannot be used to study unobservable, unmeasurable phenomena, such as the thoughts and feelings of individuals. Psychology is different from other sciences in several ways. First, psychology is an empirical science. Second, it is a social science, because it deals with human behavior and social interactions. Third, psychologists study individuals, not groups of people. Fourth, psychological research is often conducted in a laboratory setting, in which the researcher controls all variables except for the one that he or she is interested in studying. Fifth, the results of psychological studies are often published in scientific journals. Sixth, there are many different fields within psychology, each with its own subfields and subdisciplines. Each of these fields is further divided into sub-fields, sub-sub-fields and so on, until there is no limit to how many levels of sub-divisions there are within a single field. Finally, although psychology has been around for a long time, its methods and approaches have changed dramatically over the past few decades, as new research techniques and theories have been developed and applied. In this textbook, we will focus on psychology as it is practiced today, but we will also look at the history and development of other fields within the discipline. 2.2 Theories of Human Behavior Theories are generalizations about how the world works. They are hypotheses that have been repeatedly tested and found to be true. There are two main types of theories: descriptive and explanatory. Descriptive theories describe how things work. Explanatory theories attempt to predict what will happen in the future. Both types of theories are important in understanding how people think and behave. A descriptive theory describes the behavior of one or more people in terms of what they do and how they do it. Examples of descriptive theories include Freud’s theory of psychosexual development and Piaget’s theory of cognitive development. An explanatory theory attempts to make predictions about future behavior based on what we already know about past behavior. There are a number of different ways in which psychologists can test theories. One way is to observe people in the real world and measure their behavior in order to see if the theory makes sense. Another way of testing theories is through the use of experiments. These are experiments that involve manipulating variables in an attempt to determine whether or not they have an effect on a particular outcome. If a variable is manipulated, it', 'references': '{\"sections\": [\"Introduction to Psychology/Contemporary Psychology\", \"Psychological Research/Approaches to Research\"], \"pages\": [\"22\", \"42\", \"44\"]}'}\n",
      "Response for query ID 14: {'context': \"Use of Research Information\\nTrying to determine which theories are and are not accepted by the scientific community can be difficult,\\nespecially in an area of research as broad as psychology. More than ever before, we have an incredible amount\\nof information at our fingertips, and a simple internet search on any given research topic might result in a\\nnumber of contradictory studies. In these cases, we are witnessing the scientific community going through the\\nprocess of reaching a consensus, and it could be quite some time before a consensus emerges. For example,\\nthe explosion in our use of technology has led researchers to question whether this ultimately helps or hinders\\nus. The use and implementation of technology in educational settings has become widespread over the last few\\ndecades. Researchers are coming to different conclusions regarding the use of technology. To illustrate this\\npoint, a study investigating a smartphone app targeting surgery residents (graduate students in surgery\\ntraining) found that the use of this app can increase student engagement and raise test scores (Shaw & Tan,\\n2015). Conversely, another study found that the use of technology in undergraduate student populations had\\nnegative impacts on sleep, communication, and time management skills (Massimini & Peterson, 2009). Until\\nsufficient amounts of research have been conducted, there will be no clear consensus on the effects that\\ntechnology has on a student's acquisition of knowledge, study skills, and mental health.\\nIn the meantime, we should strive to think critically about the information we encounter by exercising a degree\\nof healthy skepticism. When someone makes a claim, we should examine the claim from a number of different\\nperspectives: what is the expertise of the person making the claim, what might they gain if the claim is valid,\\ndoes the claim seem justified given the evidence, and what do other researchers think of the claim? This is\\nespecially important when we consider how much information in advertising campaigns and on the internet\\nclaims to be based on “scientific evidence” when in actuality it is a belief or perspective of just a few\\nindividuals trying to sell a product or draw attention to their perspectives.\\nWe should be informed consumers of the information made available to us because decisions based on this\\ninformation have significant consequences. One such consequence can be seen in politics and public policy.\\nImagine that you have been elected as the governor of your state. One of your responsibilities is to manage the\\nstate budget and determine how to best spend your constituents’ tax dollars. As the new governor, you need to\\ndecide whether to continue funding early intervention programs. These programs are designed to help\\nchildren who come from low-income backgrounds, have special needs, or face other disadvantages. These\\nprograms may involve providing a wide variety of services to maximize the children's development and\\nposition them for optimal levels of success in school and later in life (Blann, 2005). While such programs\\nsound appealing, you would want to be sure that they also proved effective before investing additional money\\nin these programs. Fortunately, psychologists and other scientists have conducted vast amounts of research on\\nsuch programs and, in general, the programs are found to be effective (Neil & Christensen, 2009; Peters-\\nScheffer, Didden, Korzilius, & Sturmey, 2011). While not all programs are equally effective, and the short-term\\neffects of many such programs are more pronounced, there is reason to believe that many of these programs\\nproduce long-term benefits for participants (Barnett, 2011). If you are committed to being a good steward of\\ntaxpayer money, you would want to look at research. Which programs are most effective? What characteristics\\nof these programs make them effective? Which programs promote the best outcomes? After examining the\\nresearch, you would be best equipped to make decisions about which programs to fund.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nWatch this video about early childhood program effectiveness (http://openstax.org/l/programeffect) to learn\\nhow scientists evaluate effectiveness and how best to invest money into programs that are most effective.\\nUltimately, it is not just politicians who can benefit from using research in guiding their decisions. We all might\\nlook to research from time to time when making decisions in our lives. Imagine you just found out that your\\nsister Maria's child, Umberto, was recently diagnosed with autism. There are many treatments for autism that\\nhelp decrease the negative impact of autism on the individual. Some examples of treatments for autism are\\n2.1 • Why Is Research Important? 37\\napplied behavior analysis (ABA), social communication groups, social skills groups, occupational therapy, and\\neven medication options. If Maria asked you for advice or guidance, what would you do? You would likely want\\nto review the research and learn about the efficacy of each treatment so you could best advise your sister.\\nIn the end, research is what makes the difference between facts and opinions. Facts are observable realities,\\nand opinions are personal judgments, conclusions, or attitudes that may or may not be accurate. In the\\nscientific community, facts can be established only using evidence collected through empirical research.\\nNOTABLE RESEARCHERS\\nPsychological research has a long history involving important figures from diverse backgrounds. While the\\nintroductory chapter discussed several researchers who made significant contributions to the discipline, there\\nare many more individuals who deserve attention in considering how psychology has advanced as a science\\nthrough their work (Figure 2.3). For instance, Margaret Floy Washburn (1871–1939) was the first woman to\\nearn a PhD in psychology. Her research focused on animal behavior and cognition (Margaret Floy Washburn,\\nPhD, n.d.). Mary Whiton Calkins (1863–1930) was a preeminent first-generation American psychologist who\\nopposed the behaviorist movement, conducted significant research into memory, and established one of the\\nearliest experimental psychology labs in the United States (Mary Whiton Calkins, n.d.).\\nFrancis Sumner (1895–1954) was the first African American to receive a PhD in psychology in 1920. His\\ndissertation focused on issues related to psychoanalysis. Sumner also had research interests in racial bias and\\neducational justice. Sumner was one of the founders of Howard University’s department of psychology, and\\nbecause of his accomplishments, he is sometimes referred to as the “Father of Black Psychology.” Thirteen\\nyears later, Inez Beverly Prosser (1895–1934) became the first African American woman to receive a PhD in\\npsychology. Prosser’s research highlighted issues related to education in segregated versus integrated schools,\\nand ultimately, her work was very influential in the hallmark Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court\\nruling that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional (Ethnicity and Health in America Series:\\nFeatured Psychologists, n.d.).\\nFIGURE 2.3 (a) Margaret Floy Washburn was the first woman to earn a doctorate degree in psychology. (b) The\\noutcome of Brown v. Board of Education was influenced by the research of psychologist Inez Beverly Prosser, who\\nwas the first African American woman to earn a PhD in psychology.\\nAlthough the establishment of psychology’s scientific roots occurred first in Europe and the United States, it\\ndid not take much time until researchers from around the world began to establish their own laboratories and\\nresearch programs. For example, some of the first experimental psychology laboratories in South America\\nwere founded by Horatio Piñero (1869–1919) at two institutions in Buenos Aires, Argentina (Godoy & Brussino,\\n2010). In India, Gunamudian David Boaz (1908–1965) and Narendra Nath Sen Gupta (1889–1944) established\\n38 2 • Psychological Research\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nthe first independent departments of psychology at the University of Madras and the University of Calcutta,\\nrespectively. These developments provided an opportunity for Indian researchers to make important\\ncontributions to the field (Gunamudian David Boaz, n.d.; Narendra Nath Sen Gupta, n.d.).\\nWhen the American Psychological Association (APA) was first founded in 1892, all of the members were White\\nmales (Women and Minorities in Psychology, n.d.). However, by 1905, Mary Whiton Calkins was elected as the\\nfirst female president of the APA, and by 1946, nearly one-quarter of American psychologists were female.\\nPsychology became a popular degree option for students enrolled in the nation’s historically Black higher\\neducation institutions, increasing the number of Black Americans who went on to become psychologists. Given\\ndemographic shifts occurring in the United States and increased access to higher educational opportunities\\namong historically underrepresented populations, there is reason to hope that the diversity of the field will\\nincreasingly match the larger population, and that the research contributions made by the psychologists of the\\nfuture will better serve people of all backgrounds (Women and Minorities in Psychology, n.d.).\\nThe Process of Scientific Research\\nScientific knowledge is advanced through a process known as the scientific method. Basically, ideas (in the\\nform of theories and hypotheses) are tested against the real world (in the form of empirical observations), and\\nthose empirical observations lead to more ideas that are tested against the real world, and so on. In this sense,\\nthe scientific process is circular. The types of reasoning within the circle are called deductive and inductive. In\\ndeductive reasoning, ideas are tested in the real world; in inductive reasoning, real-world observations lead\\nto new ideas (Figure 2.4). These processes are inseparable, like inhaling and exhaling, but different research\\napproaches place different emphasis on the deductive and inductive aspects.\\nFIGURE 2.4 Psychological research relies on both inductive and deductive reasoning.\\nIn the scientific context, deductive reasoning begins with a generalization—one hypothesis—that is then used\\nto reach logical conclusions about the real world. If the hypothesis is correct, then the logical conclusions\\nreached through deductive reasoning should also be correct. A deductive reasoning argument might go\\nsomething like this: All living things require energy to survive (this would be your hypothesis). Ducks are living\\nthings. Therefore, ducks require energy to survive (logical conclusion). In this example, the hypothesis is\\ncorrect; therefore, the conclusion is correct as well. Sometimes, however, an incorrect hypothesis may lead to a\\nlogical but incorrect conclusion. Consider this argument: all ducks are born with the ability to see. Quackers is\\na duck. Therefore, Quackers was born with the ability to see. Scientists use deductive reasoning to empirically\\ntest their hypotheses. Returning to the example of the ducks, researchers might design a study to test the\\nhypothesis that if all living things require energy to survive, then ducks will be found to require energy to\\nsurvive.\\nDeductive reasoning starts with a generalization that is tested against real-world observations; however,\\ninductive reasoning moves in the opposite direction. Inductive reasoning uses empirical observations to\\n2.1 • Why Is Research Important? 39\\nconstruct broad generalizations. Unlike deductive reasoning, conclusions drawn from inductive reasoning\\nmay or may not be correct, regardless of the observations on which they are based. For instance, you may\\nnotice that your favorite fruits—apples, bananas, and oranges—all grow on trees; therefore, you assume that all\\nfruit must grow on trees. This would be an example of inductive reasoning, and, clearly, the existence of\\nstrawberries, blueberries, and kiwi demonstrate that this generalization is not correct despite it being based\\non a number of direct observations. Scientists use inductive reasoning to formulate theories, which in turn\\ngenerate hypotheses that are tested with deductive reasoning. In the end, science involves both deductive and\\ninductive processes.\\nFor example, case studies, which you will read about in the next section, are heavily weighted on the side of\\nempirical observations. Thus, case studies are closely associated with inductive processes as researchers\\ngather massive amounts of observations and seek interesting patterns (new ideas) in the data. Experimental\\nresearch, on the other hand, puts great emphasis on deductive reasoning.\\nWe’ve stated that theories and hypotheses are ideas, but what sort of ideas are they, exactly? A theory is a well-\\ndeveloped set of ideas that propose an explanation for observed phenomena. Theories are repeatedly checked\\nagainst the world, but they tend to be too complex to be tested all at once; instead, researchers create\\nhypotheses to test specific aspects of a theory.\\nA hypothesis is a testable prediction about how the world will behave if our idea is correct, and it is often\\nworded as an if-then statement (e.g., if I study all night, I will get a passing grade on the test). The hypothesis is\\nextremely important because it bridges the gap between the realm of ideas and the real world. As specific\\nhypotheses are tested, theories are modified and refined to reflect and incorporate the result of these tests\\nFigure 2.5.\\nFIGURE 2.5 The scientific method involves deriving hypotheses from theories and then testing those hypotheses. If\\nthe results are consistent with the theory, then the theory is supported. If the results are not consistent, then the\\ntheory should be modified and new hypotheses will be generated.\\nTo see how this process works, let’s consider a specific theory and a hypothesis that might be generated from\\nthat theory. As you’ll learn in a later chapter, the James-Lange theory of emotion asserts that emotional\\nexperience relies on the physiological arousal associated with the emotional state. If you walked out of your\\nhome and discovered a very aggressive snake waiting on your doorstep, your heart would begin to race and\\nyour stomach churn. According to the James-Lange theory, these physiological changes would result in your\\n40 2 • Psychological Research\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nfeeling of fear. A hypothesis that could be derived from this theory might be that a person who is unaware of\\nthe physiological arousal that the sight of the snake elicits will not feel fear.\\nA scientific hypothesis is also falsifiable, or capable of being shown to be incorrect. Recall from the\\nintroductory chapter that Sigmund Freud had lots of interesting ideas to explain various human behaviors\\n(Figure 2.6). However, a major criticism of Freud’s theories is that many of his ideas are not falsifiable; for\\nexample, it is impossible to imagine empirical observations that would disprove the existence of the id, the\\nego, and the superego—the three elements of personality described in Freud’s theories. Despite this, Freud’s\\ntheories are widely taught in introductory psychology texts because of their historical significance for\\npersonality psychology and psychotherapy, and these remain the root of all modern forms of therapy.\\nFIGURE 2.6 Many of the specifics of (a) Freud's theories, such as (b) his division of the mind into id, ego, and\\nsuperego, have fallen out of favor in recent decades because they are not falsifiable. In broader strokes, his views\\nset the stage for much of psychological thinking today, such as the unconscious nature of the majority of\\npsychological processes.\\nIn contrast, the James-Lange theory does generate falsifiable hypotheses, such as the one described above.\\nSome individuals who suffer significant injuries to their spinal columns are unable to feel the bodily changes\\nthat often accompany emotional experiences. Therefore, we could test the hypothesis by determining how\\nemotional experiences differ between individuals who have the ability to detect these changes in their\\nphysiological arousal and those who do not. In fact, this research has been conducted and while the emotional\\nexperiences of people deprived of an awareness of their physiological arousal may be less intense, they still\\nexperience emotion (Chwalisz, Diener, & Gallagher, 1988).\\nScientific research’s dependence on falsifiability allows for great confidence in the information that it\\nproduces. Typically, by the time information is accepted by the scientific community, it has been tested\\nrepeatedly.\\n2.2 Approaches to Research\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Describe the different research methods used by psychologists\\n• Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of case studies, naturalistic observation, surveys, and archival research\\n• Compare longitudinal and cross-sectional approaches to research\\n• Compare and contrast correlation and causation\\nThere are many research methods available to psychologists in their efforts to understand, describe, and\\n2.2 • Approaches to Research 41\\nexplain behavior and the cognitive and biological processes that underlie it. Some methods rely on\\nobservational techniques. Other approaches involve interactions between the researcher and the individuals\\nwho are being studied—ranging from a series of simple questions to extensive, in-depth interviews—to well-\\ncontrolled experiments.\\nEach of these research methods has unique strengths and weaknesses, and each method may only be\\nappropriate for certain types of research questions. For example, studies that rely primarily on observation\\nproduce incredible amounts of information, but the ability to apply this information to the larger population is\\nsomewhat limited because of small sample sizes. Survey research, on the other hand, allows researchers to\\neasily collect data from relatively large samples. While this allows for results to be generalized to the larger\\npopulation more easily, the information that can be collected on any given survey is somewhat limited and\\nsubject to problems associated with any type of self-reported data. Some researchers conduct archival\\nresearch by using existing records. While this can be a fairly inexpensive way to collect data that can provide\\ninsight into a number of research questions, researchers using this approach have no control on how or what\\nkind of data was collected. All of the methods described thus far are correlational in nature. This means that\\nresearchers can speak to important relationships that might exist between two or more variables of interest.\\nHowever, correlational data cannot be used to make claims about cause-and-effect relationships.\\nCorrelational research can find a relationship between two variables, but the only way a researcher can claim\\nthat the relationship between the variables is cause and effect is to perform an experiment. In experimental\\nresearch, which will be discussed later in this chapter, there is a tremendous amount of control over variables\\nof interest. While this is a powerful approach, experiments are often conducted in artificial settings. This calls\\ninto question the validity of experimental findings with regard to how they would apply in real-world settings.\\nIn addition, many of the questions that psychologists would like to answer cannot be pursued through\\nexperimental research because of ethical concerns.\\nClinical or Case Studies\\nIn 2011, the New York Times published a feature story on Krista and Tatiana Hogan, Canadian twin girls.\\nThese particular twins are unique because Krista and Tatiana are conjoined twins, connected at the head.\\nThere is evidence that the two girls are connected in a part of the brain called the thalamus, which is a major\\nsensory relay center. Most incoming sensory information is sent through the thalamus before reaching higher\\nregions of the cerebral cortex for processing.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nWatch this CBC video about Krista's and Tatiana's lives (http://openstax.org/l/hogans) to learn more.\\nThe implications of this potential connection mean that it might be possible for one twin to experience the\\nsensations of the other twin. For instance, if Krista is watching a particularly funny television program, Tatiana\\nmight smile or laugh even if she is not watching the program. This particular possibility has piqued the\\ninterest of many neuroscientists who seek to understand how the brain uses sensory information.\\nThese twins represent an enormous resource in the study of the brain, and since their condition is very rare, it\\nis likely that as long as their family agrees, scientists will follow these girls very closely throughout their lives to\\ngain as much information as possible (Dominus, 2011).\\nOver time, it has become clear that while Krista and Tatiana share some sensory experiences and motor\\ncontrol, they remain two distinct individuals, which provides invaluable insight for researchers interested in\\nthe mind and the brain (Egnor, 2017).\\nIn observational research, scientists are conducting a clinical or case study when they focus on one person or\\njust a few individuals. Indeed, some scientists spend their entire careers studying just 10–20 individuals. Why\\nwould they do this? Obviously, when they focus their attention on a very small number of people, they can gain\\n42 2 • Psychological Research\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\na precious amount of insight into those cases. The richness of information that is collected in clinical or case\\nstudies is unmatched by any other single research method. This allows the researcher to have a very deep\\nunderstanding of the individuals and the particular phenomenon being studied.\\nIf clinical or case studies provide so much information, why are they not more frequent among researchers?\\nAs it turns out, the major benefit of this particular approach is also a weakness. As mentioned earlier, this\\napproach is often used when studying individuals who are interesting to researchers because they have a rare\\ncharacteristic. Therefore, the individuals who serve as the focus of case studies are not like most other people.\\nIf scientists ultimately want to explain all behavior, focusing attention on such a special group of people can\\nmake it difficult to generalize any observations to the larger population as a whole. Generalizing refers to the\\nability to apply the findings of a particular research project to larger segments of society. Again, case studies\\nprovide enormous amounts of information, but since the cases are so specific, the potential to apply what’s\\nlearned to the average person may be very limited.\\nNaturalistic Observation\\nIf you want to understand how behavior occurs, one of the best ways to gain information is to simply observe\\nthe behavior in its natural context. However, people might change their behavior in unexpected ways if they\\nknow they are being observed. How do researchers obtain accurate information when people tend to hide their\\nnatural behavior? As an example, imagine that your professor asks everyone in your class to raise their hand if\\nthey always wash their hands after using the restroom. Chances are that almost everyone in the classroom will\\nraise their hand, but do you think hand washing after every trip to the restroom is really that universal?\\nThis is very similar to the phenomenon mentioned earlier in this chapter: many individuals do not feel\\ncomfortable answering a question honestly. But if we are committed to finding out the facts about hand\\nwashing, we have other options available to us.\\nSuppose we send a classmate into the restroom to actually watch whether everyone washes their hands after\\nusing the restroom. Will our observer blend into the restroom environment by wearing a white lab coat, sitting\\nwith a clipboard, and staring at the sinks? We want our researcher to be inconspicuous—perhaps standing at\\none of the sinks pretending to put in contact lenses while secretly recording the relevant information. This\\ntype of observational study is called naturalistic observation: observing behavior in its natural setting. To\\nbetter understand peer exclusion, Suzanne Fanger collaborated with colleagues at the University of Texas to\\nobserve the behavior of preschool children on a playground. How did the observers remain inconspicuous\\nover the duration of the study? They equipped a few of the children with wireless microphones (which the\\nchildren quickly forgot about) and observed while taking notes from a distance. Also, the children in that\\nparticular preschool (a “laboratory preschool”) were accustomed to having observers on the playground\\n(Fanger, Frankel, & Hazen, 2012).\\nIt is critical that the observer be as unobtrusive and as inconspicuous as possible: when people know they are\\nbeing watched, they are less likely to behave naturally. If you have any doubt about this, ask yourself how your\\ndriving behavior might differ in two situations: In the first situation, you are driving down a deserted highway\\nduring the middle of the day; in the second situation, you are being followed by a police car down the same\\ndeserted highway (Figure 2.7).\\n2.2 • Approaches to Research 43\\nwill result in being ostracized) and his unconscious urges (attraction to males). The idea that he might be gay\\ncauses Joe to have feelings of anxiety. How can he decrease his anxiety? Joe may find himself acting very\\n“macho,” making gay jokes, and picking on a school peer who is gay. This way, Joe’s unconscious impulses are\\nfurther submerged.\\nThere are several different types of defense mechanisms. For instance, in repression, anxiety-causing\\nmemories from consciousness are blocked. As an analogy, let’s say your car is making a strange noise, but\\nbecause you do not have the money to get it fixed, you just turn up the radio so that you no longer hear the\\nstrange noise. Eventually you forget about it. Similarly, in the human psyche, if a memory is too overwhelming\\nto deal with, it might be repressed and thus removed from conscious awareness (Freud, 1920). This repressed\\nmemory might cause symptoms in other areas.\\nAnother defense mechanism is reaction formation, in which someone expresses feelings, thoughts, and\\nbehaviors opposite to their inclinations. In the above example, Joe made fun of a gay peer while himself being\\nattracted to males. In regression, an individual acts much younger than their age. For example, a four-year-old\\nchild who resents the arrival of a newborn sibling may act like a baby and revert to drinking out of a bottle. In\\nprojection, a person refuses to acknowledge her own unconscious feelings and instead sees those feelings in\\nsomeone else. Other defense mechanisms include rationalization, displacement, and sublimation.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nWatch this video of Freud's defense mechanisms (http://openstax.org/l/defmech) to review.\\nStages of Psychosexual Development\\nFreud believed that personality develops during early childhood: Childhood experiences shape our\\npersonalities as well as our behavior as adults. He asserted that we develop via a series of stages during\\nchildhood. Each of us must pass through these childhood stages, and if we do not have the proper nurturing\\nand parenting during a stage, we will be stuck, or fixated, in that stage, even as adults.\\nIn each psychosexual stage of development, the child’s pleasure-seeking urges, coming from the id, are\\nfocused on a different area of the body, called an erogenous zone. The stages are oral, anal, phallic, latency, and\\ngenital (Table 11.1).\\nFreud’s psychosexual development theory is quite controversial. To understand the origins of the theory, it is\\nhelpful to be familiar with the political, social, and cultural influences of Freud’s day in Vienna at the turn of\\nthe 20th century. During this era, a climate of sexual repression, combined with limited understanding and\\neducation surrounding human sexuality, heavily influenced Freud’s perspective. Given that sex was a taboo\\ntopic, Freud assumed that negative emotional states (neuroses) stemmed from suppression of unconscious\\nsexual and aggressive urges. For Freud, his own recollections and interpretations of patients’ experiences and\\ndreams were sufficient proof that psychosexual stages were universal events in early childhood.\\nFreud’s Stages of Psychosexual Development\\nStage Age (years) Erogenous Zone Major Conflict Adult Fixation Example\\nOral 0–1 Mouth Weaning off breast or bottle Smoking, overeating\\nAnal 1–3 Anus Toilet training Neatness, messiness\\nPhallic 3–6 Genitals Oedipus/Electra complex Vanity, overambition\\nLatency 6–12 None None None\\nTABLE 11.1\\n366 11 • Personality\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nStage Age (years) Erogenous Zone Major Conflict Adult Fixation Example\\nGenital 12+ Genitals None None\\nTABLE 11.1\\nOral Stage\\nIn the oral stage (birth to 1 year), pleasure is focused on the mouth. Eating and the pleasure derived from\\nsucking (nipples, pacifiers, and thumbs) play a large part in a baby’s first year of life. At around 1 year of age,\\nbabies are weaned from the bottle or breast, and this process can create conflict if not handled properly by\\ncaregivers. According to Freud, an adult who smokes, drinks, overeats, or bites her nails is fixated in the oral\\nstage of her psychosexual development; she may have been weaned too early or too late, resulting in these\\nfixation tendencies, all of which seek to ease anxiety.\\nAnal Stage\\nAfter passing through the oral stage, children enter what Freud termed the anal stage (1–3 years). In this stage,\\nchildren experience pleasure in their bowel and bladder movements, so it makes sense that the conflict in this\\nstage is over toilet training. During this stage of development, children work to master control of themselves.\\nFreud suggested that success at the anal stage depended on how parents handled toilet training. Parents who\\noffer praise and rewards encourage positive results and can help children feel competent. Parents who are\\nharsh in toilet training can cause a child to become so fearful of soiling that they over-control and become\\nfixated at the anal stage, leading to the development of an anal-retentive personality. The anal-retentive\\npersonality is stingy and stubborn, has a compulsive need for order and neatness, and might be considered a\\nperfectionist. If parents are too lenient in toilet training, the child may fail to develop sufficient self-control,\\nbecome fixated at this stage, and develop an anal-expulsive personality. The anal-expulsive personality is\\nmessy, careless, disorganized, and prone to emotional outbursts.\\nPhallic Stage\\nFreud’s third stage of psychosexual development is the phallic stage (3–6 years), corresponding to the age\\nwhen children become aware of their bodies and recognize the differences between boys and girls. The\\nerogenous zone in this stage is the genitals. Conflict arises when the child feels a desire for the opposite-sex\\nparent, and jealousy and hatred toward the same-sex parent. For boys, this is called the Oedipus complex,\\ninvolving a boy's desire for his mother and his urge to replace his father who is seen as a rival for the mother’s\\nattention. At the same time, the boy is afraid his father will punish him for his feelings, so he experiences\\ncastration anxiety. The Oedipus complex is successfully resolved when the boy begins to identify with his\\nfather as an indirect way to have the mother. Failure to resolve the Oedipus complex may result in fixation and\\ndevelopment of a personality that might be described as vain and overly ambitious.\\nGirls experience a comparable conflict in the phallic stage—the Electra complex. The Electra complex, while\\noften attributed to Freud, was actually proposed by Freud’s protégé, Carl Jung (Jung & Kerenyi, 1963). A girl\\ndesires the attention of her father and wishes to take her mother’s place. Jung also said that girls are angry\\nwith the mother for not providing them with a penis—which he termed penis envy. While Freud initially\\nembraced the Electra complex as a parallel to the Oedipus complex, he later rejected it, yet it remains as a\\ncornerstone of Freudian theory, thanks in part to academics in the field (Freud, 1931/1968; Scott, 2005).\\nLatency Period\\nFollowing the phallic stage of psychosexual development is a period known as the latency period (6 years to\\npuberty). This period is not considered a stage, because sexual feelings are dormant as children focus on other\\npursuits, such as school, friendships, hobbies, and sports. Children generally engage in activities with peers of\\nthe same sex, which serves to consolidate a child’s gender-role identity.\\n11.2 • Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective 367\\nGenital Stage\\nThe final stage is the genital stage (from puberty on). In this stage, there is a sexual reawakening as the\\nincestuous urges resurface. The young person redirects these urges to other, more socially acceptable partners\\n(who often resemble the other-sex parent). People in this stage have mature sexual interests, which for Freud\\nmeant a strong desire for the opposite sex. Individuals who successfully completed the previous stages,\\nreaching the genital stage with no fixations, are said to be well-balanced, healthy adults.\\nWhile most of Freud’s ideas have not found support in modern research, and several contemporary\\nresearchers rejected his premises, we cannot discount the contributions that Freud has made to the field of\\npsychology. It was Freud who pointed out that a large part of our mental life is influenced by the experiences of\\nearly childhood and takes place outside of our conscious awareness; his theories paved the way for others.\\nWhile Freud's focus on biological drives led him to emphasize the impact of sociocultural factors on\\npersonality development, his followers quickly realized that biology alone could not account for the diversity\\nthey encountered as the practice of psychoanalysis spread during the time of the Nazi Holocaust. The\\nantisemitism which was prevalent during this period of time may have led mainstream psychoanalysts to\\nfocus primarily on the universality of the psychological structures of the mind.\\n11.3 Neo-Freudians: Adler, Erikson, Jung, and Horney\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Discuss the concept of the inferiority complex\\n• Discuss the core differences between Erikson’s and Freud’s views on personality\\n• Discuss Jung’s ideas of the collective unconscious and archetypes\\n• Discuss the work of Karen Horney, including her revision of Freud’s “penis envy”\\nFreud attracted many followers who modified his ideas to create new theories about personality. These\\ntheorists, referred to as neo-Freudians, generally agreed with Freud that childhood experiences matter, but\\ndeemphasized sex, focusing more on the social environment and effects of culture on personality. Four notable\\nneo-Freudians include Alfred Adler, Erik Erikson, Carl Jung (pronounced “Yoong”), and Karen Horney\\n(pronounced “HORN-eye”).\\nAlfred Adler\\nAlfred Adler, a colleague of Freud’s and the first president of the Vienna Psychoanalytical Society (Freud’s\\ninner circle of colleagues), was the first major theorist to break away from Freud (Figure 11.8). He\\nsubsequently founded a school of psychology called individual psychology, which focuses on our drive to\\ncompensate for feelings of inferiority. Adler (1937, 1956) proposed the concept of the inferiority complex. An\\ninferiority complex refers to a person’s feelings that they lack worth and don’t measure up to the standards of\\nothers or of society. Adler’s ideas about inferiority represent a major difference between his thinking and\\nFreud’s. Freud believed that we are motivated by sexual and aggressive urges, but Adler (1930, 1961) believed\\nthat feelings of inferiority in childhood are what drive people to attempt to gain superiority and that this\\nstriving is the force behind all of our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.\\n368 11 • Personality\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nFIGURE 11.8 Alfred Adler proposed the concept of the inferiority complex.\\nAdler also believed in the importance of social connections, seeing childhood development emerging through\\nsocial development rather than the sexual stages Freud outlined. Adler noted the inter-relatedness of\\nhumanity and the need to work together for the betterment of all. He said, “The happiness of mankind lies in\\nworking together, in living as if each individual had set himself the task of contributing to the common welfare”\\n(Adler, 1964, p. 255) with the main goal of psychology being “to recognize the equal rights and equality of\\nothers” (Adler, 1961, p. 691).\\nWith these ideas, Adler identified three fundamental social tasks that all of us must experience: occupational\\ntasks (careers), societal tasks (friendship), and love tasks (finding an intimate partner for a long-term\\nrelationship). Rather than focus on sexual or aggressive motives for behavior as Freud did, Adler focused on\\nsocial motives. He also emphasized conscious rather than unconscious motivation, since he believed that the\\nthree fundamental social tasks are explicitly known and pursued. That is not to say that Adler did not also\\nbelieve in unconscious processes—he did—but he felt that conscious processes were more important.\\nOne of Adler’s major contributions to personality psychology was the idea that our birth order shapes our\\npersonality. He proposed that older siblings, who start out as the focus of their parents’ attention but must\\nshare that attention once a new child joins the family, compensate by becoming overachievers. The youngest\\nchildren, according to Adler, may be spoiled, leaving the middle child with the opportunity to minimize the\\nnegative dynamics of the youngest and oldest children. Despite popular attention, research has not\\nconclusively confirmed Adler’s hypotheses about birth order.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nOne of Adler’s major contributions to personality psychology was the idea that our birth order shapes our\\npersonality.

It was Anna Freud\\nwho encouraged Erikson to study psychoanalysis. Erikson received his diploma from the Vienna\\nPsychoanalytic Institute in 1933, and as Nazism spread across Europe, he fled the country and immigrated to\\nthe United States that same year. As you learned when you studied lifespan development, Erikson later\\nproposed a psychosocial theory of development, suggesting that an individual’s personality develops\\nthroughout the lifespan—a departure from Freud’s view that personality is fixed in early life. In his theory,\\nErikson emphasized the social relationships that are important at each stage of personality development, in\\ncontrast to Freud’s emphasis on sex. Erikson identified eight stages, each of which represents a conflict or\\ndevelopmental task (Table 11.2). The development of a healthy personality and a sense of competence depend\\non the successful completion of each task.\\n11.3 • Neo-Freudians: Adler, Erikson, Jung, and Horney 369\\nErikson’s Psychosocial Stages of Development\\nStage Age\\n(years)\\nDevelopmental\\nTask Description\\n1 0–1 Trust vs. mistrust Trust (or mistrust) that basic needs, such as nourishment and affection,\\nwill be met\\n2 1–3 Autonomy vs.\\nshame/doubt Sense of independence in many tasks develops\\n3 3–6 Initiative vs. guilt Take initiative on some activities, may develop guilt when success not\\nmet or boundaries overstepped\\n4 7–11 Industry vs.\\ninferiority\\nDevelop self-confidence in abilities when competent or sense of\\ninferiority when not\\n5 12–18 Identity vs.\\nconfusion Experiment with and develop identity and roles\\n6 19–29 Intimacy vs.\\nisolation Establish intimacy and relationships with others\\n7 30–64 Generativity vs.\\nstagnation Contribute to society and be part of a family\\n8 65– Integrity vs.\\ndespair Assess and make sense of life and meaning of contributions\\nTABLE 11.2\\nCarl Jung\\nCarl Jung (Figure 11.9) was a Swiss psychiatrist and protégé of Freud, who later split off from Freud and\\ndeveloped his own theory, which he called analytical psychology.

Your answer length: less or equal 150 tokens. Plain text, no Markdown. Answer only, no other questions. Context: Use of Research Information Trying to determine which theories are and are not accepted by the scientific community can be difficult, especially in an area of research as broad as psychology. More than ever before, we have an incredible amount of information at our fingertips, and a simple internet search on any given research topic might result in a number of contradictory studies. In these cases, we are witnessing the scientific community going through the process of reaching a consensus, and it could be quite some time before a consensus emerges. For example, the explosion in our use of technology has led researchers to question whether this ultimately helps or hinders us. The use and implementation of technology in educational settings has become widespread over the last few decades. Researchers are coming to different conclusions regarding the use of technology. To illustrate this point, a study investigating a smartphone app targeting surgery residents (graduate students in surgery training) found that the use of this app can increase student engagement and raise test scores (Shaw & Tan, 2015). Conversely, another study found that the use of technology in undergraduate student populations had negative impacts on sleep, communication, and time management skills (Massimini & Peterson, 2009). Until sufficient amounts of research have been conducted, there will be no clear consensus on the effects that technology has on a student's acquisition of knowledge, study skills, and mental health. In the meantime, we should strive to think critically about the information we encounter by exercising a degree of healthy skepticism. When someone makes a claim, we should examine the claim from a number of different perspectives: what is the expertise of the person making the claim, what might they gain if the claim is valid, does the claim seem justified given the evidence, and what do other researchers think of the claim? This is especially important when we consider how much information in advertising campaigns and on the internet claims to be based on “scientific evidence” when in actuality it is a belief or perspective of just a few individuals trying to sell a product or draw attention to their perspectives. We should be informed consumers of the information made available to us because decisions based on this information have significant consequences. One such consequence can be seen in politics and public policy. Imagine that you have been elected to a position of leadership in your community. You are given a task to improve the quality of life for the residents of your town. As you begin to implement your plan, you are encouraged to consult with a variety of experts in the field of public health to help you make the best possible decisions. However, when you ask for their advice, the experts are often reluctant to share their opinions with you because they are afraid of losing their jobs or reputations if they do not agree with your plan. They may also be hesitant to provide you with information that could damage their reputation if they are found to have made a mistake in their opinion. This can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications between you and your experts, as well as a lack of trust and cooperation between them and you. It is important to be aware of these potential issues and to take steps to address them in order to ensure that your decision-making process is as transparent and fair as possible. Another example of a situation where skepticism and critical thinking are important is in scientific research and the development of new technologies. If a new technology is developed that has the potential to revolutionize the way we live and work, researchers and developers must be transparent about its potential risks and benefits so that people can make informed decisions about whether or not to adopt it. Similarly, if a company develops a new product that is marketed as “green” or “eco-friendly,” it must provide consumers with clear information about its environmental impact and how it compares to other products in its category. Without this transparency, consumers may not be able to make an informed decision about which products to purchase or use, which could lead to negative consequences for both the company and the environment. Finally, it's important to remember that skepticism is not a zero-sum game. While skepticism can help us be more critical of what we read or hear and more open-minded when considering new ideas and perspectives, it is also possible that we may be biased or influenced by our own preconceptions and assumptions. Therefore, we should approach new information with an open mind and be willing to engage in ongoing dialogue with others who may have different perspectives or experiences. By doing so,we can build a more inclusive and diverse community of thinkers and practitioners who can work together to create a better future for ourselves and for our planet.

While those with congenital analgesia can detect\\ndifferences in temperature and pressure, they cannot experience pain. As a result, they often suffer significant\\ninjuries. Young children have serious mouth and tongue injuries because they have bitten themselves\\nrepeatedly.

The vestibular organs are fluid-filled and have hair cells, similar to the ones found\\n5.5 • The Other Senses 167\\nin the auditory system, which respond to movement of the head and gravitational forces. When these hair cells\\nare stimulated, they send signals to the brain via the vestibular nerve. Although we may not be consciously\\naware of our vestibular system’s sensory information under normal circumstances, its importance is apparent\\nwhen we experience motion sickness and/or dizziness related to infections of the inner ear (Khan & Chang,\\n2013).\\nFIGURE 5.24 The major sensory organs of the vestibular system are located next to the cochlea in the inner ear.\\nThese include the utricle, saccule, and the three semicircular canals (posterior, superior, and horizontal).\\nIn addition to maintaining balance, the vestibular system collects information critical for controlling\\nmovement and the reflexes that move various parts of our bodies to compensate for changes in body position.\\nTherefore, both proprioception (perception of body position) and kinesthesia (perception of the body’s\\nmovement through space) interact with information provided by the vestibular system.\\nThese sensory systems also gather information from receptors that respond to stretch and tension in muscles,\\njoints, skin, and tendons (Lackner & DiZio, 2005; Proske, 2006; Proske & Gandevia, 2012). Proprioceptive and\\nkinesthetic information travels to the brain via the spinal column. Several cortical regions in addition to the\\ncerebellum receive information from and send information to the sensory organs of the proprioceptive and\\nkinesthetic systems.\\n5.6 Gestalt Principles of Perception\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Explain the figure-ground relationship\\n• Define Gestalt principles of grouping\\n• Describe how perceptual set is influenced by an individual’s characteristics and mental state\\nIn the early part of the 20th century, Max Wertheimer published a paper demonstrating that individuals\\nperceived motion in rapidly flickering static images—an insight that came to him as he used a child’s toy\\ntachistoscope. Wertheimer, and his assistants Wolfgang Köhler and Kurt Koffka, who later became his\\npartners, believed that perception involved more than simply combining sensory stimuli. This belief led to a\\nnew movement within the field of psychology known as Gestalt psychology. The word gestalt literally means\\nform or pattern, but its use reflects the idea that the whole is different from the sum of its parts. In other words,\\nthe brain creates a perception that is more than simply the sum of available sensory inputs, and it does so in\\npredictable ways. Gestalt psychologists translated these predictable ways into principles by which we organize\\nsensory information. As a result, Gestalt psychology has been extremely influential in the area of sensation\\n168 5 • Sensation and Perception\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nand perception (Rock & Palmer, 1990).\\nOne Gestalt principle is the figure-ground relationship. According to this principle, we tend to segment our\\nvisual world into figure and ground. Figure is the object or person that is the focus of the visual field, while the\\nground is the background. As Figure 5.25 shows, our perception can vary tremendously, depending on what is\\nperceived as figure and what is perceived as ground. Presumably, our ability to interpret sensory information\\ndepends on what we label as figure and what we label as ground in any particular case, although this\\nassumption has been called into question (Peterson & Gibson, 1994; Vecera & O’Reilly, 1998).\\nFIGURE 5.25 The concept of figure-ground relationship explains why this image can be perceived either as a vase\\nor as a pair of faces.\\nAnother Gestalt principle for organizing sensory stimuli into meaningful perception is proximity. This\\nprinciple asserts that things that are close to one another tend to be grouped together, as Figure 5.26\\nillustrates.\\nFIGURE 5.26 The Gestalt principle of proximity suggests that you see (a) one block of dots on the left side and (b)\\nthree columns on the right side.\\nHow we read something provides another illustration of the proximity concept. For example, we read this\\nsentence like this, notl iket hiso rt hat. We group the letters of a given word together because there are no\\nspaces between the letters, and we perceive words because there are spaces between each word. Here are\\nsome more examples: Cany oum akes enseo ft hiss entence? What doth es e wor dsmea n?\\nWe might also use the principle of similarity to group things in our visual fields. According to this principle,\\nthings that are alike tend to be grouped together (Figure 5.27). For example, when watching a football game, we\\ntend to group individuals based on the colors of their uniforms. When watching an offensive drive, we can get a\\n5.6 • Gestalt Principles of Perception 169\\nsense of the two teams simply by grouping along this dimension.\\nFIGURE 5.27 When looking at this array of dots, we likely perceive alternating rows of colors. We are grouping these\\ndots according to the principle of similarity.\\nTwo additional Gestalt principles are the law of continuity (or good continuation) and closure. The law of\\ncontinuity suggests that we are more likely to perceive continuous, smooth flowing lines rather than jagged,\\nbroken lines (Figure 5.28). The principle of closure states that we organize our perceptions into complete\\nobjects rather than as a series of parts (Figure 5.29).\\nFIGURE 5.28 Good continuation would suggest that we are more likely to perceive this as two overlapping lines,\\nrather than four lines meeting in the center.\\nFIGURE 5.29 Closure suggests that we will perceive a complete circle and rectangle rather than a series of\\nsegments.\\n170 5 • Sensation and Perception\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nWatch this video showing real world examples of Gestalt principles (http://openstax.org/l/gestalt) to learn\\nmore.\\nAccording to Gestalt theorists, pattern perception, or our ability to discriminate among different figures and\\nshapes, occurs by following the principles described above. You probably feel fairly certain that your\\nperception accurately matches the real world, but this is not always the case. Our perceptions are based on\\nperceptual hypotheses: educated guesses that we make while interpreting sensory information. These\\nhypotheses are informed by a number of factors, including our personalities, experiences, and expectations.\\nWe use these hypotheses to generate our perceptual set. For instance, research has demonstrated that those\\nwho are given verbal priming produce a biased interpretation of complex ambiguous figures (Goolkasian &\\nWoodbury, 2010).\\nThe Depths of Perception: Bias, Prejudice, and Cultural Factors\\nIn this chapter, you have learned that perception is a complex process. Built from sensations, but influenced by\\nour own experiences, biases, prejudices, and cultures, perceptions can be very different from person to person.\\nResearch suggests that implicit racial prejudice and stereotypes affect perception. For instance, several studies\\nhave demonstrated that non-Black participants identify weapons faster and are more likely to identify non-\\nweapons as weapons when the image of the weapon is paired with the image of a Black person (Payne, 2001;\\nPayne, Shimizu, & Jacoby, 2005). Furthermore, White individuals’ decisions to shoot an armed target in a video\\ngame is made more quickly when the target is Black (Correll, Park, Judd, & Wittenbrink, 2002; Correll, Urland, &\\nIto, 2006). This research is important, considering the number of very high-profile cases in the last few decades\\nin which Black people were killed by people who claimed to believe that the unarmed individuals were armed\\nand/or represented some threat to their personal safety.\\nDIG DEEPER\\n5.6 • Gestalt Principles of Perception 171\\nKey Terms\\nabsolute threshold minimum amount of stimulus energy that must be present for the stimulus to be detected\\n50% of the time\\nafterimage continuation of a visual sensation after removal of the stimulus\\namplitude height of a wave\\nbasilar membrane thin strip of tissue within the cochlea that contains the hair cells which serve as the\\nsensory receptors for the auditory system\\nbinaural cue two-eared cue to localize sound\\nbinocular cue cue that relies on the use of both eyes\\nbinocular disparity slightly different view of the world that each eye receives\\nblind spot point where we cannot respond to visual information in that portion of the visual field\\nbottom-up processing system in which perceptions are built from sensory input\\nclosure organizing our perceptions into complete objects rather than as a series of parts\\ncochlea fluid-filled, snail-shaped structure that contains the sensory receptor cells of the auditory system\\ncochlear implant electronic device that consists of a microphone, a speech processor, and an electrode array\\nto directly stimulate the auditory nerve to transmit information to the brain\\nconductive hearing loss failure in the vibration of the eardrum and/or movement of the ossicles\\ncone specialized photoreceptor that works best in bright light conditions and detects color\\ncongenital deafness deafness from birth\\ncongenital insensitivity to pain (congenital analgesia) genetic disorder that results in the inability to\\nexperience pain\\ncornea transparent covering over the eye\\ndeafness partial or complete inability to hear\\ndecibel (dB) logarithmic unit of sound intensity\\ndepth perception ability to perceive depth\\nelectromagnetic spectrum all the electromagnetic radiation that occurs in our environment\\nfigure-ground relationship segmenting our visual world into figure and ground\\nfovea small indentation in the retina that contains cones\\nfrequency number of waves that pass a given point in a given time period\\nGestalt psychology field of psychology based on the idea that the whole is different from the sum of its parts\\ngood continuation (also, continuity) we are more likely to perceive continuous, smooth flowing lines rather\\nthan jagged, broken lines\\nhair cell auditory receptor cell of the inner ear\\nhertz (Hz) cycles per second;

Some individuals are born without the ability to feel pain. This very rare genetic disorder is known as congenital insensitivity to pain (or congenital analgesia). While those with congenital analgesia can detect differences in temperature and pressure, they cannot experience pain. As a result, these individuals will not be able to tell the difference between a hot or cold object and a sharp or sharp object. They will also not be able to differentiate between hot and cold temperatures, as well as between pressure and force. Because of their inability to detect pain, individuals with this condition will have a very low pain threshold, meaning that they will experience much more pain than they would if they were not born with the condition. Individuals with this condition are often referred to as “painless” because they do not experience any pain at all. However, painful sensations can still be experienced, but they are not as intense as those experienced by individuals without this genetic condition. There are two main ways in which pain perception is affected by genetic factors. One way is through mutations in genes that encode proteins involved in pain signaling. For example, a mutation in a gene that encodes a pain receptor protein could result in an individual being unable to sense pain. The other way that genetic mutations can affect pain sensitivity is by altering the structure of proteins involved with pain transmission. A mutation that changes the amino acid sequence of a protein can result in a change in how the protein interacts with other proteins and how it is transported across the cell membrane. These changes in protein structure can alter the way pain messages are transmitted, resulting in altered pain perception. Genetic factors can also play a role in determining whether or not a person will develop chronic pain symptoms. Chronic pain symptoms are defined as pain that persists for at least 3 months, or 6 months in cases where there is no apparent cause for the symptoms. There is some evidence to suggest that certain genetic variations may increase the risk of developing chronic low back pain or osteoarthritis. It is also known that people with a genetic predisposition to chronic conditions may be at a higher risk for developing chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, stroke, cancer, osteoporosis, depression, and anxiety. People who are predisposed to these conditions are more likely than others to develop these conditions and to experience more severe symptoms when they develop them. Therefore, if someone has a family history of chronic health conditions, it would be wise for them to take steps to reduce their risk for developing such conditions. Some of these steps include eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, getting regular checkups, avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, managing stress levels, taking medications as prescribed by their', 'references': '{\"sections\": [\"Learning\", \"Learning/Classical Conditioning\", \"Learning/What Is Learning?\"], \"pages\": [\"181\", \"183\", \"182\"]}'}\n",

By watching his father, he can imitate\\nthe moves that bring success and avoid the moves that lead to failure. Can you think of something you have\\nlearned how to do after watching someone else?\\nAll of the approaches covered in this chapter are part of a particular tradition in psychology, called\\nbehaviorism, which we discuss in the next section. However, these approaches do not represent the entire\\nstudy of learning. Separate traditions of learning have taken shape within different fields of psychology, such\\nas memory and cognition, so you will find that other chapters will round out your understanding of the topic.\\nOver time these traditions tend to converge. For example, in this chapter you will see how cognition has come\\nto play a larger role in behaviorism, whose more extreme adherents once insisted that behaviors are triggered\\nby the environment with no intervening thought.\\n6.2 Classical Conditioning\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Explain how classical conditioning occurs\\n• Summarize the processes of acquisition, extinction, spontaneous recovery, generalization, and discrimination\\nDoes the name Ivan Pavlov ring a bell? Even if you are new to the study of psychology, chances are that you\\nhave heard of Pavlov and his famous dogs.\\nPavlov (1849–1936), a Russian scientist, performed extensive research on dogs and is best known for his\\nexperiments in classical conditioning (Figure 6.3). As we discussed briefly in the previous section, classical\\nconditioning is a process by which we learn to associate stimuli and, consequently, to anticipate events.\\n6.2 • Classical Conditioning 183\\nFIGURE 6.3 Ivan Pavlov’s research on the digestive system of dogs unexpectedly led to his discovery of the learning\\nprocess now known as classical conditioning.\\nPavlov came to his conclusions about how learning occurs completely by accident. Pavlov was a physiologist,\\nnot a psychologist. Physiologists study the life processes of organisms, from the molecular level to the level of\\ncells, organ systems, and entire organisms. Pavlov’s area of interest was the digestive system (Hunt, 2007). In\\nhis studies with dogs, Pavlov measured the amount of saliva produced in response to various foods. Over time,\\nPavlov (1927) observed that the dogs began to salivate not only at the taste of food, but also at the sight of food,\\nat the sight of an empty food bowl, and even at the sound of the laboratory assistants\\' footsteps. Salivating to\\nfood in the mouth is reflexive, so no learning is involved. However, dogs don’t naturally salivate at the sight of\\nan empty bowl or the sound of footsteps.\\nThese unusual responses intrigued Pavlov, and he wondered what accounted for what he called the dogs\\'\\n“psychic secretions” (Pavlov, 1927). To explore this phenomenon in an objective manner, Pavlov designed a\\nseries of carefully controlled experiments to see which stimuli would cause the dogs to salivate. He was able to\\ntrain the dogs to salivate in response to stimuli that clearly had nothing to do with food, such as the sound of a\\nbell, a light, and a touch on the leg. Through his experiments, Pavlov realized that an organism has two types of\\nresponses to its environment: (1) unconditioned (unlearned) responses, or reflexes, and (2) conditioned\\n(learned) responses.\\nIn Pavlov’s experiments, the dogs salivated each time meat powder was presented to them. The meat powder\\nin this situation was an unconditioned stimulus (UCS): a stimulus that elicits a reflexive response in an\\norganism. The dogs’ salivation was an unconditioned response (UCR): a natural (unlearned) reaction to a\\ngiven stimulus. Before conditioning, think of the dogs’ stimulus and response like this:\\nIn classical conditioning, a neutral stimulus is presented immediately before an unconditioned stimulus.\\nPavlov would sound a tone (like ringing a bell) and then give the dogs the meat powder (Figure 6.4). The tone\\nwas the neutral stimulus (NS), which is a stimulus that does not naturally elicit a response. Prior to\\nconditioning, the dogs did not salivate when they just heard the tone because the tone had no association for\\nthe dogs.\\nWhen Pavlov paired the tone with the meat powder over and over again, the previously neutral stimulus (the\\ntone) also began to elicit salivation from the dogs. Thus, the neutral stimulus became the conditioned\\nstimulus (CS), which is a stimulus that elicits a response after repeatedly being paired with an unconditioned\\nstimulus. Eventually, the dogs began to salivate to the tone alone, just as they previously had salivated at the\\nsound of the assistants’ footsteps. The behavior caused by the conditioned stimulus is called the conditioned\\nresponse (CR). In the case of Pavlov’s dogs, they had learned to associate the tone (CS) with being fed, and they\\nbegan to salivate (CR) in anticipation of food.\\n184 6 • Learning\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nFIGURE 6.4 Before conditioning, an unconditioned stimulus (food) produces an unconditioned response\\n(salivation), and a neutral stimulus (bell) does not produce a response. During conditioning, the unconditioned\\nstimulus (food) is presented repeatedly just after the presentation of the neutral stimulus (bell). After conditioning,\\nthe neutral stimulus alone produces a conditioned response (salivation), thus becoming a conditioned stimulus.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nView this video about Pavlov and his dogs (http://openstax.org/l/pavlov2) to learn more.\\nReal World Application of Classical Conditioning\\nHow does classical conditioning work in the real world? Consider the case of Moisha, who was diagnosed with\\ncancer. When she received her first chemotherapy treatment, she vomited shortly after the chemicals were\\ninjected. In fact, every trip to the doctor for chemotherapy treatment shortly after the drugs were injected, she\\nvomited. Moisha’s treatment was a success and her cancer went into remission. Now, when she visits her\\noncologist\\'s office every 6 months for a check-up, she becomes nauseous. In this case, the chemotherapy drugs\\nare the unconditioned stimulus (UCS), vomiting is the unconditioned response (UCR), the doctor’s office is the\\nconditioned stimulus (CS) after being paired with the UCS, and nausea is the conditioned response (CR). Let\\'s\\nassume that the chemotherapy drugs that Moisha takes are given through a syringe injection. After entering\\nthe doctor\\'s office, Moisha sees a syringe, and then gets her medication. In addition to the doctor\\'s office,\\nMoisha will learn to associate the syringe with the medication and will respond to syringes with nausea. This is\\nan example of higher-order (or second-order) conditioning, when the conditioned stimulus (the doctor\\'s office)\\nserves to condition another stimulus (the syringe). It is hard to achieve anything above second-order\\nconditioning. For example, if someone rang a bell every time Moisha received a syringe injection of\\nchemotherapy drugs in the doctor\\'s office, Moisha likely will never get sick in response to the bell.\\nConsider another example of classical conditioning. Let’s say you have a cat named Tiger, who is quite spoiled.\\nYou keep her food in a separate cabinet, and you also have a special electric can opener that you use only to\\nopen cans of cat food. For every meal, Tiger hears the distinctive sound of the electric can opener (“zzhzhz”)\\nand then gets her food. Tiger quickly learns that when she hears “zzhzhz” she is about to get fed. What do you\\nthink Tiger does when she hears the electric can opener? She will likely get excited and run to where you are\\n6.2 • Classical Conditioning 185\\npreparing her food. This is an example of classical conditioning. In this case, what are the UCS, CS, UCR, and\\nCR?\\nWhat if the cabinet holding Tiger’s food becomes squeaky? In that case, Tiger hears “squeak” (the cabinet),\\n“zzhzhz” (the electric can opener), and then she gets her food. Tiger will learn to get excited when she hears\\nthe “squeak” of the cabinet. Pairing a new neutral stimulus (“squeak”) with the conditioned stimulus\\n(“zzhzhz”) is called higher-order conditioning, or second-order conditioning. This means you are using the\\nconditioned stimulus of the can opener to condition another stimulus: the squeaky cabinet (Figure 6.5). It is\\nhard to achieve anything above second-order conditioning. For example, if you ring a bell, open the cabinet\\n(“squeak”), use the can opener (“zzhzhz”), and then feed Tiger, Tiger will likely never get excited when hearing\\nthe bell alone.\\nFIGURE 6.5 In higher-order conditioning, an established conditioned stimulus is paired with a new neutral stimulus\\n(the second-order stimulus), so that eventually the new stimulus also elicits the conditioned response, without the\\ninitial conditioned stimulus being presented.\\nClassical Conditioning at Stingray City\\nKate and her spouse recently vacationed in the Cayman Islands, and booked a boat tour to Stingray City, where\\nthey could feed and swim with the southern stingrays. The boat captain explained how the normally solitary\\nstingrays have become accustomed to interacting with humans. About 40 years ago, people began to clean fish\\nEVERYDAY CONNECTION\\n186 6 • Learning\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nand conch (unconditioned stimulus) at a particular sandbar near a barrier reef, and large numbers of stingrays\\nwould swim in to eat (unconditioned response) what the people threw into the water; this continued for years. By\\nthe late 1980s, word of the large group of stingrays spread among scuba divers, who then started feeding them\\nby hand. Over time, the southern stingrays in the area were classically conditioned much like Pavlov’s dogs.\\nWhen they hear the sound of a boat engine (neutral stimulus that becomes a conditioned stimulus), they know\\nthat they will get to eat (conditioned response).\\nAs soon as they reached Stingray City, over two dozen stingrays surrounded their tour boat. The couple slipped\\ninto the water with bags of squid, the stingrays’ favorite treat. The swarm of stingrays bumped and rubbed up\\nagainst their legs like hungry cats (Figure 6.6). Kate was able to feed, pet, and even kiss (for luck) these amazing\\ncreatures. Then all the squid was gone, and so were the stingrays.\\nFIGURE 6.6 Kate holds a southern stingray at Stingray City in the Cayman Islands. These stingrays have been\\nclassically conditioned to associate the sound of a boat motor with food provided by tourists. (credit: Kathryn\\nDumper)\\nClassical conditioning also applies to humans, even babies. For example, Elan buys formula in blue canisters\\nfor their six-month-old daughter, Angelina. Whenever Elan takes out a formula container, Angelina gets\\nexcited, tries to reach toward the food, and most likely salivates. Why does Angelina get excited when she sees\\nthe formula canister? What are the UCS, CS, UCR, and CR here?\\nSo far, all of the examples have involved food, but classical conditioning extends beyond the basic need to be\\nfed. Consider our earlier example of a dog whose owners install an invisible electric dog fence. A small\\nelectrical shock (unconditioned stimulus) elicits discomfort (unconditioned response). When the\\nunconditioned stimulus (shock) is paired with a neutral stimulus (the edge of a yard), the dog associates the\\ndiscomfort (unconditioned response) with the edge of the yard (conditioned stimulus) and stays within the set\\nboundaries. In this example, the edge of the yard elicits fear and anxiety in the dog. Fear and anxiety are the\\nconditioned response.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nWatch this video clip from the television show, The Office, for a humorous look at conditioning\\n(http://openstax.org/l/theoffice) in which Jim conditions Dwight to expect a breath mint every time Jim’s\\ncomputer makes a specific sound.\\n6.2 • Classical Conditioning 187\\nbeen a prosocial model in your life?\\nThe antisocial effects of observational learning are also worth mentioning.

In fact, about 30% of child abuse victims become abusive parents (U.S.\\nDepartment of Health & Human Services, 2013). We tend to do what we know. Children who grow up\\nwitnessing their parents deal with anger and frustration through violent and aggressive acts often learn to\\nbehave in that manner themselves.\\nSome studies suggest that violent television shows, movies, and video games may also have antisocial effects\\n(Figure 6.18) although further research needs to be done to understand the correlational and causational\\naspects of media violence and behavior. Some studies have found a link between viewing violence and\\naggression seen in children (Anderson & Gentile, 2008; Kirsch, 2010; Miller, Grabell, Thomas, Bermann, &\\nGraham-Bermann, 2012). These findings may not be surprising, given that a child graduating from high school\\nhas been exposed to around 200,000 violent acts including murder, robbery, torture, bombings, beatings, and\\nrape through various forms of media (Huston et al., 1992). Not only might viewing media violence affect\\naggressive behavior by teaching people to act that way in real life situations, but it has also been suggested that\\nrepeated exposure to violent acts also desensitizes people to it. Psychologists are working to understand this\\ndynamic.\\nFIGURE 6.18 Can viewing violent media make us violent? Psychological researchers study this topic.

In contrast,\\nlearning is a change in behavior or knowledge that results from experience. There are three main types of\\nlearning: classical conditioning, operant conditioning, and observational learning. Both classical and operant\\nconditioning are forms of associative learning where associations are made between events that occur\\ntogether. Observational learning is just as it sounds: learning by observing others.\\n6.2 Classical Conditioning\\nPavlov’s pioneering work with dogs contributed greatly to what we know about learning. His experiments\\nexplored the type of associative learning we now call classical conditioning. In classical conditioning,\\norganisms learn to associate events that repeatedly happen together, and researchers study how a reflexive\\nresponse to a stimulus can be mapped to a different stimulus—by training an association between the two\\nstimuli. Pavlov’s experiments show how stimulus-response bonds are formed. Watson, the founder of\\nbehaviorism, was greatly influenced by Pavlov’s work. He tested humans by conditioning fear in an infant\\nknown as Little Albert. His findings suggest that classical conditioning can explain how some fears develop.\\n6.3 Operant Conditioning\\nOperant conditioning is based on the work of B. F. Skinner. Operant conditioning is a form of learning in which\\nthe motivation for a behavior happens after the behavior is demonstrated. An animal or a human receives a\\nconsequence after performing a specific behavior. The consequence is either a reinforcer or a punisher. All\\nreinforcement (positive or negative) increases the likelihood of a behavioral response. All punishment\\n(positive or negative) decreases the likelihood of a behavioral response. Several types of reinforcement\\nschedules are used to reward behavior depending on either a set or variable period of time.\\n6.4 Observational Learning (Modeling)\\nAccording to Bandura, learning can occur by watching others and then modeling what they do or say. This is\\nknown as observational learning. There are specific steps in the process of modeling that must be followed if\\nlearning is to be successful. These steps include attention, retention, reproduction, and motivation. Through\\nmodeling, Bandura has shown that children learn many things both good and bad simply by watching their\\nparents, siblings, and others.\\nReview Questions\\n1.

After repeated experiences, Hodor begins to associate the act of sitting with receiving a treat. He learns that the consequence of sitting is that he gets a doggie biscuit (Figure 6.2). Conversely, if the dog is punished when exhibiting a behavior, it becomes conditioned to avoid that behavior (e.g., receiving a small shock when crossing the boundary of an invisible electric fence). FIGURE 6.2 In operant conditioning, a response is associated with a consequence. This dog has learned that certain behaviors result in receiving a treat. (credit: Crystal Rolfe) Observational learning extends the effective range of both classical and operant conditioning. In contrast to classical and operant conditioning, in which learning occurs only through direct experience, observational learning is the process of watching others and then imitating what they do. A lot of learning among humans and other animals comes from observational learning. To get an idea of the extra effective range that observational learning brings, consider Ben and his son Julian from the introduction. How might observation help Julian learn to surf, as opposed to learning by trial and error alone? By watching his father, he can imitate the moves that bring success and avoid the moves that lead to failure. Can you think of something you have learned how to do after watching someone else? All of the approaches covered in this chapter are part of a particular tradition in psychology, called behaviorism, which we discuss in the next section. However, these approaches do not represent the entire study of learning. Separate traditions of learning have taken shape within different fields of psychology, such as memory and cognition, so you will find that other chapters will round out your understanding of the topic. Over time these traditions tend to converge. For example, in this chapter you will see how cognition has come to play a larger role in behaviorism, whose more extreme adherents once insisted that behaviors are triggered by the environment with no intervening thought. 6.2 Classical Conditioning LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Explain how classical conditioning occurs • Summarize the processes of acquisition, extinction, spontaneous recovery, generalization and generalization Classical conditioning is a process by which a conditioned stimulus (CS) is paired with an unconditioned stimulus (UCS) to produce a new conditioned response (CR). In other words, the CS and the UCS are associated in such a way that, when they are presented together, they produce the CR. Classical conditioning can be thought of as a form of associative learning, but it differs from other forms of associative learning in that it is based on the association between two stimuli that are not directly related to each other. The CS is called a neutral stimulus because it does not elicit any response from any other stimulus, while the UC is referred to as an aversive stimulus since it elicits a negative response from any other stimuli. Figure 7.1 shows a diagrammatic representation of how this process occurs. Figure 5.3 shows an example of classical association. You can see that when a person hears the word “cat” and sees a cat, their mouth opens and they say “cat.” This is an instance of conditioned association. When the same word is presented to the person again, this time without seeing the cat, their mouth still opens, even though they have not heard the original word. They are still associating this word with the visual stimulus that they saw before. Thus, conditioned association occurs when two stimuli, one of which is neutral, are paired together and produce an effect on a second stimulus, which is also neutral. In the following sections, we will discuss the different types of conditioning and how they differ from each other. We will also discuss how conditioning can occur in a variety of contexts, including learning to ride a bicycle, to play the piano, or to drive a car. 70 71 6 CLASSICAL CONDITIONING DISCUSSION QUESTIONS 1.

As far\\nas the advertiser is concerned, that athlete is no longer associated with positive feelings; therefore, the athlete\\ncannot be used as an unconditioned stimulus to condition the public to associate positive feelings (the\\nunconditioned response) with their product (the conditioned stimulus).\\nNow that you are aware of how associative learning works, see if you can find examples of these types of\\nadvertisements on television, in magazines, or on the Internet.\\n6.3 Operant Conditioning\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Define operant conditioning\\n• Explain the difference between reinforcement and punishment\\n• Distinguish between reinforcement schedules\\nThe previous section of this chapter focused on the type of associative learning known as classical\\nconditioning. Remember that in classical conditioning, something in the environment triggers a reflex\\nautomatically, and researchers train the organism to react to a different stimulus. Now we turn to the second\\ntype of associative learning, operant conditioning. In operant conditioning, organisms learn to associate a\\nbehavior and its consequence (Table 6.1). A pleasant consequence makes that behavior more likely to be\\nrepeated in the future. For example, Spirit, a dolphin at the National Aquarium in Baltimore, does a flip in the\\nair when her trainer blows a whistle. The consequence is that she gets a fish.\\nEVERYDAY CONNECTION\\n192 6 • Learning\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nClassical and Operant Conditioning Compared\\nClassical Conditioning Operant Conditioning\\nConditioning\\napproach\\nAn unconditioned stimulus (such as food) is paired\\nwith a neutral stimulus (such as a bell). The neutral\\nstimulus eventually becomes the conditioned\\nstimulus, which brings about the conditioned\\nresponse (salivation).\\nThe target behavior is followed by\\nreinforcement or punishment to either\\nstrengthen or weaken it, so that the\\nlearner is more likely to exhibit the desired\\nbehavior in the future.\\nStimulus\\ntiming\\nThe stimulus occurs immediately before the\\nresponse.\\nThe stimulus (either reinforcement or\\npunishment) occurs soon after the\\nresponse.\\nTABLE 6.1\\nPsychologist B. F. Skinner saw that classical conditioning is limited to existing behaviors that are reflexively\\nelicited, and it doesn’t account for new behaviors such as riding a bike. He proposed a theory about how such\\nbehaviors come about. Skinner believed that behavior is motivated by the consequences we receive for the\\nbehavior: the reinforcements and punishments. His idea that learning is the result of consequences is based\\non the law of effect, which was first proposed by psychologist Edward Thorndike. According to the law of\\neffect, behaviors that are followed by consequences that are satisfying to the organism are more likely to be\\nrepeated, and behaviors that are followed by unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated\\n(Thorndike, 1911). Essentially, if an organism does something that brings about a desired result, the organism\\nis more likely to do it again. If an organism does something that does not bring about a desired result, the\\norganism is less likely to do it again. An example of the law of effect is in employment. One of the reasons (and\\noften the main reason) we show up for work is because we get paid to do so. If we stop getting paid, we will\\nlikely stop showing up—even if we love our job.\\nWorking with Thorndike’s law of effect as his foundation, Skinner began conducting scientific experiments on\\nanimals (mainly rats and pigeons) to determine how organisms learn through operant conditioning (Skinner,\\n1938). He placed these animals inside an operant conditioning chamber, which has come to be known as a\\n“Skinner box” (Figure 6.10). A Skinner box contains a lever (for rats) or disk (for pigeons) that the animal can\\npress or peck for a food reward via the dispenser. Speakers and lights can be associated with certain behaviors.\\nA recorder counts the number of responses made by the animal.\\nFIGURE 6.10 (a) B. F. Skinner developed operant conditioning for systematic study of how behaviors are\\nstrengthened or weakened according to their consequences.

In operant conditioning, positive and negative do not mean good and\\nbad. Instead, positive means you are adding something, and negative means you are taking something away.\\nReinforcement means you are increasing a behavior, and punishment means you are decreasing a behavior.\\nReinforcement can be positive or negative, and punishment can also be positive or negative. All reinforcers\\n(positive or negative) increase the likelihood of a behavioral response. All punishers (positive or negative)\\ndecrease the likelihood of a behavioral response. Now let’s combine these four terms: positive reinforcement,\\nnegative reinforcement, positive punishment, and negative punishment (Table 6.2).\\nPositive and Negative Reinforcement and Punishment\\nReinforcement Punishment\\nPositive Something is added to increase the likelihood of a\\nbehavior.\\nSomething is added to decrease the likelihood of a\\nbehavior.\\nNegative Something is removed to increase the likelihood\\nof a behavior.\\nSomething is removed to decrease the likelihood\\nof a behavior.\\nTABLE 6.2\\nReinforcement\\nThe most effective way to teach a person or animal a new behavior is with positive reinforcement. In positive\\nreinforcement, a desirable stimulus is added to increase a behavior.\\nFor example, you tell your five-year-old son, Jerome, that if he cleans his room, he will get a toy. Jerome quickly\\ncleans his room because he wants a new art set. Let’s pause for a moment. Some people might say, “Why\\nshould I reward my child for doing what is expected?” But in fact we are constantly and consistently rewarded\\nin our lives. Our paychecks are rewards, as are high grades and acceptance into our preferred school. Being\\npraised for doing a good job and for passing a driver’s test is also a reward. Positive reinforcement as a\\nlearning tool is extremely effective. It has been found that one of the most effective ways to increase\\nachievement in school districts with below-average reading scores was to pay the children to read. Specifically,\\nsecond-grade students in Dallas were paid $2 each time they read a book and passed a short quiz about the\\nbook. The result was a significant increase in reading comprehension (Fryer, 2010). What do you think about\\nthis program? If Skinner were alive today, he would probably think this was a great idea. He was a strong\\nproponent of using operant conditioning principles to influence students’ behavior at school. In fact, in\\naddition to the Skinner box, he also invented what he called a teaching machine that was designed to reward\\nsmall steps in learning (Skinner, 1961)—an early forerunner of computer-assisted learning. His teaching\\nmachine tested students’ knowledge as they worked through various school subjects. If students answered\\nquestions correctly, they received immediate positive reinforcement and could continue; if they answered\\nincorrectly, they did not receive any reinforcement. The idea was that students would spend additional time\\nstudying the material to increase their chance of being reinforced the next time (Skinner, 1961).\\nIn negative reinforcement, an undesirable stimulus is removed to increase a behavior. For example, car\\nmanufacturers use the principles of negative reinforcement in their seatbelt systems, which go “beep, beep,\\nbeep” until you fasten your seatbelt. The annoying sound stops when you exhibit the desired behavior,\\n194 6 • Learning\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nincreasing the likelihood that you will buckle up in the future. Negative reinforcement is also used frequently\\nin horse training. Riders apply pressure—by pulling the reins or squeezing their legs—and then remove the\\npressure when the horse performs the desired behavior, such as turning or speeding up. The pressure is the\\nnegative stimulus that the horse wants to remove.\\nPunishment\\nMany people confuse negative reinforcement with punishment in operant conditioning, but they are two very\\ndifferent mechanisms. Remember that reinforcement, even when it is negative, always increases a behavior. In\\ncontrast, punishment always decreases a behavior. In positive punishment, you add an undesirable stimulus\\nto decrease a behavior. An example of positive punishment is scolding a student to get the student to stop\\ntexting in class. In this case, a stimulus (the reprimand) is added in order to decrease the behavior (texting in\\nclass). In negative punishment, you remove a pleasant stimulus to decrease behavior. For example, when a\\nchild misbehaves, a parent can take away a favorite toy. In this case, a stimulus (the toy) is removed in order to\\ndecrease the behavior.\\nPunishment, especially when it is immediate, is one way to decrease undesirable behavior. For example,\\nimagine your four-year-old son, Brandon, hit his younger brother. You have Brandon write 100 times “I will not\\nhit my brother\" (positive punishment). Chances are he won’t repeat this behavior. While strategies like this are\\ncommon today, in the past children were often subject to physical punishment, such as spanking. It’s\\nimportant to be aware of some of the drawbacks in using physical punishment on children. First, punishment\\nmay teach fear. Brandon may become fearful of the street, but he also may become fearful of the person who\\ndelivered the punishment—you, his parent. Similarly, children who are punished by teachers may come to fear\\nthe teacher and try to avoid school (Gershoff et al., 2010). Consequently, most schools in the United States have\\nbanned corporal punishment. Second, punishment may cause children to become more aggressive and prone\\nto antisocial behavior and delinquency (Gershoff, 2002). They see their parents resort to spanking when they\\nbecome angry and frustrated, so, in turn, they may act out this same behavior when they become angry and\\nfrustrated. For example, because you spank Brenda when you are angry with her for her misbehavior, she\\nmight start hitting her friends when they won’t share their toys.\\nWhile positive punishment can be effective in some cases, Skinner suggested that the use of punishment\\nshould be weighed against the possible negative effects. Today’s psychologists and parenting experts favor\\nreinforcement over punishment—they recommend that you catch your child doing something good and reward\\nthem for it.\\nShaping\\nIn his operant conditioning experiments, Skinner often used an approach called shaping. Instead of rewarding\\nonly the target behavior, in shaping, we reward successive approximations of a target behavior. Why is shaping\\nneeded? Remember that in order for reinforcement to work, the organism must first display the behavior.\\nShaping is needed because it is extremely unlikely that an organism will display anything but the simplest of\\nbehaviors spontaneously. In shaping, behaviors are broken down into many small, achievable steps. The\\nspecific steps used in the process are the following:\\n1. Reinforce any response that resembles the desired behavior.\\n2. Then reinforce the response that more closely resembles the desired behavior. You will no longer reinforce\\nthe previously reinforced response.\\n3. Next, begin to reinforce the response that even more closely resembles the desired behavior.\\n4. Continue to reinforce closer and closer approximations of the desired behavior.\\n5. Finally, only reinforce the desired behavior.\\nShaping is often used in teaching a complex behavior or chain of behaviors. Skinner used shaping to teach\\npigeons not only such relatively simple behaviors as pecking a disk in a Skinner box, but also many unusual\\nand entertaining behaviors, such as turning in circles, walking in figure eights, and even playing ping pong; the\\n6.3 • Operant Conditioning 195\\ntechnique is commonly used by animal trainers today. An important part of shaping is stimulus\\ndiscrimination. Recall Pavlov’s dogs—he trained them to respond to the tone of a bell, and not to similar tones\\nor sounds. This discrimination is also important in operant conditioning and in shaping behavior.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nWatch this brief video of Skinner\\'s pigeons playing ping pong (http://openstax.org/l/pingpong) to learn more.\\nIt’s easy to see how shaping is effective in teaching behaviors to animals, but how does shaping work with\\nhumans? Let’s consider parents whose goal is to have their child learn to clean his room. They use shaping to\\nhelp him master steps toward the goal. Instead of performing the entire task, they set up these steps and\\nreinforce each step. First, he cleans up one toy. Second, he cleans up five toys. Third, he chooses whether to\\npick up ten toys or put his books and clothes away. Fourth, he cleans up everything except two toys. Finally, he\\ncleans his entire room.\\nPrimary and Secondary Reinforcers\\nRewards such as stickers, praise, money, toys, and more can be used to reinforce learning. Let’s go back to\\nSkinner’s rats again. How did the rats learn to press the lever in the Skinner box? They were rewarded with\\nfood each time they pressed the lever. For animals, food would be an obvious reinforcer.\\nWhat would be a good reinforcer for humans? For your child Chris, it was the promise of a toy when they\\ncleaned their room. How about Sydney, the soccer player? If you gave Sydney a piece of candy every time\\nSydney scored a goal, you would be using a primary reinforcer. Primary reinforcers are reinforcers that have\\ninnate reinforcing qualities. These kinds of reinforcers are not learned. Water, food, sleep, shelter, sex, and\\ntouch, among others, are primary reinforcers. Pleasure is also a primary reinforcer. Organisms do not lose\\ntheir drive for these things. For most people, jumping in a cool lake on a very hot day would be reinforcing and\\nthe cool lake would be innately reinforcing—the water would cool the person off (a physical need), as well as\\nprovide pleasure.\\nA secondary reinforcer has no inherent value and only has reinforcing qualities when linked with a primary\\nreinforcer. Praise, linked to affection, is one example of a secondary reinforcer, as when you called out “Great\\nshot!” every time Sydney made a goal. Another example, money, is only worth something when you can use it\\nto buy other things—either things that satisfy basic needs (food, water, shelter—all primary reinforcers) or\\nother secondary reinforcers. If you were on a remote island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and you had\\nstacks of money, the money would not be useful if you could not spend it. What about the stickers on the\\nbehavior chart? They also are secondary reinforcers.\\nSometimes, instead of stickers on a sticker chart, a token is used. Tokens, which are also secondary\\nreinforcers, can then be traded in for rewards and prizes. Entire behavior management systems, known as\\ntoken economies, are built around the use of these kinds of token reinforcers. Token economies have been\\nfound to be very effective at modifying behavior in a variety of settings such as schools, prisons, and mental\\nhospitals. For example, a study by Adibsereshki and Abkenar (2014) found that use of a token economy\\nincreased appropriate social behaviors and reduced inappropriate behaviors in a group of eight grade\\nstudents. Similar studies show demonstrable gains on behavior and academic achievement for groups ranging\\nfrom first grade to high school, and representing a wide array of abilities and disabilities. For example, during\\nstudies involving younger students, when children in the study exhibited appropriate behavior (not hitting or\\npinching), they received a “quiet hands” token. When they hit or pinched, they lost a token. The children could\\nthen exchange specified amounts of tokens for minutes of playtime.\\n196 6 • Learning\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nBehavior Modification in Children\\nParents and teachers often use behavior modification to change a child’s behavior. Behavior modification uses\\nthe principles of operant conditioning to accomplish behavior change so that undesirable behaviors are switched\\nfor more socially acceptable ones. Some teachers and parents create a sticker chart, in which several behaviors\\nare listed (Figure 6.11). Sticker charts are a form of token economies, as described in the text. Each time children\\nperform the behavior, they get a sticker, and after a certain number of stickers, they get a prize, or reinforcer. The\\ngoal is to increase acceptable behaviors and decrease misbehavior. Remember, it is best to reinforce desired\\nbehaviors, rather than to use punishment. In the classroom, the teacher can reinforce a wide range of behaviors,\\nfrom students raising their hands, to walking quietly in the hall, to turning in their homework. At home, parents\\nmight create a behavior chart that rewards children for things such as putting away toys, brushing their teeth,\\nand helping with dinner. In order for behavior modification to be effective, the reinforcement needs to be\\nconnected with the behavior; the reinforcement must matter to the child and be done consistently.\\nFIGURE 6.11 Sticker charts are a form of positive reinforcement and a tool for behavior modification. Once this\\nchild earns a certain number of stickers for demonstrating a desired behavior, she will be rewarded with a trip to\\nthe ice cream parlor. (credit: Abigail Batchelder)\\nTime-out is another popular technique used in behavior modification with children. It operates on the principle of\\nnegative punishment. When a child demonstrates an undesirable behavior, they are removed from the desirable\\nactivity at hand (Figure 6.12). For example, say that Sophia and her brother Mario are playing with building\\nblocks. Sophia throws some blocks at her brother, so you give her a warning that she will go to time-out if she\\ndoes it again. A few minutes later, she throws more blocks at Mario. You remove Sophia from the room for a few\\nminutes. When she comes back, she doesn’t throw blocks.\\nThere are several important points that you should know if you plan to implement time-out as a behavior\\nmodification technique. First, make sure the child is being removed from a desirable activity and placed in a less\\ndesirable location. If the activity is something undesirable for the child, this technique will backfire because it is\\nmore enjoyable for the child to be removed from the activity. Second, the length of the time-out is important. The\\ngeneral rule of thumb is one minute for each year of the child’s age. Sophia is five; therefore, she sits in a time-\\nout for five minutes. Setting a timer helps children know how long they have to sit in time-out. Finally, as a\\ncaregiver, keep several guidelines in mind over the course of a time-out: remain calm when directing your child to\\ntime-out; ignore your child during time-out (because caregiver attention may reinforce misbehavior); and give the\\nchild a hug or a kind word when time-out is over.\\nEVERYDAY CONNECTION\\n6.3 • Operant Conditioning 197\\nFIGURE 6.12 Time-out is a popular form of negative punishment used by caregivers. When a child misbehaves,\\nthey are removed from a desirable activity in an effort to decrease the unwanted behavior. For example, (a) a\\nchild might be playing on the playground with friends and push another child; (b) the child who misbehaved\\nwould then be removed from the activity for a short period of time. (credit a: modification of work by Simone\\nRamella; credit b: modification of work by “Spring Dew”/Flickr)\\nReinforcement Schedules\\nRemember, the best way to teach a person or animal a behavior is to use positive reinforcement. For example,\\nSkinner used positive reinforcement to teach rats to press a lever in a Skinner box. At first, the rat might\\nrandomly hit the lever while exploring the box, and out would come a pellet of food. After eating the pellet,\\nwhat do you think the hungry rat did next? It hit the lever again, and received another pellet of food. Each time\\nthe rat hit the lever, a pellet of food came out. When an organism receives a reinforcer each time it displays a\\nbehavior, it is called continuous reinforcement. This reinforcement schedule is the quickest way to teach\\nsomeone a behavior, and it is especially effective in training a new behavior. Let’s look back at the dog that was\\nlearning to sit earlier in the chapter. Now, each time he sits, you give him a treat. Timing is important here: you\\nwill be most successful if you present the reinforcer immediately after he sits, so that he can make an\\nassociation between the target behavior (sitting) and the consequence (getting a treat).\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nWatch this video clip of veterinarian Dr. Sophia Yin shaping a dog\\'s behavior using the steps outlined above\\n(http://openstax.org/l/sueyin) to learn more.\\nOnce a behavior is trained, researchers and trainers often turn to another type of reinforcement\\nschedule—partial reinforcement. In partial reinforcement, also referred to as intermittent reinforcement, the\\nperson or animal does not get reinforced every time they perform the desired behavior. There are several\\ndifferent types of partial reinforcement schedules (Table 6.3). These schedules are described as either fixed or\\nvariable, and as either interval or ratio. Fixed refers to the number of responses between reinforcements, or\\nthe amount of time between reinforcements, which is set and unchanging. Variable refers to the number of\\nresponses or amount of time between reinforcements, which varies or changes. Interval means the schedule is\\nbased on the time between reinforcements, and ratio means the schedule is based on the number of responses\\nbetween reinforcements.\\n198 6 • Learning\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nFIGURE 11.8 Alfred Adler proposed the concept of the inferiority complex.\\nAdler also believed in the importance of social connections, seeing childhood development emerging through\\nsocial development rather than the sexual stages Freud outlined. Adler noted the inter-relatedness of\\nhumanity and the need to work together for the betterment of all. He said, “The happiness of mankind lies in\\nworking together, in living as if each individual had set himself the task of contributing to the common welfare”\\n(Adler, 1964, p. 255) with the main goal of psychology being “to recognize the equal rights and equality of\\nothers” (Adler, 1961, p. 691).\\nWith these ideas, Adler identified three fundamental social tasks that all of us must experience: occupational\\ntasks (careers), societal tasks (friendship), and love tasks (finding an intimate partner for a long-term\\nrelationship). Rather than focus on sexual or aggressive motives for behavior as Freud did, Adler focused on\\nsocial motives. He also emphasized conscious rather than unconscious motivation, since he believed that the\\nthree fundamental social tasks are explicitly known and pursued. That is not to say that Adler did not also\\nbelieve in unconscious processes—he did—but he felt that conscious processes were more important.\\nOne of Adler’s major contributions to personality psychology was the idea that our birth order shapes our\\npersonality. He proposed that older siblings, who start out as the focus of their parents’ attention but must\\nshare that attention once a new child joins the family, compensate by becoming overachievers. The youngest\\nchildren, according to Adler, may be spoiled, leaving the middle child with the opportunity to minimize the\\nnegative dynamics of the youngest and oldest children. Despite popular attention, research has not\\nconclusively confirmed Adler’s hypotheses about birth order.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nOne of Adler’s major contributions to personality psychology was the idea that our birth order shapes our\\npersonality.

It was Anna Freud\\nwho encouraged Erikson to study psychoanalysis. Erikson received his diploma from the Vienna\\nPsychoanalytic Institute in 1933, and as Nazism spread across Europe, he fled the country and immigrated to\\nthe United States that same year. As you learned when you studied lifespan development, Erikson later\\nproposed a psychosocial theory of development, suggesting that an individual’s personality develops\\nthroughout the lifespan—a departure from Freud’s view that personality is fixed in early life. In his theory,\\nErikson emphasized the social relationships that are important at each stage of personality development, in\\ncontrast to Freud’s emphasis on sex. Erikson identified eight stages, each of which represents a conflict or\\ndevelopmental task (Table 11.2). The development of a healthy personality and a sense of competence depend\\non the successful completion of each task.\\n11.3 • Neo-Freudians: Adler, Erikson, Jung, and Horney 369\\nErikson’s Psychosocial Stages of Development\\nStage Age\\n(years)\\nDevelopmental\\nTask Description\\n1 0–1 Trust vs. mistrust Trust (or mistrust) that basic needs, such as nourishment and affection,\\nwill be met\\n2 1–3 Autonomy vs.\\nshame/doubt Sense of independence in many tasks develops\\n3 3–6 Initiative vs. guilt Take initiative on some activities, may develop guilt when success not\\nmet or boundaries overstepped\\n4 7–11 Industry vs.\\ninferiority\\nDevelop self-confidence in abilities when competent or sense of\\ninferiority when not\\n5 12–18 Identity vs.\\nconfusion Experiment with and develop identity and roles\\n6 19–29 Intimacy vs.\\nisolation Establish intimacy and relationships with others\\n7 30–64 Generativity vs.\\nstagnation Contribute to society and be part of a family\\n8 65– Integrity vs.\\ndespair Assess and make sense of life and meaning of contributions\\nTABLE 11.2\\nCarl Jung\\nCarl Jung (Figure 11.9) was a Swiss psychiatrist and protégé of Freud, who later split off from Freud and\\ndeveloped his own theory, which he called analytical psychology. The focus of analytical psychology is on\\nworking to balance opposing forces of conscious and unconscious thought, and experience within one’s\\npersonality. According to Jung, this work is a continuous learning process—mainly occurring in the second half\\nof life—of becoming aware of unconscious elements and integrating them into consciousness.\\n370 11 • Personality\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nFIGURE 11.9 Carl Jung was interested in exploring the collective unconscious.\\nJung’s split from Freud was based on two major disagreements. First, Jung, like Adler and Erikson, did not\\naccept that sexual drive was the primary motivator in a person’s mental life. Second, although Jung agreed\\nwith Freud’s concept of a personal unconscious, he thought it to be incomplete. In addition to the personal\\nunconscious, Jung focused on the collective unconscious.\\nThe collective unconscious is a universal version of the personal unconscious, holding mental patterns, or\\nmemory traces, which are common to all of us (Jung, 1928). These ancestral memories, which Jung called\\narchetypes, are represented by universal themes in various cultures, as expressed through literature, art, and\\ndreams (Jung). Jung said that these themes reflect common experiences of people the world over, such as\\nfacing death, becoming independent, and striving for mastery. Jung (1964) believed that through biology, each\\nperson is handed down the same themes and that the same types of symbols—such as the hero, the maiden,\\nthe sage, and the trickster—are present in the folklore and fairy tales of every culture. In Jung’s view, the task of\\nintegrating these unconscious archetypal aspects of the self is part of the self-realization process in the second\\nhalf of life. With this orientation toward self-realization, Jung parted ways with Freud’s belief that personality is\\ndetermined solely by past events and anticipated the humanistic movement with its emphasis on self-\\nactualization and orientation toward the future.\\nJung also proposed two attitudes or approaches toward life: extroversion and introversion (Jung, 1923) (Table\\n11.3). These ideas are considered Jung’s most important contributions to the field of personality psychology,\\nas almost all models of personality now include these concepts. If you are an extrovert, then you are a person\\nwho is energized by being outgoing and socially oriented: You derive your energy from being around others. If\\nyou are an introvert, then you are a person who may be quiet and reserved, or you may be social, but your\\nenergy is derived from your inner psychic activity. Jung believed a balance between extroversion and\\nintroversion best served the goal of self-realization.\\nIntroverts and Extroverts\\nIntrovert Extrovert\\nEnergized by being alone Energized by being with others\\nTABLE 11.3\\n11.3 • Neo-Freudians: Adler, Erikson, Jung, and Horney 371\\nIntrovert Extrovert\\nAvoids attention Seeks attention\\nSpeaks slowly and softly Speaks quickly and loudly\\nThinks before speaking Thinks out loud\\nStays on one topic Jumps from topic to topic\\nPrefers written communication Prefers verbal communication\\nPays attention easily Distractible\\nCautious Acts first, thinks later\\nTABLE 11.3\\nAnother concept proposed by Jung was the persona, which he referred to as a mask that we adopt. According\\nto Jung, we consciously create this persona; however, it is derived from both our conscious experiences and\\nour collective unconscious. What is the purpose of the persona? Jung believed that it is a compromise between\\nwho we really are (our true self) and what society expects us to be. We hide those parts of ourselves that are not\\naligned with society’s expectations.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nJung’s view of extroverted and introverted types serves as a basis of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI).\\nThis questionnaire describes a person’s degree of introversion versus extroversion, thinking versus feeling,\\nintuition versus sensation, and judging versus perceiving. Take this modified questionnaire based on the MBTI\\n(http://openstax.org/l/myersbriggs) to learn more.\\nAre Archetypes Genetically Based?\\nJung proposed that human responses to archetypes are similar to instinctual responses in animals. One criticism of\\nJung is that there is no evidence that archetypes are biologically based or similar to animal instincts (Roesler, 2012).\\nJung formulated his ideas about 100 years ago, and great advances have been made in the field of genetics since\\nthat time. We’ve found that human babies are born with certain capacities, including the ability to acquire language.\\nHowever, we’ve also found that symbolic information (such as archetypes) is not encoded on the genome and that\\nbabies cannot decode symbolism, refuting the idea of a biological basis to archetypes. Rather than being seen as\\npurely biological, more recent research suggests that archetypes emerge directly from our experiences and are\\nreflections of linguistic or cultural characteristics (Young-Eisendrath, 1995). Today, most Jungian scholars believe\\nthat the collective unconscious and archetypes are based on both innate and environmental influences, with the\\ndifferences being in the role and degree of each (Sotirova-Kohli et al., 2013).\\nKaren Horney\\nKaren Horney was one of the first women trained as a Freudian psychoanalyst. During the Great Depression,\\nHorney moved from Germany to the United States, and subsequently moved away from Freud’s teachings. Like\\nJung, Horney believed that each individual has the potential for self-realization and that the goal of\\npsychoanalysis should be moving toward a healthy self rather than exploring early childhood patterns of\\nCONNECT THE CONCEPTS\\n372 11 • Personality\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\ndysfunction. Horney also disagreed with the Freudian idea that girls have penis envy and are jealous of male\\nbiological features. According to Horney, any jealousy is most likely culturally based, due to the greater\\nprivileges that men often have, meaning that the differences between men’s and women’s personalities are\\nculturally based, not biologically based. She further suggested that men have womb envy, because they cannot\\ngive birth.\\nHorney’s theories focused on the role of unconscious anxiety. She suggested that normal growth can be\\nblocked by basic anxiety stemming from needs not being met, such as childhood experiences of loneliness\\nand/or isolation. How do children learn to handle this anxiety? Horney suggested three styles of coping (Table\\n11.4). The first coping style, moving toward people, relies on affiliation and dependence. These children\\nbecome dependent on their parents and other caregivers in an effort to receive attention and affection, which\\nprovides relief from anxiety (Burger, 2008). When these children grow up, they tend to use this same coping\\nstrategy to deal with relationships, expressing an intense need for love and acceptance (Burger, 2008). The\\nsecond coping style, moving against people, relies on aggression and assertiveness. Children with this coping\\nstyle find that fighting is the best way to deal with an unhappy home situation, and they deal with their feelings\\nof insecurity by bullying other children (Burger, 2008). As adults, people with this coping style tend to lash out\\nwith hurtful comments and exploit others (Burger, 2008).

This illustrates one\\nsignificant advantage of the learning approaches over psychodynamics: Because learning approaches involve\\nobservable, measurable phenomena, they can be scientifically tested.\\n11.4 • Learning Approaches 373\\n', 'answer': 'Answer VERY concisely from the provided context only.

As you watch the video, look closely at Little Albert’s reactions and the manner in which Watson and Rayner present the stimuli before and after conditioning. Based on what you see, would you come to the same conclusions as the researchers? Advertising and Associative Learning Advertising executives are pros at applying the principles of associative learning. Think about the car commercials you have seen on television. Many of them feature an attractive model. By associating the model with the car being advertised, you come to see the car as being desirable (Cialdini, 2008). You may be asking yourself, does this advertising technique actually work? According to Cialdini (2008), men who viewed a car commercial that included an attractive model later rated the car as being faster, more appealing, and better designed than did men who viewed an advertisement for the same car minus the model. Have you ever noticed how quickly advertisers cancel contracts with a famous athlete following a scandal? As far as the advertiser is concerned, that athlete is no longer associated with positive feelings; therefore, the athlete cannot be used as an unconditioned stimulus to condition the public to associate positive feelings (the unconditioned response) with their product (the conditioned stimulus). Now that you are aware of how associative learning works, see if you can find examples of these types of advertisements on television, in magazines, or on the Internet. 6.3 Operant Conditioning LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Define operant conditioning • Explain the difference between reinforcement and punishment • Distinguish between reinforcement schedules The previous section of this chapter focused on the type of associative learning known as classical conditioning. Remember that in classical conditioning, something in the environment triggers a reflex automatically, and researchers train the organism to react to a different stimulus. Now we turn to the second type of associative learning, operant conditioning. In operant conditioning, organisms learn through the application of consequences. For example, if a dog is trained to salivate at the sound of a bell, then the dog will learn that the bell will cause the salivation to occur. This is an example of positive reinforcement. If, on the other hand, a person is taught to drink a glass of orange juice when he or she sees a picture of an orange, then the person will learn the association of the orange picture with the drink. The orange is the conditioned stimulus (CS), and drinking the juice will produce the response (R). The association between the CS and R is referred to as a positive association (PA). In this case, there is a reinforcement schedule (RS) that is used to produce the PA. In the next two sections, we will look at two different schedules of reinforcement: fixed-interval and fixed-ratio. We will also discuss the differences between positive and negative reinforcement, as well as between punishment and positive punishment. Fixed-Ratio Schedules of Reinforcement Reinforcement schedules are divided into two main categories: interval schedules and ratio schedules. Interval schedules are the most common and are also the easiest to understand. An interval schedule is defined as one in which the reinforcement is given at a fixed interval of time after the stimulus is presented. A ratio schedule is defined by the number of times a stimulus must be presented in order to elicit the desired response. The following table shows the two most commonly used intervals and ratios. Interval Schedule Ratio Schedule 1:1 3:2 2:3 4:5 5:4 6:7 7:6 8:9 9:8 In this table, each row represents an interval and each column represents a ratio. You can see that there are several different ratios and intervals that are used in different situations. Let’s take a closer look and see how these schedules work. Suppose you want to increase the frequency of your dog salivating when you give him a treat after he salivates. You can do this by giving him the treat every 5 minutes. Or, suppose you wanted to make sure that every time you give him his treat, he will respond to it. To accomplish this, it would be best to give the treats at fixed intervals of time (e.g., every minute, every hour, etc.). In other words, when the time between treats is fixed (i.e., fixed interval', 'references': '{\"sections\": [\"Learning\", \"Learning/Observational Learning (Modeling)\", \"Personality/Trait Theorists\"], \"pages\": [\"208\", \"206\", \"383\"]}'}\n",

While Wundt and James were\\nconcerned with understanding conscious experience, Watson thought that the study of consciousness was\\nflawed. Because he believed that objective analysis of the mind was impossible, Watson preferred to focus\\ndirectly on observable behavior and try to bring that behavior under control. Watson was a major proponent of\\nshifting the focus of psychology from the mind to behavior, and this approach of observing and controlling\\nbehavior came to be known as behaviorism. A major object of study by behaviorists was learned behavior and\\nits interaction with inborn qualities of the organism. Behaviorism commonly used animals in experiments\\nunder the assumption that what was learned using animal models could, to some degree, be applied to human\\nbehavior. Indeed, Tolman (1938) stated, “I believe that everything important in psychology (except … such\\nmatters as involve society and words) can be investigated in essence through the continued experimental and\\ntheoretical analysis of the determiners of rat behavior at a choice-point in a maze.”\\nFIGURE 1.5 John B. Watson is known as the father of behaviorism within psychology.\\nBehaviorism dominated experimental psychology for several decades, and its influence can still be felt today\\n(Thorne & Henley, 2005). Behaviorism is largely responsible for establishing psychology as a scientific\\ndiscipline through its objective methods and especially experimentation. In addition, it is used in behavioral\\nand cognitive-behavioral therapy. Behavior modification is commonly used in classroom settings. Behaviorism\\nhas also led to research on environmental influences on human behavior.\\nB. F. Skinner (1904–1990) was an American psychologist (Figure 1.6). Like Watson, Skinner was a behaviorist,\\nand he concentrated on how behavior was affected by its consequences. Therefore, Skinner spoke of\\nreinforcement and punishment as major factors in driving behavior. As a part of his research, Skinner\\ndeveloped a chamber that allowed the careful study of the principles of modifying behavior through\\nreinforcement and punishment. This device, known as an operant conditioning chamber (or more familiarly, a\\nSkinner box), has remained a crucial resource for researchers studying behavior (Thorne & Henley, 2005).\\nFIGURE 1.6 (a) B. F. Skinner is famous for his research on operant conditioning. (b) Modified versions of the operant\\nconditioning chamber, or Skinner box, are still widely used in research settings today. (credit a: modification of work\\nby \"Silly rabbit\"/Wikimedia Commons)\\n1.2 • History of Psychology 13\\nThe Skinner box is a chamber that isolates the subject from the external environment and has a behavior\\nindicator such as a lever or a button. When the animal pushes the button or lever, the box is able to deliver a\\npositive reinforcement of the behavior (such as food) or a punishment (such as a noise).\\nSkinner’s focus on positive and negative reinforcement of learned behaviors had a lasting influence in\\npsychology that has waned somewhat since the growth of research in cognitive psychology. Despite this,\\nconditioned learning is still used in human behavioral modification (Greengrass, 2004).\\nMaslow, Rogers, and Humanism\\nDuring the early 20th century, American psychology was dominated by behaviorism and psychoanalysis.\\nHowever, some psychologists were uncomfortable with what they viewed as limited perspectives being so\\ninfluential to the field. They objected to the pessimism and determinism (all actions driven by the\\nunconscious) of Freud. They also disliked the reductionism, or simplifying nature, of behaviorism.\\nBehaviorism is also deterministic at its core, because it sees human behavior as entirely determined by a\\ncombination of genetics and environment. Some psychologists began to form their own ideas that emphasized\\npersonal control, intentionality, and a true predisposition for “good” as important for our self-concept and our\\nbehavior. Thus, humanism emerged. Humanism is a perspective within psychology that emphasizes the\\npotential for good that is innate to all humans. Two of the most well-known proponents of humanistic\\npsychology are Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers (O’Hara, n.d.).\\nAbraham Maslow (1908–1970) was an American psychologist who is best known for proposing a hierarchy of\\nhuman needs in motivating behavior (Figure 1.7). Although this concept will be discussed in more detail in a\\nlater chapter, a brief overview will be provided here. Maslow asserted that so long as basic needs necessary for\\nsurvival were met (e.g., food, water, shelter), higher-level needs (e.g., social needs) would begin to motivate\\nbehavior. According to Maslow, the highest-level needs relate to self-actualization, a process by which we\\nachieve our full potential. Obviously, the focus on the positive aspects of human nature that are characteristic\\nof the humanistic perspective is evident (Thorne & Henley, 2005). Humanistic psychologists rejected, on\\nprinciple, the research approach based on reductionist experimentation in the tradition of the physical and\\nbiological sciences, because it missed the “whole” human being. Beginning with Maslow and Rogers, there was\\nan insistence on a humanistic research program. This program has been largely qualitative (not\\nmeasurement-based), but there exist a number of quantitative research strains within humanistic psychology,\\nincluding research on happiness, self-concept, meditation, and the outcomes of humanistic psychotherapy\\n(Friedman, 2008).\\n14 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nFIGURE 1.7 Maslow’s hierarchy of needs is shown.\\nCarl Rogers (1902–1987) was also an American psychologist who, like Maslow, emphasized the potential for\\ngood that exists within all people (Figure 1.8). Rogers used a therapeutic technique known as client-centered\\ntherapy in helping his clients deal with problematic issues that resulted in their seeking psychotherapy. Unlike\\na psychoanalytic approach in which the therapist plays an important role in interpreting what conscious\\nbehavior reveals about the unconscious mind, client-centered therapy involves the patient taking a lead role in\\nthe therapy session. Rogers believed that a therapist needed to display three features to maximize the\\neffectiveness of this particular approach: unconditional positive regard, genuineness, and empathy.\\nUnconditional positive regard refers to the fact that the therapist accepts their client for who they are, no\\nmatter what they might say. Provided these factors, Rogers believed that people were more than capable of\\ndealing with and working through their own issues (Thorne & Henley, 2005).\\nFIGURE 1.8 Carl Rogers, shown in this portrait, developed a client-centered therapy method that has been\\ninfluential in clinical settings. (credit: \"Didius\"/Wikimedia Commons)\\nHumanism has been influential to psychology as a whole. Both Maslow and Rogers are well-known names\\namong students of psychology (you will read more about both later in this text), and their ideas have influenced\\nmany scholars. Furthermore, Rogers’ client-centered approach to therapy is still commonly used in\\npsychotherapeutic settings today (O’hara, n.d.)\\n1.2 • History of Psychology 15\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nView a brief video of Carl Rogers describing his therapeutic approach (http://openstax.org/l/crogers1) to learn\\nmore.\\nThe Cognitive Revolution\\nBehaviorism’s emphasis on objectivity and focus on external behavior had pulled psychologists’ attention away\\nfrom the mind for a prolonged period of time. The early work of the humanistic psychologists redirected\\nattention to the individual human as a whole, and as a conscious and self-aware being. By the 1950s, new\\ndisciplinary perspectives in linguistics, neuroscience, and computer science were emerging, and these areas\\nrevived interest in the mind as a focus of scientific inquiry. This particular perspective has come to be known\\nas the cognitive revolution (Miller, 2003). By 1967, Ulric Neisser published the first textbook entitled Cognitive\\nPsychology, which served as a core text in cognitive psychology courses around the country (Thorne & Henley,\\n2005).\\nAlthough no one person is entirely responsible for starting the cognitive revolution, Noam Chomsky was very\\ninfluential in the early days of this movement (Figure 1.9). Chomsky (1928–), an American linguist, was\\ndissatisfied with the influence that behaviorism had had on psychology. He believed that psychology’s focus on\\nbehavior was short-sighted and that the field had to re-incorporate mental functioning into its purview if it\\nwere to offer any meaningful contributions to understanding behavior (Miller, 2003).\\nFIGURE 1.9 Noam Chomsky was very influential in beginning the cognitive revolution. In 2010, this mural honoring\\nhim was put up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (credit: Robert Moran)\\nEuropean psychology had never really been as influenced by behaviorism as had American psychology; and\\nthus, the cognitive revolution helped reestablish lines of communication between European psychologists and\\ntheir American counterparts. Furthermore, psychologists began to cooperate with scientists in other fields,\\nlike anthropology, linguistics, computer science, and neuroscience, among others. This interdisciplinary\\napproach often was referred to as the cognitive sciences, and the influence and prominence of this particular\\nperspective resonates in modern-day psychology (Miller, 2003).\\nFeminist Psychology\\nThe science of psychology has had an impact on human wellbeing, both positive and negative. The dominant\\ninfluence of Western, White, and male academics in the early history of psychology meant that psychology\\ndeveloped with the biases inherent in those individuals, which often had negative consequences for members of\\nsociety who were not White or male. Women, members of ethnic minorities in both the United States and other\\ncountries, and individuals with sexual orientations other than straight had difficulties entering the field of\\npsychology and therefore influencing its development. They also suffered from the attitudes of White male\\npsychologists who were not immune to the nonscientific attitudes prevalent in the society in which they\\nDIG DEEPER\\n16 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\ndeveloped and worked. Until the 1960s, the science of psychology was largely a “womanless” psychology\\n(Crawford & Marecek, 1989), meaning that few women were able to practice psychology, so they had little\\ninfluence on what was studied. In addition, the experimental subjects of psychology were mostly men, which\\nresulted from underlying assumptions that gender had no influence on psychology and that women were not of\\nsufficient interest to study.\\nAn article by Naomi Weisstein, first published in 1968 (Weisstein, 1993), stimulated a feminist revolution in\\npsychology by presenting a critique of psychology as a science. She also specifically criticized male psychologists\\nfor constructing the psychology of women entirely out of their own cultural biases and without careful\\nexperimental tests to verify any of their characterizations of women. Weisstein used, as examples, statements by\\nprominent psychologists in the 1960s, such as this quote by Bruno Bettleheim: “We must start with the\\nrealization that, as much as women want to be good scientists or engineers, they want first and foremost to be\\nwomanly companions of men and to be mothers.” Weisstein’s critique formed the foundation for the subsequent\\ndevelopment of a feminist psychology that attempted to be free of the influence of male cultural biases on our\\nknowledge of the psychology of women.\\nCrawford & Marecek (1989) identify several feminist approaches to psychology that can be described as feminist\\npsychology. These include re-evaluating and discovering the contributions of women to the history of psychology,\\nstudying psychological gender differences, and questioning the male bias present across the practice of the\\nscientific approach to knowledge.\\nMulticultural And Cross-Cultural Psychology\\nCulture impacts individuals, groups, and society. An ongoing issue researchers are trying to correct is that\\ncertain populations have been over-studied and the results of these studies have been applied to other\\npopulations. For example, Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan discuss how WEIRD societies have been\\noverstudied and the results have been wrongly applied to non-WEIRD societies (2010). WEIRD stands for\\nwestern, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic. Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan found that there are\\nmany differences between people in the WEIRD group and people in less industrialized, less urban, and non-\\nWestern societies. These differences occur in a variety of areas, including perception, cooperation, and moral\\nreasoning. That is, people vary depending on their culture and environment. Multicultural psychologists\\ndevelop theories and conduct research with diverse populations, typically within one country. Cross-cultural\\npsychologists compare populations across countries, such as participants from the United States compared to\\nparticipants from China.\\nIn 1920, Francis Cecil Sumner was the first African American to receive a PhD in psychology in the United\\nStates. Sumner established a psychology degree program at Howard University, leading to the education of a\\nnew generation of African American psychologists (Black, Spence, and Omari, 2004). Much of the work of early\\npsychologists from diverse backgrounds was dedicated to challenging intelligence testing and promoting\\ninnovative educational methods for children. George I. Sanchez contested such testing with Mexican American\\nchildren. As a psychologist of Mexican heritage, he pointed out that the language and cultural barriers in\\ntesting were keeping children from equal opportunities (Guthrie, 1998). By 1940, he was teaching with his\\ndoctoral degree at University of Texas at Austin and challenging segregated educational practices (Romo,\\n1986).\\nTwo famous African American researchers and psychologists are Mamie Phipps Clark and her husband,\\nKenneth Clark. They are best known for their studies conducted on African American children and doll\\npreference, research that was instrumental in the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court desegregation\\ncase. The Clarks applied their research to social services and opened the first child guidance center in Harlem\\n(American Psychological Association, 2019).\\nListen to the podcast below describing the Clarks\\' research and impact on the Supreme Court decision.\\n1.2 • History of Psychology 17\\nhomeostasis. (credit \"left\": modification of work by \"Gracie and Viv\"/Flickr; credit \"center\": modification of work by\\nSteven Depolo; credit \"right\": modification of work by Monica Renata)\\nExtensions of drive theory take into account levels of arousal as potential motivators. As you recall from your\\nstudy of learning, these theories assert that there is an optimal level of arousal that we all try to maintain\\n(Figure 10.6). If we are underaroused, we become bored and will seek out some sort of stimulation. On the\\nother hand, if we are overaroused, we will engage in behaviors to reduce our arousal (Berlyne, 1960). Most\\nstudents have experienced this need to maintain optimal levels of arousal over the course of their academic\\ncareer. Think about how much stress students experience toward the end of spring semester. They feel\\noverwhelmed with seemingly endless exams, papers, and major assignments that must be completed on time.\\nThey probably yearn for the rest and relaxation that awaits them over the extended summer break. However,\\nonce they finish the semester, it doesn’t take too long before they begin to feel bored. Generally, by the time the\\nnext semester is beginning in the fall, many students are quite happy to return to school. This is an example of\\nhow arousal theory works.\\nFIGURE 10.6 The concept of optimal arousal in relation to performance on a task is depicted here. Performance is\\nmaximized at the optimal level of arousal, and it tapers off during under- and overarousal.\\nSo what is the optimal level of arousal? What level leads to the best performance? Research shows that\\nmoderate arousal is generally best; when arousal is very high or very low, performance tends to suffer (Yerkes\\n& Dodson, 1908). Think of your arousal level regarding taking an exam for this class. If your level is very low,\\nsuch as boredom and apathy, your performance will likely suffer. Similarly, a very high level, such as extreme\\nanxiety, can be paralyzing and hinder performance. Consider the example of a softball team facing a\\ntournament. They are favored to win their first game by a large margin, so they go into the game with a lower\\nlevel of arousal and get beat by a less skilled team.\\nBut optimal arousal level is more complex than a simple answer that the middle level is always best.\\nResearchers Robert Yerkes (pronounced “Yerk-EES”) and John Dodson discovered that the optimal arousal\\nlevel depends on the complexity and difficulty of the task to be performed (Figure 10.7). This relationship is\\nknown as Yerkes-Dodson law, which holds that a simple task is performed best when arousal levels are\\nrelatively high and complex tasks are best performed when arousal levels are lower.\\n10.1 • Motivation 325\\nFIGURE 10.7 Task performance is best when arousal levels are in a middle range, with difficult tasks best\\nperformed under lower levels of arousal and simple tasks best performed under higher levels of arousal.\\nSelf-efficacy and Social Motives\\nSelf-efficacy is an individual’s belief in their own capability to complete a task, which may include a previous\\nsuccessful completion of the exact task or a similar task. Albert Bandura (1994) theorized that an individual’s\\nsense of self-efficacy plays a pivotal role in motivating behavior. Bandura argues that motivation derives from\\nexpectations that we have about the consequences of our behaviors, and ultimately, it is the appreciation of our\\ncapacity to engage in a given behavior that will determine what we do and the future goals that we set for\\nourselves. For example, if you have a sincere belief in your ability to achieve at the highest level, you are more\\nlikely to take on challenging tasks and to not let setbacks dissuade you from seeing the task through to the end.\\nA number of theorists have focused their research on understanding social motives (McAdams & Constantian,\\n1983; McClelland & Liberman, 1949; Murray et al., 1938). Among the motives they describe are needs for\\nachievement, affiliation, and intimacy. It is the need for achievement that drives accomplishment and\\nperformance. The need for affiliation encourages positive interactions with others, and the need for intimacy\\ncauses us to seek deep, meaningful relationships. Henry Murray et al. (1938) categorized these needs into\\ndomains. For example, the need for achievement and recognition falls under the domain of ambition.\\nDominance and aggression were recognized as needs under the domain of human power, and play was a\\nrecognized need in the domain of interpersonal affection.\\nMaslow’s Hierarchy of Needs\\nWhile the theories of motivation described earlier relate to basic biological drives, individual characteristics,\\nor social contexts, Abraham Maslow (1943) proposed a hierarchy of needs that spans the spectrum of motives\\nranging from the biological to the individual to the social. These needs are often depicted as a pyramid (Figure\\n10.8).\\n326 10 • Emotion and Motivation\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nFIGURE 10.8 Maslow’s hierarchy of needs is illustrated here. In some versions of the pyramid, cognitive and\\naesthetic needs are also included between esteem and self-actualization. Others include another tier at the top of\\nthe pyramid for self-transcendence.\\nAt the base of the pyramid are all of the physiological needs that are necessary for survival. These are followed\\nby basic needs for security and safety, the need to be loved and to have a sense of belonging, and the need to\\nhave self-worth and confidence. The top tier of the pyramid is self-actualization, which is a need that\\nessentially equates to achieving one’s full potential, and it can only be realized when needs lower on the\\npyramid have been met. To Maslow and humanistic theorists, self-actualization reflects the humanistic\\nemphasis on positive aspects of human nature. Maslow suggested that this is an ongoing, life-long process and\\nthat only a small percentage of people actually achieve a self-actualized state (Francis & Kritsonis, 2006;\\nMaslow, 1943).\\nAccording to Maslow (1943), one must satisfy lower-level needs before addressing those needs that occur\\nhigher in the pyramid. So, for example, if someone is struggling to find enough food to meet their nutritional\\nrequirements, it is quite unlikely that they would spend an inordinate amount of time thinking about whether\\nothers viewed them as a good person or not. Instead, all of their energies would be geared toward finding\\nsomething to eat. However, it should be pointed out that Maslow’s theory has been criticized for its subjective\\nnature and its inability to account for phenomena that occur in the real world (Leonard, 1982). Other research\\nhas more recently addressed that late in life, Maslow proposed a self-transcendence level above self-\\nactualization—to represent striving for meaning and purpose beyond the concerns of oneself (Koltko-Rivera,\\n2006). For example, people sometimes make self-sacrifices in order to make a political statement or in an\\nattempt to improve the conditions of others. Mohandas K. Gandhi, a world-renowned advocate for\\nindependence through nonviolent protest, on several occasions went on hunger strikes to protest a particular\\nsituation. People may starve themselves or otherwise put themselves in danger displaying higher-level\\nmotives beyond their own needs.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nCheck out this interactive exercise about Maslow\\'s hierarchy of needs (http://openstax.org/l/hierneeds) to learn\\nmore.\\n10.1 • Motivation 327\\n10.2 Hunger and Eating\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Describe how hunger and eating are regulated\\n• Differentiate between levels of overweight and obesity and the associated health consequences\\n• Explain the health consequences resulting from anorexia and bulimia nervosa\\nEating is essential for survival, and it is no surprise that a drive like hunger exists to ensure that we seek out\\nsustenance. While this chapter will focus primarily on the physiological mechanisms that regulate hunger and\\neating, powerful social, cultural, and economic influences also play important roles. This section will explain\\nthe regulation of hunger, eating, and body weight, and we will discuss the adverse consequences of disordered\\neating.\\nPhysiological Mechanisms\\nThere are a number of physiological mechanisms that serve as the basis for hunger. When our stomachs are\\nempty, they contract. Typically, a person then experiences hunger pangs. Chemical messages travel to the\\nbrain, and serve as a signal to initiate feeding behavior. When our blood glucose levels drop, the pancreas and\\nliver generate a number of chemical signals that induce hunger (Konturek et al., 2003; Novin, Robinson,\\nCulbreth, & Tordoff, 1985) and thus initiate feeding behavior.\\nFor most people, once they have eaten, they feel satiation, or fullness and satisfaction, and their eating\\nbehavior stops. Like the initiation of eating, satiation is also regulated by several physiological mechanisms. As\\nblood glucose levels increase, the pancreas and liver send signals to shut off hunger and eating (Drazen &\\nWoods, 2003; Druce, Small, & Bloom, 2004; Greary, 1990). The food’s passage through the gastrointestinal\\ntract also provides important satiety signals to the brain (Woods, 2004), and fat cells release leptin, a satiety\\nhormone.\\nThe various hunger and satiety signals that are involved in the regulation of eating are integrated in the brain.\\nResearch suggests that several areas of the hypothalamus and hindbrain are especially important sites where\\nthis integration occurs (Ahima & Antwi, 2008; Woods & D’Alessio, 2008). Ultimately, activity in the brain\\ndetermines whether or not we engage in feeding behavior (Figure 10.9).\\n328 10 • Emotion and Motivation\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nFIGURE 10.9 Hunger and eating are regulated by a complex interplay of hunger and satiety signals that are\\nintegrated in the brain.\\nMetabolism and Body Weight\\nOur body weight is affected by a number of factors, including gene-environment interactions, and the number\\nof calories we consume versus the number of calories we burn in daily activity. If our caloric intake exceeds\\nour caloric use, our bodies store excess energy in the form of fat. If we consume fewer calories than we burn\\noff, then stored fat will be converted to energy. Our energy expenditure is obviously affected by our levels of\\nactivity, but our body’s metabolic rate also comes into play. A person’s metabolic rate is the amount of energy\\nthat is expended in a given period of time, and there is tremendous individual variability in our metabolic\\nrates. People with high rates of metabolism are able to burn off calories more easily than those with lower rates\\nof metabolism.\\nWe all experience fluctuations in our weight from time to time, but generally, most people’s weights fluctuate\\nwithin a narrow margin, in the absence of extreme changes in diet and/or physical activity. This observation\\nled some to propose a set-point theory of body weight regulation. The set-point theory asserts that each\\nindividual has an ideal body weight, or set point, which is resistant to change. This set-point is genetically\\npredetermined and efforts to move our weight significantly from the set-point are resisted by compensatory\\nchanges in energy intake and/or expenditure (Speakman et al., 2011).\\nSome of the predictions generated from this particular theory have not received empirical support. For\\nexample, there are no changes in metabolic rate between individuals who had recently lost significant\\namounts of weight and a control group (Weinsier et al., 2000). In addition, the set-point theory fails to account\\nfor the influence of social and environmental factors in the regulation of body weight (Martin-Gronert &\\nOzanne, 2013; Speakman et al., 2011). Despite these limitations, set-point theory is still often used as a simple,\\nintuitive explanation of how body weight is regulated. See Psychological Disorders for further discussion about\\neating disorders.\\nObesity\\nWhen someone weighs more than what is generally accepted as healthy for a given height, they are considered\\noverweight or obese. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an adult with a body\\n10.2 • Hunger and Eating 329\\ninclude your beliefs and values, and your past experiences with similar behaviors. Finally, context refers to the\\nreward structure for the behavior. According to reciprocal determinism, all of these factors are in play.\\nObservational Learning\\nBandura’s key contribution to learning theory was the idea that much learning is vicarious. We learn by\\nobserving someone else’s behavior and its consequences, which Bandura called observational learning. He felt\\nthat this type of learning also plays a part in the development of our personality. Just as we learn individual\\nbehaviors, we learn new behavior patterns when we see them performed by other people or models. Drawing\\non the behaviorists’ ideas about reinforcement, Bandura suggested that whether we choose to imitate a\\nmodel’s behavior depends on whether we see the model reinforced or punished. Through observational\\nlearning, we come to learn what behaviors are acceptable and rewarded in our culture, and we also learn to\\ninhibit deviant or socially unacceptable behaviors by seeing what behaviors are punished.\\nWe can see the principles of reciprocal determinism at work in observational learning. For example, personal\\nfactors determine which behaviors in the environment a person chooses to imitate, and those environmental\\nevents in turn are processed cognitively according to other personal factors. One person may experience\\nreceiving attention as reinforcing, and that person may be more inclined to imitate behaviors such as boasting\\nwhen a model has been reinforced. For others, boasting may be viewed negatively, despite the attention that\\nmight result—or receiving heightened attention may be perceived as being scrutinized. In either case, the\\nperson may be less likely to imitate those behaviors even though the reasons for not doing so would be\\ndifferent.\\nSelf-Efficacy\\nBandura (1977, 1995) has studied a number of cognitive and personal factors that affect learning and\\npersonality development, and most recently has focused on the concept of self-efficacy. Self-efficacy is our\\nlevel of confidence in our own abilities, developed through our social experiences. Self-efficacy affects how we\\napproach challenges and reach goals. In observational learning, self-efficacy is a cognitive factor that affects\\nwhich behaviors we choose to imitate as well as our success in performing those behaviors.\\nPeople who have high self-efficacy believe that their goals are within reach, have a positive view of challenges\\nseeing them as tasks to be mastered, develop a deep interest in and strong commitment to the activities in\\nwhich they are involved, and quickly recover from setbacks. Conversely, people with low self-efficacy avoid\\nchallenging tasks because they doubt their ability to be successful, tend to focus on failure and negative\\noutcomes, and lose confidence in their abilities if they experience setbacks. Feelings of self-efficacy can be\\nspecific to certain situations. For instance, a student might feel confident in her ability in English class but\\nmuch less so in math class.\\nJulian Rotter and Locus of Control\\nJulian Rotter (1966) proposed the concept of locus of control, another cognitive factor that affects learning and\\npersonality development. Distinct from self-efficacy, which involves our belief in our own abilities, locus of\\ncontrol refers to our beliefs about the power we have over our lives. In Rotter’s view, people possess either an\\ninternal or an external locus of control (Figure 11.11). Those of us with an internal locus of control (“internals”)\\ntend to believe that most of our outcomes are the direct result of our efforts. Those of us with an external locus\\nof control (“externals”) tend to believe that our outcomes are outside of our control. Externals see their lives as\\nbeing controlled by other people, luck, or chance. For example, say you didn’t spend much time studying for\\nyour psychology test and went out to dinner with friends instead. When you receive your test score, you see\\nthat you earned a D. If you possess an internal locus of control, you would most likely admit that you failed\\nbecause you didn’t spend enough time studying and decide to study more for the next test. On the other hand,\\nif you possess an external locus of control, you might conclude that the test was too hard and not bother\\nstudying for the next test, because you figure you will fail it anyway. Researchers have found that people with\\nan internal locus of control perform better academically, achieve more in their careers, are more independent,\\n11.4 • Learning Approaches 375\\nare healthier, are better able to cope, and are less depressed than people who have an external locus of control\\n(Benassi, Sweeney, & Durfour, 1988; Lefcourt, 1982; Maltby, Day, & Macaskill, 2007; Whyte, 1977, 1978, 1980).\\nFIGURE 11.11 Locus of control occurs on a continuum from internal to external.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nVisit this web page describing Locus of Control (http://openstax.org/l/locuscontrol) to learn more.\\nWalter Mischel and the Person-Situation Debate\\nWalter Mischel was a student of Julian Rotter and taught for years at Stanford, where he was a colleague of\\nAlbert Bandura. Mischel surveyed several decades of empirical psychological literature regarding trait\\nprediction of behavior, and his conclusion shook the foundations of personality psychology. Mischel found that\\nthe data did not support the central principle of the field—that a person’s personality traits are consistent\\nacross situations. His report triggered a decades-long period of self-examination, known as the person-\\nsituation debate, among personality psychologists.\\nMischel suggested that perhaps we were looking for consistency in the wrong places. He found that although\\nbehavior was inconsistent across different situations, it was much more consistent within situations—so that a\\nperson’s behavior in one situation would likely be repeated in a similar one. And as you will see next regarding\\nhis famous “marshmallow test,” Mischel also found that behavior is consistent in equivalent situations across\\ntime.\\nOne of Mischel’s most notable contributions to personality psychology was his ideas on self-regulation.\\nAccording to Lecci & Magnavita (2013), “Self-regulation is the process of identifying a goal or set of goals and,\\nin pursuing these goals, using both internal (e.g., thoughts and affect) and external (e.g., responses of anything\\nor anyone in the environment) feedback to maximize goal attainment” (p. 6.3). Self-regulation is also known as\\nwill power. When we talk about will power, we tend to think of it as the ability to delay gratification. For\\nexample, Bettina’s teenage son made strawberry cupcakes, and they looked delicious. However, Bettina\\nforfeited the pleasure of eating one, because she is training for a 5K race and wants to be fit and do well in the\\nrace. Would you be able to resist getting a small reward now in order to get a larger reward later? This is the\\nquestion Mischel investigated in his now-classic marshmallow test.\\nMischel designed a study to assess self-regulation in young children. In the marshmallow study, Mischel and\\nhis colleagues placed a preschool child in a room with one marshmallow on the table. The children were told\\nthey could either eat the marshmallow now, or wait until the researcher returned to the room, and then they\\ncould have two marshmallows (Mischel, Ebbesen & Raskoff, 1972). This was repeated with hundreds of\\npreschoolers. What Mischel and his team found was that young children differ in their degree of self-control.\\nMischel and his colleagues continued to follow this group of preschoolers through high school, and what do\\nyou think they discovered? The children who had more self-control in preschool (the ones who waited for the\\nbigger reward) were more successful in high school. They had higher SAT scores, had positive peer\\nrelationships, and were less likely to have substance abuse issues; as adults, they also had more stable\\nmarriages (Mischel, Shoda, & Rodriguez, 1989; Mischel et al., 2010). On the other hand, those children who had\\npoor self-control in preschool (the ones who grabbed the one marshmallow) were not as successful in high\\nschool, and they were found to have academic and behavioral problems. A more recent study using a larger\\nand more representative sample found associations between early delay of gratification (Watts, Duncan, &\\n376 11 • Personality\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nQuan, 2018) and measures of achievement in adolescence. However, researchers also found that the\\nassociations were not as strong as those reported during Mischel\\'s initial experiment and were quite sensitive\\nto situational factors such as early measures of cognitive capacity, family background, and home environment.\\nThis research suggests that consideration of situational factors is important to better understand behavior.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nWatch Joachim de Posada\\'s TEDTalk about the marshmallow test (http://openstax.org/l/TEDPosada) to learn\\nmore and to see the test given to children in Colombia.\\nToday, the debate is mostly resolved, and most psychologists consider both the situation and personal factors\\nin understanding behavior. For Mischel (1993), people are situation processors. The children in the\\nmarshmallow test each processed, or interpreted, the rewards structure of that situation in their own way.\\nMischel’s approach to personality stresses the importance of both the situation and the way the person\\nperceives the situation. Instead of behavior being determined by the situation, people use cognitive processes\\nto interpret the situation and then behave in accordance with that interpretation.\\n11.5 Humanistic Approaches\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Discuss the contributions of Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers to personality development\\nAs the “third force” in psychology, humanism is touted as a reaction both to the pessimistic determinism of\\npsychoanalysis, with its emphasis on psychological disturbance, and to the behaviorists’ view of humans\\npassively reacting to the environment, which has been criticized as making people out to be personality-less\\nrobots. It does not suggest that psychoanalytic, behaviorist, and other points of view are incorrect but argues\\nthat these perspectives do not recognize the depth and meaning of human experience, and fail to recognize the\\ninnate capacity for self-directed change and transforming personal experiences. This perspective focuses on\\nhow healthy people develop. One pioneering humanist, Abraham Maslow, studied people who he considered to\\nbe healthy, creative, and productive, including Albert Einstein, Eleanor Roosevelt, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham\\nLincoln, and others. Maslow (1950, 1970) found that such people share similar characteristics, such as being\\nopen, creative, loving, spontaneous, compassionate, concerned for others, and accepting of themselves. When\\nyou studied motivation, you learned about one of the best-known humanistic theories, Maslow\\'s hierarchy of\\nneeds theory, in which Maslow proposes that human beings have certain needs in common and that these\\nneeds must be met in a certain order. The highest need is the need for self-actualization, which is the\\nachievement of our fullest potential. Maslow differentiated between needs that motivate us to fulfill something\\nthat is missing and needs that inspire us to grow. He believed that many emotional and behavioral concerns\\narise as a result of failing to meet these hierarchical needs.\\nAnother humanistic theorist was Carl Rogers. One of Rogers’s main ideas about personality regards self-\\nconcept, our thoughts and feelings about ourselves. How would you respond to the question, “Who am I?” Your\\nanswer can show how you see yourself. If your response is primarily positive, then you tend to feel good about\\nwho you are, and you see the world as a safe and positive place. If your response is mainly negative, then you\\nmay feel unhappy with who you are. Rogers further divided the self into two categories: the ideal self and the\\nreal self. The ideal self is the person that you would like to be; the real self is the person you actually are.\\nRogers focused on the idea that we need to achieve consistency between these two selves. We experience\\ncongruence when our thoughts about our real self and ideal self are very similar—in other words, when our\\nself-concept is accurate. High congruence leads to a greater sense of self-worth and a healthy, productive life.\\nParents can help their children achieve this by giving them unconditional positive regard, or unconditional\\nlove. According to Rogers (1980), “As persons are accepted and prized, they tend to develop a more caring\\nattitude towards themselves” (p. 116). Conversely, when there is a great discrepancy between our ideal and\\n11.5 • Humanistic Approaches 377\\nactual selves, we experience a state Rogers called incongruence, which can lead to maladjustment. Both\\nRogers’s and Maslow’s theories focus on individual choices and do not believe that biology is deterministic.\\n11.6 Biological Approaches\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Discuss the findings of the Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart as they relate to personality and genetics\\n• Discuss temperament and describe the three infant temperaments identified by Thomas and Chess\\n• Discuss the evolutionary perspective on personality development\\nHow much of our personality is in-born and biological, and how much is influenced by the environment and\\nculture we are raised in? Psychologists who favor the biological approach believe that inherited\\npredispositions as well as physiological processes can be used to explain differences in our personalities\\n(Burger, 2008).\\nEvolutionary psychology relative to personality development looks at personality traits that are universal, as\\nwell as differences across individuals. In this view, adaptive differences have evolved and then provide a\\nsurvival and reproductive advantage. Individual differences are important from an evolutionary viewpoint for\\nseveral reasons. Certain individual differences, and the heritability of these characteristics, have been well\\ndocumented. David Buss has identified several theories to explore this relationship between personality traits\\nand evolution, such as life-history theory, which looks at how people expend their time and energy (such as on\\nbodily growth and maintenance, reproduction, or parenting). Another example is costly signaling theory,\\nwhich examines the honesty and deception in the signals people send one another about their quality as a\\nmate or friend (Buss, 2009).\\nIn the field of behavioral genetics, the Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart—a well-known study of the\\ngenetic basis for personality—conducted research with twins from 1979 to 1999. In studying 350 pairs of\\ntwins, including pairs of identical and fraternal twins reared together and apart, researchers found that\\nidentical twins, whether raised together or apart, have very similar personalities (Bouchard, 1994; Bouchard,\\nLykken, McGue, Segal, & Tellegen, 1990; Segal, 2012). These findings suggest the heritability of some\\npersonality traits. Heritability refers to the proportion of difference among people that is attributed to\\ngenetics. Some of the traits that the study reported as having more than a 0.50 heritability ratio include\\nleadership, obedience to authority, a sense of well-being, alienation, resistance to stress, and fearfulness. The\\nimplication is that some aspects of our personalities are largely controlled by genetics; however, it’s important\\nto point out that traits are not determined by a single gene, but by a combination of many genes, as well as by\\nepigenetic factors that control whether the genes are expressed.\\nOther research that has examined the link between personality and other factors has identified and studied\\nType A and Type B personalities, which you will learn more about in the chapter on Stress, Health, and\\nLifestyle.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nWatch this video about genetic makeup\\'s influence on personality (http://openstax.org/l/persondna) to learn\\nmore.\\nTemperament\\nMost contemporary psychologists believe temperament has a biological basis due to its appearance very early\\nin our lives (Rothbart, 2011). As you learned when you studied lifespan development, Thomas and Chess\\n(1977) found that babies could be categorized into one of three temperaments: easy, difficult, or slow to warm\\nup. However, environmental factors (family interactions, for example) and maturation can affect the ways in\\nwhich children’s personalities are expressed (Carter et al., 2008).\\n378 11 • Personality\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nResearch suggests that there are two dimensions of our temperament that are important parts of our adult\\npersonality—reactivity and self-regulation (Rothbart, Ahadi, & Evans, 2000). Reactivity refers to how we\\nrespond to new or challenging environmental stimuli; self-regulation refers to our ability to control that\\nresponse (Rothbart & Derryberry, 1981; Rothbart, Sheese, Rueda, & Posner, 2011). For example, one person\\nmay immediately respond to new stimuli with a high level of anxiety, while another barely notices it.\\n11.7 Trait Theorists\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Discuss early trait theories of Cattell and Eysenck\\n• Discuss the Big Five factors and describe someone who is high and low on each of the five factors\\nTrait theorists believe personality can be understood via the approach that all people have certain traits, or\\ncharacteristic ways of behaving. Do you tend to be sociable or shy? Passive or aggressive? Optimistic or\\npessimistic? Moody or even-tempered? Early trait theorists tried to describe all human personality traits. For\\nexample, one trait theorist, Gordon Allport (Allport & Odbert, 1936), found 4,500 words in the English language\\nthat could describe people. He organized these personality traits into three categories: cardinal traits, central\\ntraits, and secondary traits. A cardinal trait is one that dominates your entire personality, and hence your\\nlife—such as Ebenezer Scrooge’s greed and Mother Theresa’s altruism. Cardinal traits are not very common:\\nFew people have personalities dominated by a single trait. Instead, our personalities typically are composed of\\nmultiple traits. Central traits are those that make up our personalities (such as loyal, kind, agreeable, friendly,\\nsneaky, wild, and grouchy). Secondary traits are those that are not quite as obvious or as consistent as central\\ntraits. They are present under specific circumstances and include preferences and attitudes. For example, one\\nperson gets angry when people try to tickle him; another can only sleep on the left side of the bed; and yet\\nanother always orders her salad dressing on the side. And you—although not normally an anxious person—feel\\nnervous before making a speech in front of your English class.\\nIn an effort to make the list of traits more manageable, Raymond Cattell (1946, 1957) narrowed down the list to\\nabout 171 traits. However, saying that a trait is either present or absent does not accurately reflect a person’s\\nuniqueness, because all of our personalities are actually made up of the same traits; we differ only in the\\ndegree to which each trait is expressed. Cattell (1957) identified 16 factors or dimensions of personality:\\nwarmth, reasoning, emotional stability, dominance, liveliness, rule-consciousness, social boldness, sensitivity,\\nvigilance, abstractedness, privateness, apprehension, openness to change, self-reliance, perfectionism, and\\ntension (Table 11.5). He developed a personality assessment based on these 16 factors, called the 16PF.\\nInstead of a trait being present or absent, each dimension is scored over a continuum, from high to low. For\\nexample, your level of warmth describes how warm, caring, and nice to others you are. If you score low on this\\nindex, you tend to be more distant and cold. A high score on this index signifies you are supportive and\\ncomforting.\\nPersonality Factors Measured by the 16PF Questionnaire\\nFactor Low Score High Score\\nWarmth Reserved, detached Outgoing, supportive\\nIntellect Concrete thinker Analytical\\nEmotional stability Moody, irritable Stable, calm\\nAggressiveness Docile, submissive Controlling, dominant\\nTABLE 11.5\\n11.7 • Trait Theorists 379\\n', 'answer': 'Answer VERY concisely from the provided context only.

While Wundt and James were concerned with understanding conscious experience, Watson thought that the study of consciousness was flawed. Because he believed that objective analysis of the mind was impossible, Watson preferred to focus directly on observable behavior and try to bring that behavior under control. Watson was a major proponent of shifting the focus of psychology from the mind to behavior, and this approach of observing and controlling behavior came to be known as behaviorism. A major object of study by behaviorists was learned behavior and its interaction with inborn qualities of the organism. Behaviorism commonly used animals in experiments under the assumption that what was learned using animal models could, to some degree, be applied to human behavior. Indeed, Tolman (1938) stated, “I believe that everything important in psychology (except … such matters as involve society and words) can be investigated in essence through the continued experimental and theoretical analysis of the determiners of rat behavior at a choice-point in a maze.” FIGURE 1.5 John B. Watson is known as the father of behaviorism within psychology. Behaviorism dominated experimental psychology for several decades, and its influence can still be felt today (Thorne & Henley, 2005). Behaviorism is largely responsible for establishing psychology as a scientific discipline through its objective methods and especially experimentation. In addition, it is used in behavioral and cognitive-behavioral therapy. Behavior modification is commonly used in classroom settings. Behaviorism has also led to research on environmental influences on human behavior. B. F. Skinner (1904–1990) was an American psychologist (Figure 1.6). Like Watson, Skinner was a behaviorist, and he concentrated on how behavior was affected by its consequences. Therefore, Skinner spoke of reinforcement and punishment as major factors in driving behavior. As a part of his research, Skinner developed a chamber that allowed the careful study of the principles of modifying behavior through reinforcement and punishment. This device, known as an operant conditioning chamber (or more familiarly, a Skinner box), has remained a popular tool for studying the effects of punishment and reinforcement on behaviors. The Skinner box has been used to study a wide range of behaviors, including learning, memory, problem solving, decision making, fear, anxiety, aggression, addiction, self-control, learning disabilities, learning disabilities, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and many others. It has also been used in the development of behavioral therapies, such as aversion therapy and systematic desensitization. Figure 1. 6 B. F.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a form of psychotherapy that aims to help people change their thoughts and behaviors in order to improve their lives. CBT is based on the principles of humanistic psychology, which emphasize the importance of self-awareness and personal responsibility in achieving personal growth and self-fulfillment. According to the American Psychological Association (APA), the primary goal of cognitive behavior therapy is to enable clients to identify and change unhealthy thought patterns and beliefs that interfere with their ability to achieve their goals and live healthy, fulfilling lives (American Psychological Association, n.d., p. 3).

(credit a: modification of work\\nby \"Silly rabbit\"/Wikimedia Commons)\\n1.2 • History of Psychology 13\\nThe Skinner box is a chamber that isolates the subject from the external environment and has a behavior\\nindicator such as a lever or a button. When the animal pushes the button or lever, the box is able to deliver a\\npositive reinforcement of the behavior (such as food) or a punishment (such as a noise).\\nSkinner’s focus on positive and negative reinforcement of learned behaviors had a lasting influence in\\npsychology that has waned somewhat since the growth of research in cognitive psychology. Despite this,\\nconditioned learning is still used in human behavioral modification (Greengrass, 2004).\\nMaslow, Rogers, and Humanism\\nDuring the early 20th century, American psychology was dominated by behaviorism and psychoanalysis.\\nHowever, some psychologists were uncomfortable with what they viewed as limited perspectives being so\\ninfluential to the field. They objected to the pessimism and determinism (all actions driven by the\\nunconscious) of Freud. They also disliked the reductionism, or simplifying nature, of behaviorism.\\nBehaviorism is also deterministic at its core, because it sees human behavior as entirely determined by a\\ncombination of genetics and environment. Some psychologists began to form their own ideas that emphasized\\npersonal control, intentionality, and a true predisposition for “good” as important for our self-concept and our\\nbehavior. Thus, humanism emerged. Humanism is a perspective within psychology that emphasizes the\\npotential for good that is innate to all humans. Two of the most well-known proponents of humanistic\\npsychology are Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers (O’Hara, n.d.).\\nAbraham Maslow (1908–1970) was an American psychologist who is best known for proposing a hierarchy of\\nhuman needs in motivating behavior (Figure 1.7). Although this concept will be discussed in more detail in a\\nlater chapter, a brief overview will be provided here. Maslow asserted that so long as basic needs necessary for\\nsurvival were met (e.g., food, water, shelter), higher-level needs (e.g., social needs) would begin to motivate\\nbehavior. According to Maslow, the highest-level needs relate to self-actualization, a process by which we\\nachieve our full potential. Obviously, the focus on the positive aspects of human nature that are characteristic\\nof the humanistic perspective is evident (Thorne & Henley, 2005). Humanistic psychologists rejected, on\\nprinciple, the research approach based on reductionist experimentation in the tradition of the physical and\\nbiological sciences, because it missed the “whole” human being. Beginning with Maslow and Rogers, there was\\nan insistence on a humanistic research program. This program has been largely qualitative (not\\nmeasurement-based), but there exist a number of quantitative research strains within humanistic psychology,\\nincluding research on happiness, self-concept, meditation, and the outcomes of humanistic psychotherapy\\n(Friedman, 2008).\\n14 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nFIGURE 1.7 Maslow’s hierarchy of needs is shown.\\nCarl Rogers (1902–1987) was also an American psychologist who, like Maslow, emphasized the potential for\\ngood that exists within all people (Figure 1.8). Rogers used a therapeutic technique known as client-centered\\ntherapy in helping his clients deal with problematic issues that resulted in their seeking psychotherapy. Unlike\\na psychoanalytic approach in which the therapist plays an important role in interpreting what conscious\\nbehavior reveals about the unconscious mind, client-centered therapy involves the patient taking a lead role in\\nthe therapy session. Rogers believed that a therapist needed to display three features to maximize the\\neffectiveness of this particular approach: unconditional positive regard, genuineness, and empathy.\\nUnconditional positive regard refers to the fact that the therapist accepts their client for who they are, no\\nmatter what they might say. Provided these factors, Rogers believed that people were more than capable of\\ndealing with and working through their own issues (Thorne & Henley, 2005).\\nFIGURE 1.8 Carl Rogers, shown in this portrait, developed a client-centered therapy method that has been\\ninfluential in clinical settings. (credit: \"Didius\"/Wikimedia Commons)\\nHumanism has been influential to psychology as a whole. Both Maslow and Rogers are well-known names\\namong students of psychology (you will read more about both later in this text), and their ideas have influenced\\nmany scholars. Furthermore, Rogers’ client-centered approach to therapy is still commonly used in\\npsychotherapeutic settings today (O’hara, n.d.)\\n1.2 • History of Psychology 15\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nView a brief video of Carl Rogers describing his therapeutic approach (http://openstax.org/l/crogers1) to learn\\nmore.\\nThe Cognitive Revolution\\nBehaviorism’s emphasis on objectivity and focus on external behavior had pulled psychologists’ attention away\\nfrom the mind for a prolonged period of time. The early work of the humanistic psychologists redirected\\nattention to the individual human as a whole, and as a conscious and self-aware being. By the 1950s, new\\ndisciplinary perspectives in linguistics, neuroscience, and computer science were emerging, and these areas\\nrevived interest in the mind as a focus of scientific inquiry. This particular perspective has come to be known\\nas the cognitive revolution (Miller, 2003). By 1967, Ulric Neisser published the first textbook entitled Cognitive\\nPsychology, which served as a core text in cognitive psychology courses around the country (Thorne & Henley,\\n2005).\\nAlthough no one person is entirely responsible for starting the cognitive revolution, Noam Chomsky was very\\ninfluential in the early days of this movement (Figure 1.9). Chomsky (1928–), an American linguist, was\\ndissatisfied with the influence that behaviorism had had on psychology. He believed that psychology’s focus on\\nbehavior was short-sighted and that the field had to re-incorporate mental functioning into its purview if it\\nwere to offer any meaningful contributions to understanding behavior (Miller, 2003).\\nFIGURE 1.9 Noam Chomsky was very influential in beginning the cognitive revolution. In 2010, this mural honoring\\nhim was put up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (credit: Robert Moran)\\nEuropean psychology had never really been as influenced by behaviorism as had American psychology; and\\nthus, the cognitive revolution helped reestablish lines of communication between European psychologists and\\ntheir American counterparts. Furthermore, psychologists began to cooperate with scientists in other fields,\\nlike anthropology, linguistics, computer science, and neuroscience, among others. This interdisciplinary\\napproach often was referred to as the cognitive sciences, and the influence and prominence of this particular\\nperspective resonates in modern-day psychology (Miller, 2003).\\nFeminist Psychology\\nThe science of psychology has had an impact on human wellbeing, both positive and negative. The dominant\\ninfluence of Western, White, and male academics in the early history of psychology meant that psychology\\ndeveloped with the biases inherent in those individuals, which often had negative consequences for members of\\nsociety who were not White or male. Women, members of ethnic minorities in both the United States and other\\ncountries, and individuals with sexual orientations other than straight had difficulties entering the field of\\npsychology and therefore influencing its development. They also suffered from the attitudes of White male\\npsychologists who were not immune to the nonscientific attitudes prevalent in the society in which they\\nDIG DEEPER\\n16 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\ndeveloped and worked. Until the 1960s, the science of psychology was largely a “womanless” psychology\\n(Crawford & Marecek, 1989), meaning that few women were able to practice psychology, so they had little\\ninfluence on what was studied. In addition, the experimental subjects of psychology were mostly men, which\\nresulted from underlying assumptions that gender had no influence on psychology and that women were not of\\nsufficient interest to study.\\nAn article by Naomi Weisstein, first published in 1968 (Weisstein, 1993), stimulated a feminist revolution in\\npsychology by presenting a critique of psychology as a science. She also specifically criticized male psychologists\\nfor constructing the psychology of women entirely out of their own cultural biases and without careful\\nexperimental tests to verify any of their characterizations of women. Weisstein used, as examples, statements by\\nprominent psychologists in the 1960s, such as this quote by Bruno Bettleheim: “We must start with the\\nrealization that, as much as women want to be good scientists or engineers, they want first and foremost to be\\nwomanly companions of men and to be mothers.” Weisstein’s critique formed the foundation for the subsequent\\ndevelopment of a feminist psychology that attempted to be free of the influence of male cultural biases on our\\nknowledge of the psychology of women.\\nCrawford & Marecek (1989) identify several feminist approaches to psychology that can be described as feminist\\npsychology. These include re-evaluating and discovering the contributions of women to the history of psychology,\\nstudying psychological gender differences, and questioning the male bias present across the practice of the\\nscientific approach to knowledge.\\nMulticultural And Cross-Cultural Psychology\\nCulture impacts individuals, groups, and society. An ongoing issue researchers are trying to correct is that\\ncertain populations have been over-studied and the results of these studies have been applied to other\\npopulations. For example, Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan discuss how WEIRD societies have been\\noverstudied and the results have been wrongly applied to non-WEIRD societies (2010). WEIRD stands for\\nwestern, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic. Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan found that there are\\nmany differences between people in the WEIRD group and people in less industrialized, less urban, and non-\\nWestern societies. These differences occur in a variety of areas, including perception, cooperation, and moral\\nreasoning. That is, people vary depending on their culture and environment. Multicultural psychologists\\ndevelop theories and conduct research with diverse populations, typically within one country. Cross-cultural\\npsychologists compare populations across countries, such as participants from the United States compared to\\nparticipants from China.\\nIn 1920, Francis Cecil Sumner was the first African American to receive a PhD in psychology in the United\\nStates. Sumner established a psychology degree program at Howard University, leading to the education of a\\nnew generation of African American psychologists (Black, Spence, and Omari, 2004). Much of the work of early\\npsychologists from diverse backgrounds was dedicated to challenging intelligence testing and promoting\\ninnovative educational methods for children. George I. Sanchez contested such testing with Mexican American\\nchildren. As a psychologist of Mexican heritage, he pointed out that the language and cultural barriers in\\ntesting were keeping children from equal opportunities (Guthrie, 1998). By 1940, he was teaching with his\\ndoctoral degree at University of Texas at Austin and challenging segregated educational practices (Romo,\\n1986).\\nTwo famous African American researchers and psychologists are Mamie Phipps Clark and her husband,\\nKenneth Clark. They are best known for their studies conducted on African American children and doll\\npreference, research that was instrumental in the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court desegregation\\ncase. The Clarks applied their research to social services and opened the first child guidance center in Harlem\\n(American Psychological Association, 2019).\\nListen to the podcast below describing the Clarks\\' research and impact on the Supreme Court decision.\\n1.2 • History of Psychology 17\\n', 'answer': 'Answer VERY concisely from the provided context only.

While Wundt and James were concerned with understanding conscious experience, Watson thought that the study of consciousness was flawed. Because he believed that objective analysis of the mind was impossible, Watson preferred to focus directly on observable behavior and try to bring that behavior under control. Watson was a major proponent of shifting the focus of psychology from the mind to behavior, and this approach of observing and controlling behavior came to be known as behaviorism. A major object of study by behaviorists was learned behavior and its interaction with inborn qualities of the organism. Behaviorism commonly used animals in experiments under the assumption that what was learned using animal models could, to some degree, be applied to human behavior. Indeed, Tolman (1938) stated, “I believe that everything important in psychology (except … such matters as involve society and words) can be investigated in essence through the continued experimental and theoretical analysis of the determiners of rat behavior at a choice-point in a maze.” FIGURE 1.5 John B. Watson is known as the father of behaviorism within psychology. Behaviorism dominated experimental psychology for several decades, and its influence can still be felt today (Thorne & Henley, 2005). Behaviorism is largely responsible for establishing psychology as a scientific discipline through its objective methods and especially experimentation. In addition, it is used in behavioral and cognitive-behavioral therapy. Behavior modification is commonly used in classroom settings. Behaviorism has also led to research on environmental influences on human behavior. B. F. Skinner (1904–1990) was an American psychologist (Figure 1.6). Like Watson, Skinner was a behaviorist, and he concentrated on how behavior was affected by its consequences. Therefore, Skinner spoke of reinforcement and punishment as major factors in driving behavior. As a part of his research, Skinner developed a chamber that allowed the careful study of the principles of modifying behavior through reinforcement and punishment. This device, known as an operant conditioning chamber (or more familiarly, a Skinner box), has remained a popular tool for studying the effects of punishment and reinforcement on behaviors. The Skinner box has been used to study a wide range of behaviors, including learning, memory, problem solving, decision making, fear, anxiety, aggression, addiction, self-control, learning disabilities, learning disabilities, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and many others. It has also been used in the development of behavioral therapies, such as aversion therapy and systematic desensitization. Figure 1. 6 B. F.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a form of psychotherapy that aims to help people change their thoughts and behaviors in order to improve their lives. CBT is based on the principles of humanistic psychology, which emphasize the importance of self-awareness and personal responsibility in achieving personal growth and self-fulfillment. According to the American Psychological Association (APA), the primary goal of cognitive behavior therapy is to enable clients to identify and change unhealthy thought patterns and beliefs that interfere with their ability to achieve their goals and live healthy, fulfilling lives (American Psychological Association, n.d., p. 3).

While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember\\nwhat he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is\\nassociated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend’s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John\\nNash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would\\ntell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended\\nfor him. He also began to hear voices and became suspicious of the people around him. Soon thereafter, Nash\\nwas diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a state-run mental institution (O’Connor & Robertson,\\n1Introduction to Psychology\\n2002). Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these\\nexperiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain’s internal\\nprocesses and people’s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of\\npsychology has explored these questions.\\n1.1 What Is Psychology?\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Define psychology\\n• Understand the merits of an education in psychology\\nWhat is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology\\nexplores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists\\nuse the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question\\nabout how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the\\nphenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or\\ngroup of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over\\ntime. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes\\nobservations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then\\npublished or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.\\nScientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because\\nit is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We\\nmust ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However,\\nwe can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus,\\npsychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.\\nIn general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot\\narrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the\\nmind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific\\nmethod is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on\\nobservation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or\\nprevious authorities.\\nIt was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this\\ntime, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is,\\nat its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological\\norganism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore,\\npsychology is also a social science.\\nWHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?\\nOften, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to\\nlearn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course\\nbecause it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as\\nnursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare\\npsychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses\\nacross the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology\\nmajors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook’s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality\\nand political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About\\n6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S.\\nDepartment of Education, 2016).\\n8 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nAn education in psychology is valuable for a number of reasons. Psychology students hone critical thinking\\nskills and are trained in the use of the scientific method. Critical thinking is the active application of a set of\\nskills to information for the understanding and evaluation of that information. The evaluation of\\ninformation—assessing its reliability and usefulness— is an important skill in a world full of competing “facts,”\\nmany of which are designed to be misleading. For example, critical thinking involves maintaining an attitude\\nof skepticism, recognizing internal biases, making use of logical thinking, asking appropriate questions, and\\nmaking observations. Psychology students also can develop better communication skills during the course of\\ntheir undergraduate coursework (American Psychological Association, 2011). Together, these factors increase\\nstudents’ scientific literacy and prepare students to critically evaluate the various sources of information they\\nencounter.\\nIn addition to these broad-based skills, psychology students come to understand the complex factors that\\nshape one’s behavior. They appreciate the interaction of our biology, our environment, and our experiences in\\ndetermining who we are and how we will behave. They learn about basic principles that guide how we think\\nand behave, and they come to recognize the tremendous diversity that exists across individuals and across\\ncultural boundaries (American Psychological Association, 2011).\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nWatch a brief video about some questions to consider before deciding to major in psychology\\n(http://openstax.org/l/psycmajor) to learn more.\\n1.2 History of Psychology\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Understand the importance of Wundt and James in the development of psychology\\n• Appreciate Freud’s influence on psychology\\n• Understand the basic tenets of Gestalt psychology\\n• Appreciate the important role that behaviorism played in psychology’s history\\n• Understand basic tenets of humanism\\n• Understand how the cognitive revolution shifted psychology’s focus back to the mind\\nPsychology is a relatively young science with its experimental roots in the 19th century, compared, for\\nexample, to human physiology, which dates much earlier. As mentioned, anyone interested in exploring issues\\nrelated to the mind generally did so in a philosophical context prior to the 19th century. Two 19th century\\nscholars, Wilhelm Wundt and William James, are generally credited as being the founders of psychology as a\\nscience and academic discipline that was distinct from philosophy. This section will provide an overview of the\\nshifts in paradigms that have influenced psychology from Wundt and James through today.\\nWundt and Structuralism\\nWilhelm Wundt (1832–1920) was a German scientist who was the first person to be referred to as a\\npsychologist. His famous book entitled Principles of Physiological Psychology was published in 1873. Wundt\\nviewed psychology as a scientific study of conscious experience, and he believed that the goal of psychology\\nwas to identify components of consciousness and how those components combined to result in our conscious\\nexperience. Wundt used introspection (he called it “internal perception”), a process by which someone\\nexamines their own conscious experience as objectively as possible, making the human mind like any other\\naspect of nature that a scientist observed. He believed in the notion of voluntarism—that people have free will\\nand should know the intentions of a psychological experiment if they were participating (Danziger, 1980).\\nWundt considered his version experimental introspection; he used instruments such as those that measured\\nreaction time. He also wrote Volkerpsychologie in 1904 in which he suggested that psychology should include\\nthe study of culture, as it involves the study of people. Edward Titchener, one of his students, went on to\\n1.2 • History of Psychology 9\\ndevelop structuralism. Its focus was on the contents of mental processes rather than their function (Pickren &\\nRutherford, 2010). Wundt established his psychology laboratory at the University at Leipzig in 1879 (Figure\\n1.2). In this laboratory, Wundt and his students conducted experiments on, for example, reaction times. A\\nsubject, sometimes in a room isolated from the scientist, would receive a stimulus such as a light, image, or\\nsound. The subject’s reaction to the stimulus would be to push a button, and an apparatus would record the\\ntime to reaction. Wundt could measure reaction time to one-thousandth of a second (Nicolas & Ferrand, 1999).\\nFIGURE 1.2 (a) Wilhelm Wundt is credited as one of the founders of psychology. He created the first laboratory for\\npsychological research. (b) This photo shows him seated and surrounded by fellow researchers and equipment in\\nhis laboratory in Germany.\\nHowever, despite his efforts to train individuals in the process of introspection, this process remained highly\\nsubjective, and there was very little agreement between individuals.\\nFunctionalism\\nWilliam James, John Dewey, and Charles Sanders Peirce helped establish functional psychology (Figure 1.3).\\nThey accepted Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection and viewed this theory as an explanation of an\\norganism’s characteristics. Key to that theory is the idea that natural selection leads to organisms that are\\nadapted to their environment, including their behavior. Adaptation means that a trait of an organism has a\\nfunction for the survival and reproduction of the individual, because it has been naturally selected. As James\\nsaw it, psychology’s purpose was to study the function of behavior in the world, and as such, his perspective\\nwas known as functionalism. Functionalism focused on how mental activities helped an organism fit into its\\nenvironment. Functionalism has a second, more subtle meaning in that functionalists were more interested in\\nthe operation of the whole mind rather than of its individual parts, which were the focus of structuralism. Like\\nWundt, James believed that introspection could serve as one means by which someone might study mental\\nactivities, but James also relied on more objective measures, including the use of various recording devices,\\nand examinations of concrete products of mental activities and of anatomy and physiology (Gordon, 1995).\\n10 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\n4-year institutions and use these opportunities to gain experience in teaching. Furthermore, many 2-year\\ncolleges and schools need faculty to teach their courses in psychology. In general, many of the people who\\npursue careers at these institutions have master’s degrees in psychology, although some PhDs make careers at\\nthese institutions as well.\\nSome people earning PhDs may enjoy research in an academic setting. However, they may not be interested in\\nteaching. These individuals might take on faculty positions that are exclusively devoted to conducting\\nresearch. This type of position would be more likely an option at large, research-focused universities.\\nIn some areas in psychology, it is common for individuals who have recently earned their PhD to seek out\\npositions in postdoctoral training programs that are available before going on to serve as faculty. In most\\ncases, young scientists will complete one or two postdoctoral programs before applying for a full-time faculty\\nposition. Postdoctoral training programs allow young scientists to further develop their research programs\\nand broaden their research skills under the supervision of other professionals in the field.\\nCareer Options Outside of Academic Settings\\nIndividuals who wish to become practicing clinical psychologists have another option for earning a doctoral\\ndegree, which is known as a PsyD. A PsyD is a doctor of psychology degree that is increasingly popular among\\nindividuals interested in pursuing careers in clinical psychology. PsyD programs generally place less emphasis\\non research-oriented skills and focus more on application of psychological principles in the clinical context\\n(Norcross & Castle, 2002).\\nRegardless of whether earning a PhD or PsyD, in most states, an individual wishing to practice as a licensed\\nclinical or counseling psychologist may complete postdoctoral work under the supervision of a licensed\\npsychologist. Within the last few years, however, several states have begun to remove this requirement, which\\nwould allow people to get an earlier start in their careers (Munsey, 2009). After an individual has met the state\\nrequirements, their credentials are evaluated to determine whether they can sit for the licensure exam. Only\\nindividuals that pass this exam can call themselves licensed clinical or counseling psychologists (Norcross,\\nn.d.). Licensed clinical or counseling psychologists can then work in a number of settings, ranging from private\\nclinical practice to hospital settings. It should be noted that clinical psychologists and psychiatrists do different\\nthings and receive different types of education. While both can conduct therapy and counseling, clinical\\npsychologists have a PhD or a PsyD, whereas psychiatrists have a doctor of medicine degree (MD). As such,\\nlicensed clinical psychologists can administer and interpret psychological tests, while psychiatrists can\\nprescribe medications.\\nIndividuals earning a PhD can work in a variety of settings, depending on their areas of specialization. For\\nexample, someone trained as a biopsychologist might work in a pharmaceutical company to help test the\\nefficacy of a new drug. Someone with a clinical background might become a forensic psychologist and work\\nwithin the legal system to make recommendations during criminal trials and parole hearings, or serve as an\\nexpert in a court case.\\nWhile earning a doctoral degree in psychology is a lengthy process, usually taking between 5–6 years of\\ngraduate study (DeAngelis, 2010), there are a number of careers that can be attained with a master’s degree in\\npsychology. People who wish to provide psychotherapy can become licensed to serve as various types of\\nprofessional counselors (Hoffman, 2012). Relevant master’s degrees are also sufficient for individuals seeking\\ncareers as school psychologists (National Association of School Psychologists, n.d.), in some capacities related\\nto sport psychology (American Psychological Association, 2014), or as consultants in various industrial\\nsettings (Landers, 2011, June 14). Undergraduate coursework in psychology may be applicable to other careers\\nsuch as psychiatric social work or psychiatric nursing, where assessments and therapy may be a part of the\\njob.\\nAs mentioned in the opening section of this chapter, an undergraduate education in psychology is associated\\nwith a knowledge base and skill set that many employers find quite attractive. It should come as no surprise,\\n28 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nthen, that individuals earning bachelor’s degrees in psychology find themselves in a number of different\\ncareers, as shown in Table 1.1. Examples of a few such careers can involve serving as case managers, working\\nin sales, working in human resource departments, and teaching in high schools. The rapidly growing realm of\\nhealthcare professions is another field in which an education in psychology is helpful and sometimes required.\\nFor example, the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) exam that people must take to be admitted to medical\\nschool now includes a section on the psychological foundations of behavior.\\nTop Occupations Employing Graduates with a BA in Psychology (Fogg, Harrington, Harrington, & Shatkin,\\n2012)\\nRanking Occupation\\n1 Mid- and top-level management (executive, administrator)\\n2 Sales\\n3 Social work\\n4 Other management positions\\n5 Human resources (personnel, training)\\n6 Other administrative positions\\n7 Insurance, real estate, business\\n8 Marketing and sales\\n9 Healthcare (nurse, pharmacist, therapist)\\n10 Finance (accountant, auditor)\\nTABLE 1.1\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nThe APA provides career information (http://openstax.org/l/careers) about various areas of psychology.\\n1.4 • Careers in Psychology 29\\nKey Terms\\nAmerican Psychological Association (APA) professional organization representing psychologists in the\\nUnited States\\nbehaviorism focus on observing and controlling behavior\\nbiopsychology study of how biology influences behavior\\nbiopsychosocial model perspective that asserts that biology, psychology, and social factors interact to\\ndetermine an individual’s health\\nclinical psychology area of psychology that focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of psychological disorders\\nand other problematic patterns of behavior\\ncognitive psychology study of cognitions, or thoughts, and their relationship to experiences and actions\\ncounseling psychology area of psychology that focuses on improving emotional, social, vocational, and other\\naspects of the lives of psychologically healthy individuals\\ndevelopmental psychology scientific study of development across a lifespan\\ndissertation long research paper about research that was conducted as a part of the candidate’s doctoral\\ntraining\\nempirical method method for acquiring knowledge based on observation, including experimentation, rather\\nthan a method based only on forms of logical argument or previous authorities\\nforensic psychology area of psychology that applies the science and practice of psychology to issues within\\nand related to the justice system\\nfunctionalism focused on how mental activities helped an organism adapt to its environment\\nhumanism perspective within psychology that emphasizes the potential for good that is innate to all humans\\nintrospection process by which someone examines their own conscious experience in an attempt to break it\\ninto its component parts\\nology suffix that denotes “scientific study of”\\npersonality psychology study of patterns of thoughts and behaviors that make each individual unique\\npersonality trait consistent pattern of thought and behavior\\nPhD (doctor of philosophy) doctoral degree conferred in many disciplinary perspectives housed in a\\ntraditional college of liberal arts and sciences\\npostdoctoral training program allows young scientists to further develop their research programs and\\nbroaden their research skills under the supervision of other professionals in the field\\npsychoanalytic theory focus on the role of the unconscious in affecting conscious behavior\\npsychology scientific study of the mind and behavior\\nPsyD (doctor of psychology) doctoral degree that places less emphasis on research-oriented skills and focuses\\nmore on application of psychological principles in the clinical context\\nsport and exercise psychology area of psychology that focuses on the interactions between mental and\\nemotional factors and physical performance in sports, exercise, and other activities\\nstructuralism understanding the conscious experience through introspection\\nSummary\\n1.1 What Is Psychology?\\nPsychology is defined as the scientific study of mind and behavior. Students of psychology develop critical\\nthinking skills, become familiar with the scientific method, and recognize the complexity of behavior.\\n1.2 History of Psychology\\nBefore the time of Wundt and James, questions about the mind were considered by philosophers. However,\\nboth Wundt and James helped create psychology as a distinct scientific discipline. Wundt was a structuralist,\\nwhich meant he believed that our cognitive experience was best understood by breaking that experience into\\nits component parts. He thought this was best accomplished by introspection.\\n30 1 • Key Terms\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nWilliam James was the first American psychologist, and he was a proponent of functionalism. This particular\\nperspective focused on how mental activities served as adaptive responses to an organism’s environment. Like\\nWundt, James also relied on introspection; however, his research approach also incorporated more objective\\nmeasures as well.\\nSigmund Freud believed that understanding the unconscious mind was absolutely critical to understand\\nconscious behavior. This was especially true for individuals that he saw who suffered from various hysterias\\nand neuroses. Freud relied on dream analysis, slips of the tongue, and free association as means to access the\\nunconscious. Psychoanalytic theory remained a dominant force in clinical psychology for several decades.\\nGestalt psychology was very influential in Europe. Gestalt psychology takes a holistic view of an individual and\\nhis experiences. As the Nazis came to power in Germany, Wertheimer, Koffka, and Köhler immigrated to the\\nUnited States. Although they left their laboratories and their research behind, they did introduce America to\\nGestalt ideas. Some of the principles of Gestalt psychology are still very influential in the study of sensation\\nand perception.\\nOne of the most influential schools of thought within psychology’s history was behaviorism. Behaviorism\\nfocused on making psychology an objective science by studying overt behavior and deemphasizing the\\nimportance of unobservable mental processes. John Watson is often considered the father of behaviorism, and\\nB. F. Skinner’s contributions to our understanding of principles of operant conditioning cannot be\\nunderestimated.\\nAs behaviorism and psychoanalytic theory took hold of so many aspects of psychology, some began to become\\ndissatisfied with psychology’s picture of human nature. Thus, a humanistic movement within psychology\\nbegan to take hold. Humanism focuses on the potential of all people for good. Both Maslow and Rogers were\\ninfluential in shaping humanistic psychology.\\nDuring the 1950s, the landscape of psychology began to change. A science of behavior began to shift back to its\\nroots of focus on mental processes. The emergence of neuroscience and computer science aided this\\ntransition. Ultimately, the cognitive revolution took hold, and people came to realize that cognition was crucial\\nto a true appreciation and understanding of behavior.\\n1.3 Contemporary Psychology\\nPsychology is a diverse discipline that is made up of several major subdivisions with unique perspectives.\\nBiological psychology involves the study of the biological bases of behavior. Sensation and perception refer to\\nthe area of psychology that is focused on how information from our sensory modalities is received, and how\\nthis information is transformed into our perceptual experiences of the world around us. Cognitive psychology\\nis concerned with the relationship that exists between thought and behavior, and developmental psychologists\\nstudy the physical and cognitive changes that occur throughout one’s lifespan. Personality psychology focuses\\non individuals’ unique patterns of behavior, thought, and emotion. Industrial and organizational psychology,\\nhealth psychology, sport and exercise psychology, forensic psychology, and clinical psychology are all\\nconsidered applied areas of psychology. Industrial and organizational psychologists apply psychological\\nconcepts to I-O settings. Health psychologists look for ways to help people live healthier lives, and clinical\\npsychology involves the diagnosis and treatment of psychological disorders and other problematic behavioral\\npatterns. Sport and exercise psychologists study the interactions between thoughts, emotions, and physical\\nperformance in sports, exercise, and other activities. Forensic psychologists carry out activities related to\\npsychology in association with the justice system.\\n1.4 Careers in Psychology\\nGenerally, academic careers in psychology require doctoral degrees. However, there are a number of\\nnonacademic career options for people who have master’s degrees in psychology. While people with bachelor’s\\ndegrees in psychology have more limited psychology-related career options, the skills acquired as a function of\\n1 • Summary 31\\nan undergraduate education in psychology are useful in a variety of work contexts.\\nReview Questions\\n1.

Zimmerman observed the boy dressed in a hoodie and pursued Martin. Zimmerman called the\\npolice to report a person acting suspiciously, which he had done on other occasions. According to the 911 call\\ntranscript, Zimmerman said on the call, \"[expletive] punks. These [expletive], they always get away.\" The 911\\noperator told Zimmerman not to follow the teen, as was also stated in the police neighborhood watch\\nguidelines that had been provided to Zimmerman. A physical altercation ended with Zimmerman fatally\\nshooting Martin. Zimmerman claimed that he acted in self-defense. Martin was unarmed, and after his death,\\nthere was a nationwide outcry.

Essentially, people will change their behavior to\\nalign with the social situation at hand. If we are in a new situation or are unsure how to behave, we will take our\\ncues from other individuals.\\nThe field of social psychology studies topics at both the intra- and interpersonal levels. Intrapersonal topics\\n(those that pertain to the individual) include emotions and attitudes, the self, and social cognition (the ways in\\nwhich we think about ourselves and others). Interpersonal topics (those that pertain to dyads and groups)\\ninclude helping behavior (Figure 12.2), aggression, prejudice and discrimination, attraction and close\\nrelationships, and group processes and intergroup relationships.\\nFIGURE 12.2 Social psychology deals with all kinds of interactions between people, spanning a wide range of how\\nwe connect: from moments of confrontation to moments of working together and helping others, as shown here.\\n(credit: Sgt. Derec Pierson, U.S. Army)\\nSocial psychologists focus on how people conceptualize and interpret situations and how these interpretations\\ninfluence their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors (Ross & Nisbett, 1991). Thus, social psychology studies\\nindividuals in a social context and how situational variables interact to influence behavior. In this chapter, we\\ndiscuss the intrapersonal processes of self-presentation, cognitive dissonance and attitude change, and the\\n400 12 • Social Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\ninterpersonal processes of conformity and obedience, aggression and altruism, and, finally, love and\\nattraction.\\nSituational and Dispositional Influences on Behavior\\nBehavior is a product of both the situation (e.g., cultural influences, social roles, and the presence of\\nbystanders) and of the person (e.g., personality characteristics). Subfields of psychology tend to focus on one\\ninfluence or behavior over others. Situationism is the view that our behavior and actions are determined by\\nour immediate environment and surroundings. In contrast, dispositionism holds that our behavior is\\ndetermined by internal factors (Heider, 1958). An internal factor is an attribute of a person and includes\\npersonality traits and temperament. Social psychologists have tended to take the situationist perspective,\\nwhereas personality psychologists have promoted the dispositionist perspective. Modern approaches to social\\npsychology, however, take both the situation and the individual into account when studying human behavior\\n(Fiske, Gilbert, & Lindzey, 2010). In fact, the field of social-personality psychology has emerged to study the\\ncomplex interaction of internal and situational factors that affect human behavior (Mischel, 1977; Richard,\\nBond, & Stokes-Zoota, 2003).\\nFundamental Attribution Error\\nIn the United States, the predominant culture tends to favor a dispositional approach in explaining human\\nbehavior. Why do you think this is? We tend to think that people are in control of their own behaviors, and,\\ntherefore, any behavior change must be due to something internal, such as their personality, habits, or\\ntemperament. According to some social psychologists, people tend to overemphasize internal factors as\\nexplanations—or attributions—for the behavior of other people. They tend to assume that the behavior of\\nanother person is a trait of that person, and to underestimate the power of the situation on the behavior of\\nothers. They tend to fail to recognize when the behavior of another is due to situational variables, and thus to\\nthe person’s state. This erroneous assumption is called the fundamental attribution error (Ross, 1977; Riggio\\n& Garcia, 2009). To better understand, imagine this scenario: Jamie returns home from work, and opens the\\nfront door to a happy greeting from spouse Morgan who inquires how the day has been. Instead of returning\\nthe spouse’s kind greeting, Jamie yells, “Leave me alone!” Why did Jamie yell? How would someone\\ncommitting the fundamental attribution error explain Jamie’s behavior? The most common response is that\\nJamie is a mean, angry, or unfriendly person (traits). This is an internal or dispositional explanation. However,\\nimagine that Jamie was just laid off from work due to company downsizing. Would your explanation for Jamie’s\\nbehavior change? Your revised explanation might be that Jamie was frustrated and disappointed about being\\nlaid off and was therefore in a bad mood (state). This is now an external or situational explanation for Jamie’s\\nbehavior.\\nThe fundamental attribution error is so powerful that people often overlook obvious situational influences on\\nbehavior. A classic example was demonstrated in a series of experiments known as the quizmaster study (Ross,\\nAmabile, & Steinmetz, 1977). Student participants were randomly assigned to play the role of a questioner (the\\nquizmaster) or a contestant in a quiz game. Questioners developed difficult questions to which they knew the\\nanswers, and they presented these questions to the contestants. The contestants answered the questions\\ncorrectly only 4 out of 10 times (Figure 12.3). After the task, the questioners and contestants were asked to rate\\ntheir own general knowledge compared to the average student. Questioners did not rate their general\\nknowledge higher than the contestants, but the contestants rated the questioners’ intelligence higher than\\ntheir own. In a second study, observers of the interaction also rated the questioner as having more general\\nknowledge than the contestant. The obvious influence on performance is the situation. The questioners wrote\\nthe questions, so of course they had an advantage. Both the contestants and observers made an internal\\nattribution for the performance. They concluded that the questioners must be more intelligent than the\\ncontestants.\\n12.1 • What Is Social Psychology? 401\\nFIGURE 12.3 In the quizmaster study, people tended to disregard the influence of the situation and wrongly\\nconcluded that a questioner’s knowledge was greater than their own. (credit: Steve Jurvetson)\\nThe halo effect refers to the tendency to let the overall impression of an individual color the way in which we\\nfeel about their character. For instance, we might assume that people who are physically attractive are more\\nlikely to be good people than less attractive individuals. Another example of how the halo effect might manifest\\nwould involve assuming that someone whom we perceive to be outgoing or friendly has a better moral\\ncharacter than someone who is not.\\nAs demonstrated in the examples above, the fundamental attribution error is considered a powerful influence\\nin how we explain the behaviors of others. However, it should be noted that some researchers have suggested\\nthat the fundamental attribution error may not be as powerful as it is often portrayed. In fact, a recent review\\nof more than 173 published studies suggests that several factors (e.g., high levels of idiosyncrasy of the\\ncharacter and how well hypothetical events are explained) play a role in determining just how influential the\\nfundamental attribution error is (Malle, 2006).\\nIs the Fundamental Attribution Error a Universal Phenomenon?\\nYou may be able to think of examples of the fundamental attribution error in your life. Do people in all cultures\\ncommit the fundamental attribution error? Research suggests that they do not. People from an individualistic\\nculture, that is, a culture that focuses on individual achievement and autonomy, have the greatest tendency to\\ncommit the fundamental attribution error. Individualistic cultures, which tend to be found in western\\ncountries such as the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, promote a focus on the individual.\\nTherefore, a person’s disposition is thought to be the primary explanation for her behavior. In contrast, people\\nfrom a collectivistic culture, that is, a culture that focuses on communal relationships with others, such as\\nfamily, friends, and community (Figure 12.4), are less likely to commit the fundamental attribution error\\n(Markus & Kitayama, 1991; Triandis, 2001).\\nFIGURE 12.4 People from collectivistic cultures, such as some Asian cultures, are more likely to emphasize\\nrelationships with others than to focus primarily on the individual.

While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember what he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is associated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend’s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John Nash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would tell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended for him. He also began to hear voices in his head that he could not control. When he tried to stop them, they would come back to him, and when he did not want them to, the voices would leave him (Wearing, n.d.). These are just a few of the many examples of how people experience the world around them in ways that are unpredictable and difficult to understand. In this chapter, we will explore what psychology is, what it is not, and how it has evolved over time. We will also look at some common misconceptions about psychology. Finally, we will discuss some careers in psychology and the role that psychology plays in our lives. 2. WHAT IS PSYCHOLOGY? The word “psychology” comes from two Greek words, “psyche” and “logos,” which mean “mind” or “thinking.” Psychologists are interested in how the mind works and how we think and feel. They study the mental processes that occur in the brain, such as perception, attention, memory, thinking, problem solving, emotion, motivation, learning, decision making, self-regulation, personality, social behavior, etc. Psychologists use a variety of methods to study these processes, including observation, experiments, surveys, interviews, questionnaires, brain imaging, neuropsychology, cognitive neuroscience, psychometrics, clinical psychology, developmental psychology, ethnopsychology and social psychology. Psychology has a long and rich history. It has been practiced for thousands of years in many different cultures and societies. For example, in ancient Greece, Plato and Aristotle studied psychology in order to understand the nature of human beings and their relationships with each other and with their environment. In the Middle Ages, Christian theologians and philosophers used psychology as a tool for understanding the nature of God and his relationship with his creatures. During the Renaissance, scientists and thinkers such as Galileo Galilei, Isaac Newton, René Descartes, John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Auguste Comte, Jean-Paul Sartre, Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, William James, Edward Thorndike, B.F. Skinner and others developed theories of psychology that continue to shape our understanding of this field today. Today, psychology is a broad and diverse field that encompasses a wide range of subfields and disciplines. Some of these disciplines include: • Clinical psychology: This field focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders, as well as', 'references': '{\"sections\": [\"Psychological Research/Approaches to Research\", \"Introduction to Psychology/Contemporary Psychology\", \"Social Psychology/Attitudes and Persuasion\"], \"pages\": [\"42\", \"20\", \"412\"]}'}\n",

In this chapter we explore the fascinating tale of how you\\nhave grown and developed into the person you are today. We also look at some ideas about who you will grow\\ninto tomorrow. Yours is a story of lifespan development (Figure 9.1), from the start of life to the end.\\nThe process of human growth and development is more obvious in infancy and childhood, yet your\\ndevelopment is happening this moment and will continue, minute by minute, for the rest of your life. Who you\\nare today and who you will be in the future depends on a blend of genetics, environment, culture,\\nrelationships, and more, as you continue through each phase of life. You have experienced firsthand much of\\nwhat is discussed in this chapter. Now consider what psychological science has to say about your physical,\\ncognitive, and psychosocial development, from the womb to the tomb.\\n9Lifespan Development\\n9.1 What Is Lifespan Development?\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Define and distinguish between the three domains of development: physical, cognitive and psychosocial\\n• Discuss the normative approach to development\\n• Understand the three major issues in development: continuity and discontinuity, one common course of\\ndevelopment or many unique courses of development, and nature versus nurture\\nMy heart leaps up when I behold\\nA rainbow in the sky:\\nSo was it when my life began;\\nSo is it now I am a man;\\nSo be it when I shall grow old,\\nOr let me die!\\nThe Child is father of the Man;\\nI could wish my days to be\\nBound each to each by natural piety. (Wordsworth, 1802)\\nIn this poem, William Wordsworth writes, “the child is father of the man.” What does this seemingly\\nincongruous statement mean, and what does it have to do with lifespan development? Wordsworth might be\\nsuggesting that the person he is as an adult depends largely on the experiences he had in childhood. Consider\\nthe following questions: To what extent is the adult you are today influenced by the child you once were? To\\nwhat extent is a child fundamentally different from the adult he grows up to be?\\nThese are the types of questions developmental psychologists try to answer, by studying how humans change\\nand grow from conception through childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and death. They view development as a\\nlifelong process that can be studied scientifically across three developmental domains—physical, cognitive,\\nand psychosocial development. Physical development involves growth and changes in the body and brain, the\\nsenses, motor skills, and health and wellness. Cognitive development involves learning, attention, memory,\\nlanguage, thinking, reasoning, and creativity. Psychosocial development involves emotions, personality, and\\nsocial relationships. We refer to these domains throughout the chapter.\\nResearch Methods in Developmental Psychology\\nYou’ve learned about a variety of research methods used by psychologists. Developmental psychologists use many\\nof these approaches in order to better understand how individuals change mentally and physically over time. These\\nmethods include naturalistic observations, case studies, surveys, and experiments, among others.\\nNaturalistic observations involve observing behavior in its natural context. A developmental psychologist might\\nobserve how children behave on a playground, at a daycare center, or in the child’s own home. While this research\\napproach provides a glimpse into how children behave in their natural settings, researchers have very little control\\nover the types and/or frequencies of displayed behavior.\\nIn a case study, developmental psychologists collect a great deal of information from one individual in order to\\nbetter understand physical and psychological changes over the lifespan. This particular approach is an excellent way\\nto better understand individuals, who are exceptional in some way, but it is especially prone to researcher bias in\\ninterpretation, and it is difficult to generalize conclusions to the larger population.\\nIn one classic example of this research method being applied to a study of lifespan development Sigmund Freud\\nanalyzed the development of a child known as “Little Hans” (Freud, 1909/1949). Freud’s findings helped inform his\\ntheories of psychosexual development in children, which you will learn about later in this chapter. Little Genie, the\\nCONNECT THE CONCEPTS\\n280 9 • Lifespan Development\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nsubject of a case study discussed in the chapter on thinking and intelligence, provides another example of how\\npsychologists examine developmental milestones through detailed research on a single individual. In Genie’s case,\\nher neglectful and abusive upbringing led to her being unable to speak until, at age 13, she was removed from that\\nharmful environment. As she learned to use language, psychologists were able to compare how her language\\nacquisition abilities differed when occurring in her late-stage development compared to the typical acquisition of\\nthose skills during the ages of infancy through early childhood (Fromkin, Krashen, Curtiss, Rigler, & Rigler, 1974;\\nCurtiss, 1981).\\nThe survey method asks individuals to self-report important information about their thoughts, experiences, and\\nbeliefs. This particular method can provide large amounts of information in relatively short amounts of time;\\nhowever, validity of data collected in this way relies on honest self-reporting, and the data is relatively shallow when\\ncompared to the depth of information collected in a case study. An example of comprehensive survey was the\\nresearch done by Ruth W. Howard. In 1934, she obtained her doctorate by surveying 229 sets of triplets, the most\\ncomprehensive research of triplets completed at the time. This pioneering woman was also the first African-\\nAmerican woman to earn a PhD in psychology (American Psychological Association, 2019).\\nExperiments involve significant control over extraneous variables and manipulation of the independent variable. As\\nsuch, experimental research allows developmental psychologists to make causal statements about certain variables\\nthat are important for the developmental process. Because experimental research must occur in a controlled\\nenvironment, researchers must be cautious about whether behaviors observed in the laboratory translate to an\\nindividual’s natural environment.\\nLater in this chapter, you will learn about several experiments in which toddlers and young children observe scenes\\nor actions so that researchers can determine at what age specific cognitive abilities develop. For example, children\\nmay observe a quantity of liquid poured from a short, fat glass into a tall, skinny glass. As the experimenters\\nquestion the children about what occurred, the subjects’ answers help psychologists understand at what age a child\\nbegins to comprehend that the volume of liquid remained the same although the shapes of the containers differs.\\nAcross these three domains—physical, cognitive, and psychosocial—the normative approach to development\\nis also discussed. This approach asks, “What is normal development?” In the early decades of the 20th century,\\nnormative psychologists studied large numbers of children at various ages to determine norms (i.e., average\\nages) of when most children reach specific developmental milestones in each of the three domains (Gesell,\\n1933, 1939, 1940; Gesell & Ilg, 1946; Hall, 1904). Although children develop at slightly different rates, we can\\nuse these age-related averages as general guidelines to compare children with same-age peers to determine\\nthe approximate ages they should reach specific normative events called developmental milestones (e.g.,\\ncrawling, walking, writing, dressing, naming colors, speaking in sentences, and starting puberty).\\nNot all normative events are universal, meaning they are not experienced by all individuals across all cultures.\\nBiological milestones, such as puberty, tend to be universal, but social milestones, such as the age when\\nchildren begin formal schooling, are not necessarily universal; instead, they affect most individuals in a\\nparticular culture (Gesell & Ilg, 1946). For example, in developed countries children begin school around 5 or 6\\nyears old, but in developing countries, like Nigeria, children often enter school at an advanced age, if at all\\n(Huebler, 2005; United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization [UNESCO], 2013).\\nTo better understand the normative approach, imagine two new mothers, Louisa and Kimberly, who are close\\nfriends and have children around the same age. Louisa’s daughter is 14 months old, and Kimberly’s son is 12\\nmonths old. According to the normative approach, the average age a child starts to walk is 12 months.\\nHowever, at 14 months Louisa’s daughter still isn’t walking. She tells Kimberly she is worried that something\\nmight be wrong with her baby. Kimberly is surprised because her son started walking when he was only 10\\nmonths old. Should Louisa be worried? Should she be concerned if her daughter is not walking by 15 months\\nor 18 months?\\n9.1 • What Is Lifespan Development? 281\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) describes the developmental milestones for children\\nfrom 2 months through 5 years old. After reviewing the information, take this Developmental Milestones Quiz\\n(http://openstax.org/l/milestones) to see how well you recall what you’ve learned. If you are a parent with\\nconcerns about your child’s development, contact your pediatrician.\\nIssues in Developmental Psychology\\nThere are many different theoretical approaches regarding human development. As we evaluate them in this\\nchapter, recall that developmental psychology focuses on how people change, and keep in mind that all the\\napproaches that we present in this chapter address questions of change: Is the change smooth or uneven\\n(continuous versus discontinuous)? Is this pattern of change the same for everyone, or are there many\\ndifferent patterns of change (one course of development versus many courses)? How do genetics and\\nenvironment interact to influence development (nature versus nurture)?\\nIs Development Continuous or Discontinuous?\\nContinuous development views development as a cumulative process, gradually improving on existing skills\\n(Figure 9.2). With this type of development, there is gradual change. Consider, for example, a child’s physical\\ngrowth: adding inches to height year by year. In contrast, theorists who view development as discontinuous\\nbelieve that development takes place in unique stages: It occurs at specific times or ages. With this type of\\ndevelopment, the change is more sudden, such as an infant’s ability to conceive object permanence.\\nFIGURE 9.2 The concept of continuous development can be visualized as a smooth slope of progression, whereas\\ndiscontinuous development sees growth in more discrete stages.\\nIs There One Course of Development or Many?\\nIs development essentially the same, or universal, for all children (i.e., there is one course of development) or\\ndoes development follow a different course for each child, depending on the child’s specific genetics and\\nenvironment (i.e., there are many courses of development)? Do people across the world share more similarities\\nor more differences in their development? How much do culture and genetics influence a child’s behavior?\\nStage theories hold that the sequence of development is universal. For example, in cross-cultural studies of\\nlanguage development, children from around the world reach language milestones in a similar sequence\\n(Gleitman & Newport, 1995). Infants in all cultures coo before they babble. They begin babbling at about the\\nsame age and utter their first word around 12 months old. Yet we live in diverse contexts that have a unique\\neffect on each of us. For example, researchers once believed that motor development follows one course for all\\nchildren regardless of culture. However, child care practices vary by culture, and different practices have been\\nfound to accelerate or inhibit achievement of developmental milestones such as sitting, crawling, and walking\\n(Karasik, Adolph, Tamis-LeMonda, & Bornstein, 2010).\\nFor instance, let’s look at the Aché society in Paraguay. They spend a significant amount of time foraging in\\n282 9 • Lifespan Development\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nforests. While foraging, Aché mothers carry their young children, rarely putting them down in order to protect\\nthem from getting hurt in the forest. Consequently, their children walk much later: They walk around 23–25\\nmonths old, in comparison to infants in Western cultures who begin to walk around 12 months old. However,\\nas Aché children become older, they are allowed more freedom to move about, and by about age 9, their motor\\nskills surpass those of U.S. children of the same age: Aché children are able to climb trees up to 25 feet tall and\\nuse machetes to chop their way through the forest (Kaplan & Dove, 1987). As you can see, our development is\\ninfluenced by multiple contexts, so the timing of basic motor functions may vary across cultures. However, the\\nfunctions themselves are present in all societies (Figure 9.3).\\nFIGURE 9.3 All children across the world love to play. Whether in (a) Florida or (b) South Africa, children enjoy\\nexploring sand, sunshine, and the sea.

This longstanding question is known in psychology as the nature versus nurture\\ndebate. It seeks to understand how our personalities and traits are the product of our genetic makeup and\\nbiological factors, and how they are shaped by our environment, including our guardians, peers, and culture.\\nFor instance, why do biological children sometimes act like their parents—is it because of genetics or because\\nof early childhood environment and what the child has learned from the parents? What about children who are\\nadopted—are they more like their biological families or more like their adoptive families? And how can siblings\\nfrom the same family be so different?\\nWe are all born with specific genetic traits inherited from our parents, such as eye color, height, and certain\\npersonality traits. Beyond our basic genotype, however, there is a deep interaction between our genes and our\\nenvironment: Our unique experiences in our environment influence whether and how particular traits are\\nexpressed, and at the same time, our genes influence how we interact with our environment (Diamond, 2009;\\nLobo, 2008). This chapter will show that there is a reciprocal interaction between nature and nurture as they\\nboth shape who we become, but the debate continues as to the relative contributions of each.\\nThe Achievement Gap: How Does Socioeconomic Status Affect Development?\\nThe achievement gap refers to the persistent difference in grades, test scores, and graduation rates that exist\\namong students of different ethnicities, races, and—in certain subjects—genders (Winerman, 2011). Research\\nsuggests that these achievement gaps are strongly influenced by differences in socioeconomic factors that exist\\namong the families of these children. While the researchers acknowledge that programs aimed at reducing such\\nsocioeconomic discrepancies would likely aid in equalizing the aptitude and performance of children from\\ndifferent backgrounds, they recognize that such large-scale interventions would be difficult to achieve. Therefore,\\nit is recommended that programs aimed at fostering aptitude and achievement among disadvantaged children\\nmay be the best option for dealing with issues related to academic achievement gaps (Duncan & Magnuson,\\nDIG DEEPER\\n9.1 • What Is Lifespan Development? 283\\n2005).\\nChildren from low-income households perform significantly more poorly than their middle- and high-income\\npeers on a number of educational variables: They have significantly lower standardized test scores, graduation\\nrates, and college entrance rates, and they have much higher school dropout rates. There have been attempts to\\ncorrect the achievement gap through state and federal legislation, but what if the problems start before the\\nchildren even enter school?\\nPsychologists Betty Hart and Todd Risley (2006) spent their careers looking at early language ability and\\nprogression of children in various income levels. In one longitudinal study, they found that although all the\\nparents in the study engaged and interacted with their children, middle- and high-income parents interacted with\\ntheir children differently than low-income parents. After analyzing 1,300 hours of parent-child interactions, the\\nresearchers found that middle- and high-income parents talk to their children significantly more, starting when\\nthe children are infants. By 3 years old, high-income children knew almost double the number of words known by\\ntheir low-income counterparts, and they had heard an estimated total of 30 million more words than the low-\\nincome counterparts (Hart & Risley, 2003). And the gaps only become more pronounced. Before entering\\nkindergarten, high-income children score 60% higher on achievement tests than their low-income peers (Lee &\\nBurkam, 2002).\\nThere are solutions to this problem. At the University of Chicago, experts are working with low-income families,\\nvisiting them at their homes, and encouraging them to speak more to their children on a daily and hourly basis.\\nOther experts are designing preschools in which students from diverse economic backgrounds are placed in the\\nsame classroom. In this research, low-income children made significant gains in their language development,\\nlikely as a result of attending the specialized preschool (Schechter & Byeb, 2007).

We\\nexplore several of these theories in this section.\\nPsychosexual Theory of Development\\nSigmund Freud (1856–1939) believed that personality develops during early childhood. For Freud, childhood\\nexperiences shape our personalities and behavior as adults. Freud viewed development as discontinuous; he\\nbelieved that each of us must pass through a series of stages during childhood, and that if we lack proper\\nnurturance and parenting during a stage, we may become stuck, or fixated, in that stage. Freud’s stages are\\ncalled the stages of psychosexual development. According to Freud, children’s pleasure-seeking urges are\\nfocused on a different area of the body, called an erogenous zone, at each of the five stages of development:\\noral, anal, phallic, latency, and genital.\\nWhile most of Freud’s ideas have not found support in modern research, we cannot discount the contributions\\nthat Freud has made to the field of psychology. Psychologists today dispute Freud\\'s psychosexual stages as a\\nlegitimate explanation for how one\\'s personality develops, but what we can take away from Freud’s theory is\\n284 9 • Lifespan Development\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\n', 'answer': 'Answer VERY concisely from the provided context only.

In this chapter we explore the fascinating tale of how you have grown and developed into the person you are today. We also look at some ideas about who you will grow into tomorrow. Yours is a story of lifespan development (Figure 9.1), from the start of life to the end. The process of human growth and development is more obvious in infancy and childhood, yet your development is happening this moment and will continue, minute by minute, for the rest of your life. Who you are today and who you will be in the future depends on a blend of genetics, environment, culture, relationships, and more, as you continue through each phase of life. You have experienced firsthand much of what is discussed in this chapter. Now consider what psychological science has to say about your physical, cognitive, and psychosocial development, from the womb to the tomb. 9Lifespan Development 9.1 What Is Lifespan Development? LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Define and distinguish between the three domains of development: physical, cognitive and psychosocial • Discuss the normative approach to development • Understand the three major issues in development: continuity and discontinuity, one common course of development or many unique courses of development, and nature versus nurture My heart leaps up when I behold A rainbow in the sky: So was it when my life began; So is it now I am a man; So be it when I shall grow old, Or let me die! The Child is father of the Man; I could not live without him; He is the child of my heart, And I love him with all my being. —William Blake, The Marriage of Heaven and Hell (1794) LIFE SPAN DEVELOPMENT The term “development” is used to describe the changes that occur in an organism as it grows and develops from birth to death. Development is an ongoing process that occurs throughout the life of an organism. It includes changes in structure, function, physiology, behavior, cognition, emotions, personality, and more. The term lifespan refers to a person’s life span, or the total number of years he or she will live. Lifespans vary widely from person to person, but the average lifespan of a human being is about 75 years. Most people live longer than this, with some living into their eighties and nineties. However, most people live only a few years beyond the age of 65. For example, a 55-year-old person is likely to live for about 30 more years, while someone who is 40 years old is expected to have a life expectancy of only about 28 years. This means that most people will die before they reach the peak of their physical and mental capacities. Thus, it is important to understand how the human body and mind develop and change throughout your life. There are many different theories about how humans develop. These theories can be divided into two main categories: biological and psychological. Biological theories focus on the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to human development. Psychological theories, in contrast, emphasize the role of the individual in shaping his or her own development and the influence of culture and society on human development. Biological and Psychological Approaches to Developmental Theory There is no single theory of developmental theory that is universally accepted. Instead, there are a variety of theories that have been developed over time, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some theories are based on observations of natural phenomena, such as the growth of plants and animals. Others focus on individual differences in behavior and personality. Still others are concerned with the interplay between genetics and environment. Each of these theories attempts to explain how development occurs and how it differs from one individual to another. In the following sections, we will discuss three different theoretical approaches to developmental theory: the biological approach, the social-cognitive approach (also called the psychological approach), and the developmental', 'references': '{\"sections\": [\"Lifespan Development/Stages of Development\"], \"pages\": [\"292\", \"293\", \"294\"]}'}\n",

While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember\\nwhat he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is\\nassociated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend’s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John\\nNash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would\\ntell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended\\nfor him. He also began to hear voices and became suspicious of the people around him. Soon thereafter, Nash\\nwas diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a state-run mental institution (O’Connor & Robertson,\\n1Introduction to Psychology\\n2002). Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these\\nexperiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain’s internal\\nprocesses and people’s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of\\npsychology has explored these questions.\\n1.1 What Is Psychology?\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Define psychology\\n• Understand the merits of an education in psychology\\nWhat is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology\\nexplores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists\\nuse the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question\\nabout how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the\\nphenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or\\ngroup of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over\\ntime. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes\\nobservations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then\\npublished or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.\\nScientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because\\nit is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We\\nmust ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However,\\nwe can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus,\\npsychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.\\nIn general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot\\narrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the\\nmind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific\\nmethod is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on\\nobservation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or\\nprevious authorities.\\nIt was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this\\ntime, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is,\\nat its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological\\norganism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore,\\npsychology is also a social science.\\nWHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?\\nOften, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to\\nlearn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course\\nbecause it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as\\nnursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare\\npsychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses\\nacross the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology\\nmajors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook’s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality\\nand political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About\\n6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S.\\nDepartment of Education, 2016).\\n8 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nAn education in psychology is valuable for a number of reasons. Psychology students hone critical thinking\\nskills and are trained in the use of the scientific method. Critical thinking is the active application of a set of\\nskills to information for the understanding and evaluation of that information. The evaluation of\\ninformation—assessing its reliability and usefulness— is an important skill in a world full of competing “facts,”\\nmany of which are designed to be misleading. For example, critical thinking involves maintaining an attitude\\nof skepticism, recognizing internal biases, making use of logical thinking, asking appropriate questions, and\\nmaking observations. Psychology students also can develop better communication skills during the course of\\ntheir undergraduate coursework (American Psychological Association, 2011). Together, these factors increase\\nstudents’ scientific literacy and prepare students to critically evaluate the various sources of information they\\nencounter.\\nIn addition to these broad-based skills, psychology students come to understand the complex factors that\\nshape one’s behavior. They appreciate the interaction of our biology, our environment, and our experiences in\\ndetermining who we are and how we will behave. They learn about basic principles that guide how we think\\nand behave, and they come to recognize the tremendous diversity that exists across individuals and across\\ncultural boundaries (American Psychological Association, 2011).\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nWatch a brief video about some questions to consider before deciding to major in psychology\\n(http://openstax.org/l/psycmajor) to learn more.\\n1.2 History of Psychology\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Understand the importance of Wundt and James in the development of psychology\\n• Appreciate Freud’s influence on psychology\\n• Understand the basic tenets of Gestalt psychology\\n• Appreciate the important role that behaviorism played in psychology’s history\\n• Understand basic tenets of humanism\\n• Understand how the cognitive revolution shifted psychology’s focus back to the mind\\nPsychology is a relatively young science with its experimental roots in the 19th century, compared, for\\nexample, to human physiology, which dates much earlier. As mentioned, anyone interested in exploring issues\\nrelated to the mind generally did so in a philosophical context prior to the 19th century. Two 19th century\\nscholars, Wilhelm Wundt and William James, are generally credited as being the founders of psychology as a\\nscience and academic discipline that was distinct from philosophy. This section will provide an overview of the\\nshifts in paradigms that have influenced psychology from Wundt and James through today.\\nWundt and Structuralism\\nWilhelm Wundt (1832–1920) was a German scientist who was the first person to be referred to as a\\npsychologist. His famous book entitled Principles of Physiological Psychology was published in 1873. Wundt\\nviewed psychology as a scientific study of conscious experience, and he believed that the goal of psychology\\nwas to identify components of consciousness and how those components combined to result in our conscious\\nexperience. Wundt used introspection (he called it “internal perception”), a process by which someone\\nexamines their own conscious experience as objectively as possible, making the human mind like any other\\naspect of nature that a scientist observed. He believed in the notion of voluntarism—that people have free will\\nand should know the intentions of a psychological experiment if they were participating (Danziger, 1980).\\nWundt considered his version experimental introspection; he used instruments such as those that measured\\nreaction time. He also wrote Volkerpsychologie in 1904 in which he suggested that psychology should include\\nthe study of culture, as it involves the study of people. Edward Titchener, one of his students, went on to\\n1.2 • History of Psychology 9\\ndevelop structuralism. Its focus was on the contents of mental processes rather than their function (Pickren &\\nRutherford, 2010). Wundt established his psychology laboratory at the University at Leipzig in 1879 (Figure\\n1.2). In this laboratory, Wundt and his students conducted experiments on, for example, reaction times. A\\nsubject, sometimes in a room isolated from the scientist, would receive a stimulus such as a light, image, or\\nsound. The subject’s reaction to the stimulus would be to push a button, and an apparatus would record the\\ntime to reaction. Wundt could measure reaction time to one-thousandth of a second (Nicolas & Ferrand, 1999).\\nFIGURE 1.2 (a) Wilhelm Wundt is credited as one of the founders of psychology. He created the first laboratory for\\npsychological research. (b) This photo shows him seated and surrounded by fellow researchers and equipment in\\nhis laboratory in Germany.\\nHowever, despite his efforts to train individuals in the process of introspection, this process remained highly\\nsubjective, and there was very little agreement between individuals.\\nFunctionalism\\nWilliam James, John Dewey, and Charles Sanders Peirce helped establish functional psychology (Figure 1.3).\\nThey accepted Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection and viewed this theory as an explanation of an\\norganism’s characteristics. Key to that theory is the idea that natural selection leads to organisms that are\\nadapted to their environment, including their behavior. Adaptation means that a trait of an organism has a\\nfunction for the survival and reproduction of the individual, because it has been naturally selected. As James\\nsaw it, psychology’s purpose was to study the function of behavior in the world, and as such, his perspective\\nwas known as functionalism. Functionalism focused on how mental activities helped an organism fit into its\\nenvironment. Functionalism has a second, more subtle meaning in that functionalists were more interested in\\nthe operation of the whole mind rather than of its individual parts, which were the focus of structuralism. Like\\nWundt, James believed that introspection could serve as one means by which someone might study mental\\nactivities, but James also relied on more objective measures, including the use of various recording devices,\\nand examinations of concrete products of mental activities and of anatomy and physiology (Gordon, 1995).\\n10 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\ndeveloped and worked. Until the 1960s, the science of psychology was largely a “womanless” psychology\\n(Crawford & Marecek, 1989), meaning that few women were able to practice psychology, so they had little\\ninfluence on what was studied. In addition, the experimental subjects of psychology were mostly men, which\\nresulted from underlying assumptions that gender had no influence on psychology and that women were not of\\nsufficient interest to study.\\nAn article by Naomi Weisstein, first published in 1968 (Weisstein, 1993), stimulated a feminist revolution in\\npsychology by presenting a critique of psychology as a science. She also specifically criticized male psychologists\\nfor constructing the psychology of women entirely out of their own cultural biases and without careful\\nexperimental tests to verify any of their characterizations of women. Weisstein used, as examples, statements by\\nprominent psychologists in the 1960s, such as this quote by Bruno Bettleheim: “We must start with the\\nrealization that, as much as women want to be good scientists or engineers, they want first and foremost to be\\nwomanly companions of men and to be mothers.” Weisstein’s critique formed the foundation for the subsequent\\ndevelopment of a feminist psychology that attempted to be free of the influence of male cultural biases on our\\nknowledge of the psychology of women.\\nCrawford & Marecek (1989) identify several feminist approaches to psychology that can be described as feminist\\npsychology. These include re-evaluating and discovering the contributions of women to the history of psychology,\\nstudying psychological gender differences, and questioning the male bias present across the practice of the\\nscientific approach to knowledge.\\nMulticultural And Cross-Cultural Psychology\\nCulture impacts individuals, groups, and society. An ongoing issue researchers are trying to correct is that\\ncertain populations have been over-studied and the results of these studies have been applied to other\\npopulations. For example, Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan discuss how WEIRD societies have been\\noverstudied and the results have been wrongly applied to non-WEIRD societies (2010). WEIRD stands for\\nwestern, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic. Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan found that there are\\nmany differences between people in the WEIRD group and people in less industrialized, less urban, and non-\\nWestern societies. These differences occur in a variety of areas, including perception, cooperation, and moral\\nreasoning. That is, people vary depending on their culture and environment. Multicultural psychologists\\ndevelop theories and conduct research with diverse populations, typically within one country. Cross-cultural\\npsychologists compare populations across countries, such as participants from the United States compared to\\nparticipants from China.\\nIn 1920, Francis Cecil Sumner was the first African American to receive a PhD in psychology in the United\\nStates. Sumner established a psychology degree program at Howard University, leading to the education of a\\nnew generation of African American psychologists (Black, Spence, and Omari, 2004). Much of the work of early\\npsychologists from diverse backgrounds was dedicated to challenging intelligence testing and promoting\\ninnovative educational methods for children. George I. Sanchez contested such testing with Mexican American\\nchildren. As a psychologist of Mexican heritage, he pointed out that the language and cultural barriers in\\ntesting were keeping children from equal opportunities (Guthrie, 1998). By 1940, he was teaching with his\\ndoctoral degree at University of Texas at Austin and challenging segregated educational practices (Romo,\\n1986).\\nTwo famous African American researchers and psychologists are Mamie Phipps Clark and her husband,\\nKenneth Clark. They are best known for their studies conducted on African American children and doll\\npreference, research that was instrumental in the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court desegregation\\ncase. The Clarks applied their research to social services and opened the first child guidance center in Harlem\\n(American Psychological Association, 2019).\\nListen to the podcast below describing the Clarks\\' research and impact on the Supreme Court decision.\\n1.2 • History of Psychology 17\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nListen to a podcast about the influence of an African American\\'s psychology research on the historic Brown v.\\nBoard of Education civil rights case (http://openstax.org/l/crogers2) to learn more.\\nThe American Psychological Association has several ethnically based organizations for professional\\npsychologists that facilitate interactions among members. Since psychologists belonging to specific ethnic\\ngroups or cultures have the most interest in studying the psychology of their communities, these organizations\\nprovide an opportunity for the growth of research on the interplay between culture and psychology.\\nWOMEN IN PSYCHOLOGY\\nAlthough rarely given credit, women have been contributing to psychology since its inception as a field of\\nstudy. In 1894, Margaret Floy Washburn was the first woman awarded the doctoral degree in psychology. She\\nwrote The Animal Mind: A Textbook of Comparative Psychology, and it was the standard in the field for over 20\\nyears. In the mid 1890s, Mary Whiton Calkins completed all requirements toward the PhD in psychology, but\\nHarvard University refused to award her that degree because she was a woman. She had been taught and\\nmentored by William James, who tried and failed to convince Harvard to award her the doctoral degree. Her\\nmemory research studied primacy and recency (Madigan & O’Hara, 1992), and she also wrote about how\\nstructuralism and functionalism both explained self-psychology (Calkins, 1906).\\nAnother influential woman, Mary Cover Jones, conducted a study she considered to be a sequel to John B.\\nWatson’s study of Little Albert (you’ll learn about this study in the chapter on Learning). Jones unconditioned\\nfear in Little Peter, who had been afraid of rabbits (Jones, 1924).\\nEthnic minority women contributing to the field of psychology include Martha Bernal and Inez Beverly Prosser;\\ntheir studies were related to education. Bernal, the first Latina to earn her doctoral degree in psychology\\n(1962) conducted much of her research with Mexican American children. Prosser was the first African\\nAmerican woman awarded the PhD in 1933 at the University of Cincinnati (Benjamin, Henry, & McMahon,\\n2005).\\n1.3 Contemporary Psychology\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Appreciate the diversity of interests and foci within psychology\\n• Understand basic interests and applications in each of the described areas of psychology\\n• Demonstrate familiarity with some of the major concepts or important figures in each of the described areas of\\npsychology\\nContemporary psychology is a diverse field that is influenced by all of the historical perspectives described in\\nthe preceding section. Reflective of the discipline’s diversity is the diversity seen within the American\\nPsychological Association (APA). The APA is a professional organization representing psychologists in the\\nUnited States. The APA is the largest organization of psychologists in the world, and its mission is to advance\\nand disseminate psychological knowledge for the betterment of people. There are 54 divisions within the APA,\\nrepresenting a wide variety of specialties that range from Societies for the Psychology of Religion and\\nSpirituality to Exercise and Sport Psychology to Behavioral Neuroscience and Comparative Psychology.\\nReflecting the diversity of the field of psychology itself, members, affiliate members, and associate members\\nspan the spectrum from students to doctoral-level psychologists, and come from a variety of places including\\neducational settings, criminal justice, hospitals, the armed forces, and industry (American Psychological\\nAssociation, 2014). G. Stanley Hall was the first president of the APA. Before he earned his doctoral degree, he\\nwas an adjunct instructor at Wilberforce University, a historically Black college/university (HBCU), while\\nserving as faculty at Antioch College. Hall went on to work under William James, earning his PhD. Eventually,\\n18 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nhe became the first president of Clark University in Massachusetts when it was founded (Pickren & Rutherford,\\n2010).\\nThe Association for Psychological Science (APS) was founded in 1988 and seeks to advance the scientific\\norientation of psychology. Its founding resulted from disagreements between members of the scientific and\\nclinical branches of psychology within the APA. The APS publishes five research journals and engages in\\neducation and advocacy with funding agencies. A significant proportion of its members are international,\\nalthough the majority is located in the United States. Other organizations provide networking and\\ncollaboration opportunities for professionals of several ethnic or racial groups working in psychology, such as\\nthe National Latina/o Psychological Association (NLPA), the Asian American Psychological Association (AAPA),\\nthe Association of Black Psychologists (ABPsi), and the Society of Indian Psychologists (SIP). Most of these\\ngroups are also dedicated to studying psychological and social issues within their specific communities.\\nThis section will provide an overview of the major subdivisions within psychology today in the order in which\\nthey are introduced throughout the remainder of this textbook. This is not meant to be an exhaustive listing,\\nbut it will provide insight into the major areas of research and practice of modern-day psychologists.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nPlease visit this website about the divisions within the APA (http://openstax.org/l/biopsychology) to learn more.\\nView these student resources (http://openstax.org/l/studentresource) also provided by the APA.\\nBiopsychology and Evolutionary Psychology\\nAs the name suggests, biopsychology explores how our biology influences our behavior. While biological\\npsychology is a broad field, many biological psychologists want to understand how the structure and function\\nof the nervous system is related to behavior (Figure 1.10). As such, they often combine the research strategies\\nof both psychologists and physiologists to accomplish this goal (as discussed in Carlson, 2013).\\nFIGURE 1.10 Biological psychologists study how the structure and function of the nervous system generate\\nbehavior.\\nThe research interests of biological psychologists span a number of domains, including but not limited to,\\n1.3 • Contemporary Psychology 19\\nsensory and motor systems, sleep, drug use and abuse, ingestive behavior, reproductive behavior,\\nneurodevelopment, plasticity of the nervous system, and biological correlates of psychological disorders.\\nGiven the broad areas of interest falling under the purview of biological psychology, it will probably come as no\\nsurprise that individuals from all sorts of backgrounds are involved in this research, including biologists,\\nmedical professionals, physiologists, and chemists. This interdisciplinary approach is often referred to as\\nneuroscience, of which biological psychology is a component (Carlson, 2013).\\nWhile biopsychology typically focuses on the immediate causes of behavior based in the physiology of a\\nhuman or other animal, evolutionary psychology seeks to study the ultimate biological causes of behavior. To\\nthe extent that a behavior is impacted by genetics, a behavior, like any anatomical characteristic of a human or\\nanimal, will demonstrate adaption to its surroundings. These surroundings include the physical environment\\nand, since interactions between organisms can be important to survival and reproduction, the social\\nenvironment. The study of behavior in the context of evolution has its origins with Charles Darwin, the co-\\ndiscoverer of the theory of evolution by natural selection. Darwin was well aware that behaviors should be\\nadaptive and wrote books titled, The Descent of Man (1871) and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and\\nAnimals (1872), to explore this field.\\nEvolutionary psychology, and specifically, the evolutionary psychology of humans, has enjoyed a resurgence in\\nrecent decades. To be subject to evolution by natural selection, a behavior must have a significant genetic\\ncause. In general, we expect all human cultures to express a behavior if it is caused genetically, since the\\ngenetic differences among human groups are small. The approach taken by most evolutionary psychologists is\\nto predict the outcome of a behavior in a particular situation based on evolutionary theory and then to make\\nobservations, or conduct experiments, to determine whether the results match the theory. It is important to\\nrecognize that these types of studies are not strong evidence that a behavior is adaptive, since they lack\\ninformation that the behavior is in some part genetic and not entirely cultural (Endler, 1986). Demonstrating\\nthat a trait, especially in humans, is naturally selected is extraordinarily difficult; perhaps for this reason,\\nsome evolutionary psychologists are content to assume the behaviors they study have genetic determinants\\n(Confer et al., 2010).\\nOne other drawback of evolutionary psychology is that the traits that we possess now evolved under\\nenvironmental and social conditions far back in human history, and we have a poor understanding of what\\nthese conditions were. This makes predictions about what is adaptive for a behavior difficult. Behavioral traits\\nneed not be adaptive under current conditions, only under the conditions of the past when they evolved, about\\nwhich we can only hypothesize.\\nThere are many areas of human behavior for which evolution can make predictions. Examples include\\nmemory, mate choice, relationships between kin, friendship and cooperation, parenting, social organization,\\nand status (Confer et al., 2010).\\nEvolutionary psychologists have had success in finding experimental correspondence between observations\\nand expectations. In one example, in a study of mate preference differences between men and women that\\nspanned 37 cultures, Buss (1989) found that women valued earning potential factors greater than men, and\\nmen valued potential reproductive factors (youth and attractiveness) greater than women in their prospective\\nmates. In general, the predictions were in line with the predictions of evolution, although there were deviations\\nin some cultures.\\nSensation and Perception\\nScientists interested in both physiological aspects of sensory systems as well as in the psychological\\nexperience of sensory information work within the area of sensation and perception (Figure 1.11). As such,\\nsensation and perception research is also quite interdisciplinary. Imagine walking between buildings as you\\nmove from one class to another. You are inundated with sights, sounds, touch sensations, and smells. You also\\nexperience the temperature of the air around you and maintain your balance as you make your way. These are\\n20 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nall factors of interest to someone working in the domain of sensation and perception.\\nFIGURE 1.11 When you look at this image, you may see a duck or a rabbit. The sensory information remains the\\nsame, but your perception can vary dramatically.\\nAs described in a later chapter that focuses on the results of studies in sensation and perception, our\\nexperience of our world is not as simple as the sum total of all of the sensory information (or sensations)\\ntogether. Rather, our experience (or perception) is complex and is influenced by where we focus our attention,\\nour previous experiences, and even our cultural backgrounds.\\nCognitive Psychology\\nAs mentioned in the previous section, the cognitive revolution created an impetus for psychologists to focus\\ntheir attention on better understanding the mind and mental processes that underlie behavior. Thus, cognitive\\npsychology is the area of psychology that focuses on studying cognitions, or thoughts, and their relationship to\\nour experiences and our actions. Like biological psychology, cognitive psychology is broad in its scope and\\noften involves collaborations among people from a diverse range of disciplinary backgrounds. This has led\\nsome to coin the term cognitive science to describe the interdisciplinary nature of this area of research (Miller,\\n2003).\\nCognitive psychologists have research interests that span a spectrum of topics, ranging from attention to\\nproblem solving to language to memory. The approaches used in studying these topics are equally diverse.\\nGiven such diversity, cognitive psychology is not captured in one chapter of this text per se; rather, various\\nconcepts related to cognitive psychology will be covered in relevant portions of the chapters in this text on\\nsensation and perception, thinking and intelligence, memory, lifespan development, social psychology, and\\ntherapy.\\nDevelopmental Psychology\\nDevelopmental psychology is the scientific study of development across a lifespan. Developmental\\npsychologists are interested in processes related to physical maturation. However, their focus is not limited to\\nthe physical changes associated with aging, as they also focus on changes in cognitive skills, moral reasoning,\\nsocial behavior, and other psychological attributes.\\nEarly developmental psychologists focused primarily on changes that occurred through reaching adulthood,\\nproviding enormous insight into the differences in physical, cognitive, and social capacities that exist between\\nvery young children and adults. For instance, research by Jean Piaget (Figure 1.12) demonstrated that very\\nyoung children do not demonstrate object permanence. Object permanence refers to the understanding that\\nphysical things continue to exist, even if they are hidden from us. If you were to show an adult a toy, and then\\nhide it behind a curtain, the adult knows that the toy still exists. However, very young infants act as if a hidden\\nobject no longer exists. The age at which object permanence is achieved is somewhat controversial (Munakata,\\nMcClelland, Johnson, and Siegler, 1997).\\n1.3 • Contemporary Psychology 21\\nFIGURE 1.13 Each of the dimensions of the Five Factor model is shown in this figure. The provided description\\nwould describe someone who scored highly on that given dimension. Someone with a lower score on a given\\ndimension could be described in opposite terms.\\nSocial Psychology\\nSocial psychology focuses on how we interact with and relate to others. Social psychologists conduct research\\non a wide variety of topics that include differences in how we explain our own behavior versus how we explain\\nthe behaviors of others, prejudice, and attraction, and how we resolve interpersonal conflicts. Social\\npsychologists have also sought to determine how being among other people changes our own behavior and\\npatterns of thinking.\\nThere are many interesting examples of social psychological research, and you will read about many of these\\nin a later chapter of this textbook. Until then, you will be introduced to one of the most controversial\\npsychological studies ever conducted. Stanley Milgram was an American social psychologist who is most\\nfamous for research that he conducted on obedience. After the holocaust, in 1961, a Nazi war criminal, Adolf\\nEichmann, who was accused of committing mass atrocities, was put on trial. Many people wondered how\\nGerman soldiers were capable of torturing prisoners in concentration camps, and they were unsatisfied with\\nthe excuses given by soldiers that they were simply following orders. At the time, most psychologists agreed\\nthat few people would be willing to inflict such extraordinary pain and suffering, simply because they were\\nobeying orders. Milgram decided to conduct research to determine whether or not this was true (Figure 1.14).\\nAs you will read later in the text, Milgram found that nearly two-thirds of his participants were willing to\\ndeliver what they believed to be lethal shocks to another person, simply because they were instructed to do so\\nby an authority figure (in this case, a man dressed in a lab coat). This was in spite of the fact that participants\\n1.3 • Contemporary Psychology 23\\nreceived payment for simply showing up for the research study and could have chosen not to inflict pain or\\nmore serious consequences on another person by withdrawing from the study. No one was actually hurt or\\nharmed in any way, Milgram’s experiment was a clever ruse that took advantage of research confederates,\\nthose who pretend to be participants in a research study who are actually working for the researcher and have\\nclear, specific directions on how to behave during the research study (Hock, 2009). Milgram’s and others’\\nstudies that involved deception and potential emotional harm to study participants catalyzed the development\\nof ethical guidelines for conducting psychological research that discourage the use of deception of research\\nsubjects, unless it can be argued not to cause harm and, in general, requiring informed consent of\\nparticipants.\\nFIGURE 1.14 Stanley Milgram’s research demonstrated just how far people will go in obeying orders from an\\nauthority figure. This advertisement was used to recruit subjects for his research.\\nIndustrial-Organizational Psychology\\nIndustrial-Organizational psychology (I-O psychology) is a subfield of psychology that applies psychological\\ntheories, principles, and research findings in industrial and organizational settings. I-O psychologists are often\\ninvolved in issues related to personnel management, organizational structure, and workplace environment.\\nBusinesses often seek the aid of I-O psychologists to make the best hiring decisions as well as to create an\\nenvironment that results in high levels of employee productivity and efficiency. In addition to its applied\\nnature, I-O psychology also involves conducting scientific research on behavior within I-O settings (Riggio,\\n2013).\\n24 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nHealth Psychology\\nHealth psychology focuses on how health is affected by the interaction of biological, psychological, and\\nsociocultural factors. This particular approach is known as the biopsychosocial model (Figure 1.15). Health\\npsychologists are interested in helping individuals achieve better health through public policy, education,\\nintervention, and research. Health psychologists might conduct research that explores the relationship\\nbetween one’s genetic makeup, patterns of behavior, relationships, psychological stress, and health. They may\\nresearch effective ways to motivate people to address patterns of behavior that contribute to poorer health\\n(MacDonald, 2013).\\nFIGURE 1.15 The biopsychosocial model suggests that health/illness is determined by an interaction of these three\\nfactors.\\nSport and Exercise Psychology\\nResearchers in sport and exercise psychology study the psychological aspects of sport performance,\\nincluding motivation and performance anxiety, and the effects of sport on mental and emotional wellbeing.\\nResearch is also conducted on similar topics as they relate to physical exercise in general. The discipline also\\nincludes topics that are broader than sport and exercise but that are related to interactions between mental\\nand physical performance under demanding conditions, such as fire fighting, military operations, artistic\\nperformance, and surgery.\\nClinical Psychology\\nClinical psychology is the area of psychology that focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of psychological\\ndisorders and other problematic patterns of behavior. As such, it is generally considered to be a more applied\\narea within psychology; however, some clinicians are also actively engaged in scientific research. Counseling\\npsychology is a similar discipline that focuses on emotional, social, vocational, and health-related outcomes in\\nindividuals who are considered psychologically healthy.\\nAs mentioned earlier, both Freud and Rogers provided perspectives that have been influential in shaping how\\nclinicians interact with people seeking psychotherapy. While aspects of the psychoanalytic theory are still\\nfound among some of today’s therapists who are trained from a psychodynamic perspective, Roger’s ideas\\nabout client-centered therapy have been especially influential in shaping how many clinicians operate.\\nFurthermore, both behaviorism and the cognitive revolution have shaped clinical practice in the forms of\\nbehavioral therapy, cognitive therapy, and cognitive-behavioral therapy (Figure 1.16). Issues related to the\\ndiagnosis and treatment of psychological disorders and problematic patterns of behavior will be discussed in\\n1.3 • Contemporary Psychology 25\\ndetail in later chapters of this textbook.\\nFIGURE 1.16 Cognitive-behavioral therapists take cognitive processes and behaviors into account when providing\\npsychotherapy. This is one of several strategies that may be used by practicing clinical psychologists.\\nBy far, this is the area of psychology that receives the most attention in popular media, and many people\\nmistakenly assume that all psychology is clinical psychology.\\nForensic Psychology\\nForensic psychology is a branch of psychology that deals questions of psychology as they arise in the context\\nof the justice system. For example, forensic psychologists (and forensic psychiatrists) will assess a person’s\\ncompetency to stand trial, assess the state of mind of a defendant, act as consultants on child custody cases,\\nconsult on sentencing and treatment recommendations, and advise on issues such as eyewitness testimony\\nand children’s testimony (American Board of Forensic Psychology, 2014). In these capacities, they will typically\\nact as expert witnesses, called by either side in a court case to provide their research- or experience-based\\nopinions. As expert witnesses, forensic psychologists must have a good understanding of the law and provide\\ninformation in the context of the legal system rather than just within the realm of psychology. Forensic\\npsychologists are also used in the jury selection process and witness preparation. They may also be involved in\\nproviding psychological treatment within the criminal justice system. Criminal profilers are a relatively small\\nproportion of psychologists that act as consultants to law enforcement.\\n1.4 Careers in Psychology\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Understand educational requirements for careers in academic settings\\n• Understand the demands of a career in an academic setting\\n• Understand career options outside of academic settings\\nPsychologists can work in many different places doing many different things. In general, anyone wishing to\\ncontinue a career in psychology at a 4-year institution of higher education will have to earn a doctoral degree\\nin psychology for some specialties and at least a master’s degree for others. In most areas of psychology, this\\nmeans earning a PhD in a relevant area of psychology. Literally, PhD refers to a doctor of philosophy degree,\\nbut here, philosophy does not refer to the field of philosophy per se. Rather, philosophy in this context refers to\\nmany different disciplinary perspectives that would be housed in a traditional college of liberal arts and\\nsciences.\\nThe requirements to earn a PhD vary from country to country and even from school to school, but usually,\\nindividuals earning this degree must complete a dissertation. A dissertation is essentially a long research\\npaper or bundled published articles describing research that was conducted as a part of the candidate’s\\ndoctoral training. In the United States, a dissertation generally has to be defended before a committee of expert\\n26 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nreviewers before the degree is conferred (Figure 1.17).\\nFIGURE 1.17 Doctoral degrees are generally conferred in formal ceremonies involving special attire and rites.\\n(credit: Public Affairs Office Fort Wainwright)\\nOnce someone earns a PhD, they may seek a faculty appointment at a college or university. Being on the faculty\\nof a college or university often involves dividing time between teaching, research, and service to the institution\\nand profession. The amount of time spent on each of these primary responsibilities varies dramatically from\\nschool to school, and it is not uncommon for faculty to move from place to place in search of the best personal\\nfit among various academic environments. The previous section detailed some of the major areas that are\\ncommonly represented in psychology departments around the country; thus, depending on the training\\nreceived, an individual could be anything from a biological psychologist to a clinical psychologist in an\\nacademic setting (Figure 1.18).\\nFIGURE 1.18 Individuals earning a PhD in psychology have a range of employment options.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nUse this interactive tool and explore different careers in psychology based on degree levels\\n(http://openstax.org/l/degreecareer) to learn more.\\nOther Careers in Academic Settings\\nOften times, schools offer more courses in psychology than their full-time faculty can teach.

While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember what he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is associated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend’s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John Nash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would tell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended for him. He also began to hear voices in his head that he could not control. When he tried to stop them, they would come back to him, and when he did not want them to, the voices would leave him (Wearing, n.d.). These are just a few of the many examples of how people experience the world around them in ways that are unpredictable and difficult to understand. In this chapter, we will explore what psychology is, what it is not, and how it has evolved over time. We will also look at some common misconceptions about psychology. Finally, we will discuss some careers in psychology and the role that psychology plays in our lives. 2. WHAT IS PSYCHOLOGY? The word “psychology” comes from two Greek words, “psyche” and “logos,” which mean “mind” or “thinking.” Psychologists are interested in how the mind works and how we think and feel. They study the mental processes that occur in the brain, such as perception, attention, memory, thinking, problem solving, emotion, motivation, learning, decision making, self-regulation, personality, social behavior, etc. Psychologists use a variety of methods to study these processes, including observation, experiments, surveys, interviews, questionnaires, brain imaging, neuropsychology, cognitive neuroscience, psychometrics, clinical psychology, developmental psychology, ethnopsychology and social psychology. Psychology has a long and rich history. It has been practiced for thousands of years in many different cultures and societies. For example, in ancient Greece, Plato and Aristotle studied psychology in order to understand the nature of human beings and their relationships with each other and with their environment. In the Middle Ages, Christian theologians and philosophers used psychology as a tool for understanding the nature of God and his relationship with his creatures. During the Renaissance, scientists and thinkers such as Galileo Galilei, Isaac Newton, René Descartes, John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Auguste Comte, Jean-Paul Sartre, Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, William James, Edward Thorndike, B.F. Skinner and others developed theories of psychology that continue to shape our understanding of this field today. Today, psychology is a broad and diverse field that encompasses a wide range of subfields and disciplines. Some of these disciplines include: • Clinical psychology: This field focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders, as well as', 'references': '{\"sections\": [\"Psychological Research/Why Is Research Important?\", \"Introduction to Psychology\", \"Introduction to Psychology/Contemporary Psychology\"], \"pages\": [\"37\", \"31\", \"20\"]}'}\n",

Since psychologists belonging to specific ethnic\\ngroups or cultures have the most interest in studying the psychology of their communities, these organizations\\nprovide an opportunity for the growth of research on the interplay between culture and psychology.\\nWOMEN IN PSYCHOLOGY\\nAlthough rarely given credit, women have been contributing to psychology since its inception as a field of\\nstudy. In 1894, Margaret Floy Washburn was the first woman awarded the doctoral degree in psychology. She\\nwrote The Animal Mind: A Textbook of Comparative Psychology, and it was the standard in the field for over 20\\nyears. In the mid 1890s, Mary Whiton Calkins completed all requirements toward the PhD in psychology, but\\nHarvard University refused to award her that degree because she was a woman. She had been taught and\\nmentored by William James, who tried and failed to convince Harvard to award her the doctoral degree. Her\\nmemory research studied primacy and recency (Madigan & O’Hara, 1992), and she also wrote about how\\nstructuralism and functionalism both explained self-psychology (Calkins, 1906).\\nAnother influential woman, Mary Cover Jones, conducted a study she considered to be a sequel to John B.\\nWatson’s study of Little Albert (you’ll learn about this study in the chapter on Learning). Jones unconditioned\\nfear in Little Peter, who had been afraid of rabbits (Jones, 1924).\\nEthnic minority women contributing to the field of psychology include Martha Bernal and Inez Beverly Prosser;\\ntheir studies were related to education.

Prosser was the first African\\nAmerican woman awarded the PhD in 1933 at the University of Cincinnati (Benjamin, Henry, & McMahon,\\n2005).\\n1.3 Contemporary Psychology\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Appreciate the diversity of interests and foci within psychology\\n• Understand basic interests and applications in each of the described areas of psychology\\n• Demonstrate familiarity with some of the major concepts or important figures in each of the described areas of\\npsychology\\nContemporary psychology is a diverse field that is influenced by all of the historical perspectives described in\\nthe preceding section. Reflective of the discipline’s diversity is the diversity seen within the American\\nPsychological Association (APA). The APA is a professional organization representing psychologists in the\\nUnited States. The APA is the largest organization of psychologists in the world, and its mission is to advance\\nand disseminate psychological knowledge for the betterment of people. There are 54 divisions within the APA,\\nrepresenting a wide variety of specialties that range from Societies for the Psychology of Religion and\\nSpirituality to Exercise and Sport Psychology to Behavioral Neuroscience and Comparative Psychology.\\nReflecting the diversity of the field of psychology itself, members, affiliate members, and associate members\\nspan the spectrum from students to doctoral-level psychologists, and come from a variety of places including\\neducational settings, criminal justice, hospitals, the armed forces, and industry (American Psychological\\nAssociation, 2014). G. Stanley Hall was the first president of the APA. Before he earned his doctoral degree, he\\nwas an adjunct instructor at Wilberforce University, a historically Black college/university (HBCU), while\\nserving as faculty at Antioch College. Hall went on to work under William James, earning his PhD. Eventually,\\n18 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nhe became the first president of Clark University in Massachusetts when it was founded (Pickren & Rutherford,\\n2010).\\nThe Association for Psychological Science (APS) was founded in 1988 and seeks to advance the scientific\\norientation of psychology. Its founding resulted from disagreements between members of the scientific and\\nclinical branches of psychology within the APA. The APS publishes five research journals and engages in\\neducation and advocacy with funding agencies. A significant proportion of its members are international,\\nalthough the majority is located in the United States. Other organizations provide networking and\\ncollaboration opportunities for professionals of several ethnic or racial groups working in psychology, such as\\nthe National Latina/o Psychological Association (NLPA), the Asian American Psychological Association (AAPA),\\nthe Association of Black Psychologists (ABPsi), and the Society of Indian Psychologists (SIP). Most of these\\ngroups are also dedicated to studying psychological and social issues within their specific communities.\\nThis section will provide an overview of the major subdivisions within psychology today in the order in which\\nthey are introduced throughout the remainder of this textbook. This is not meant to be an exhaustive listing,\\nbut it will provide insight into the major areas of research and practice of modern-day psychologists.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nPlease visit this website about the divisions within the APA (http://openstax.org/l/biopsychology) to learn more.\\nView these student resources (http://openstax.org/l/studentresource) also provided by the APA.\\nBiopsychology and Evolutionary Psychology\\nAs the name suggests, biopsychology explores how our biology influences our behavior. While biological\\npsychology is a broad field, many biological psychologists want to understand how the structure and function\\nof the nervous system is related to behavior (Figure 1.10). As such, they often combine the research strategies\\nof both psychologists and physiologists to accomplish this goal (as discussed in Carlson, 2013).\\nFIGURE 1.10 Biological psychologists study how the structure and function of the nervous system generate\\nbehavior.\\nThe research interests of biological psychologists span a number of domains, including but not limited to,\\n1.3 • Contemporary Psychology 19\\nsensory and motor systems, sleep, drug use and abuse, ingestive behavior, reproductive behavior,\\nneurodevelopment, plasticity of the nervous system, and biological correlates of psychological disorders.\\nGiven the broad areas of interest falling under the purview of biological psychology, it will probably come as no\\nsurprise that individuals from all sorts of backgrounds are involved in this research, including biologists,\\nmedical professionals, physiologists, and chemists. This interdisciplinary approach is often referred to as\\nneuroscience, of which biological psychology is a component (Carlson, 2013).\\nWhile biopsychology typically focuses on the immediate causes of behavior based in the physiology of a\\nhuman or other animal, evolutionary psychology seeks to study the ultimate biological causes of behavior. To\\nthe extent that a behavior is impacted by genetics, a behavior, like any anatomical characteristic of a human or\\nanimal, will demonstrate adaption to its surroundings. These surroundings include the physical environment\\nand, since interactions between organisms can be important to survival and reproduction, the social\\nenvironment. The study of behavior in the context of evolution has its origins with Charles Darwin, the co-\\ndiscoverer of the theory of evolution by natural selection. Darwin was well aware that behaviors should be\\nadaptive and wrote books titled, The Descent of Man (1871) and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and\\nAnimals (1872), to explore this field.\\nEvolutionary psychology, and specifically, the evolutionary psychology of humans, has enjoyed a resurgence in\\nrecent decades. To be subject to evolution by natural selection, a behavior must have a significant genetic\\ncause. In general, we expect all human cultures to express a behavior if it is caused genetically, since the\\ngenetic differences among human groups are small. The approach taken by most evolutionary psychologists is\\nto predict the outcome of a behavior in a particular situation based on evolutionary theory and then to make\\nobservations, or conduct experiments, to determine whether the results match the theory. It is important to\\nrecognize that these types of studies are not strong evidence that a behavior is adaptive, since they lack\\ninformation that the behavior is in some part genetic and not entirely cultural (Endler, 1986). Demonstrating\\nthat a trait, especially in humans, is naturally selected is extraordinarily difficult; perhaps for this reason,\\nsome evolutionary psychologists are content to assume the behaviors they study have genetic determinants\\n(Confer et al., 2010).\\nOne other drawback of evolutionary psychology is that the traits that we possess now evolved under\\nenvironmental and social conditions far back in human history, and we have a poor understanding of what\\nthese conditions were. This makes predictions about what is adaptive for a behavior difficult. Behavioral traits\\nneed not be adaptive under current conditions, only under the conditions of the past when they evolved, about\\nwhich we can only hypothesize.\\nThere are many areas of human behavior for which evolution can make predictions. Examples include\\nmemory, mate choice, relationships between kin, friendship and cooperation, parenting, social organization,\\nand status (Confer et al., 2010).\\nEvolutionary psychologists have had success in finding experimental correspondence between observations\\nand expectations. In one example, in a study of mate preference differences between men and women that\\nspanned 37 cultures, Buss (1989) found that women valued earning potential factors greater than men, and\\nmen valued potential reproductive factors (youth and attractiveness) greater than women in their prospective\\nmates. In general, the predictions were in line with the predictions of evolution, although there were deviations\\nin some cultures.\\nSensation and Perception\\nScientists interested in both physiological aspects of sensory systems as well as in the psychological\\nexperience of sensory information work within the area of sensation and perception (Figure 1.11). As such,\\nsensation and perception research is also quite interdisciplinary. Imagine walking between buildings as you\\nmove from one class to another. You are inundated with sights, sounds, touch sensations, and smells. You also\\nexperience the temperature of the air around you and maintain your balance as you make your way. These are\\n20 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nall factors of interest to someone working in the domain of sensation and perception.\\nFIGURE 1.11 When you look at this image, you may see a duck or a rabbit. The sensory information remains the\\nsame, but your perception can vary dramatically.\\nAs described in a later chapter that focuses on the results of studies in sensation and perception, our\\nexperience of our world is not as simple as the sum total of all of the sensory information (or sensations)\\ntogether. Rather, our experience (or perception) is complex and is influenced by where we focus our attention,\\nour previous experiences, and even our cultural backgrounds.\\nCognitive Psychology\\nAs mentioned in the previous section, the cognitive revolution created an impetus for psychologists to focus\\ntheir attention on better understanding the mind and mental processes that underlie behavior. Thus, cognitive\\npsychology is the area of psychology that focuses on studying cognitions, or thoughts, and their relationship to\\nour experiences and our actions. Like biological psychology, cognitive psychology is broad in its scope and\\noften involves collaborations among people from a diverse range of disciplinary backgrounds. This has led\\nsome to coin the term cognitive science to describe the interdisciplinary nature of this area of research (Miller,\\n2003).\\nCognitive psychologists have research interests that span a spectrum of topics, ranging from attention to\\nproblem solving to language to memory. The approaches used in studying these topics are equally diverse.\\nGiven such diversity, cognitive psychology is not captured in one chapter of this text per se; rather, various\\nconcepts related to cognitive psychology will be covered in relevant portions of the chapters in this text on\\nsensation and perception, thinking and intelligence, memory, lifespan development, social psychology, and\\ntherapy.\\nDevelopmental Psychology\\nDevelopmental psychology is the scientific study of development across a lifespan. Developmental\\npsychologists are interested in processes related to physical maturation. However, their focus is not limited to\\nthe physical changes associated with aging, as they also focus on changes in cognitive skills, moral reasoning,\\nsocial behavior, and other psychological attributes.\\nEarly developmental psychologists focused primarily on changes that occurred through reaching adulthood,\\nproviding enormous insight into the differences in physical, cognitive, and social capacities that exist between\\nvery young children and adults. For instance, research by Jean Piaget (Figure 1.12) demonstrated that very\\nyoung children do not demonstrate object permanence. Object permanence refers to the understanding that\\nphysical things continue to exist, even if they are hidden from us. If you were to show an adult a toy, and then\\nhide it behind a curtain, the adult knows that the toy still exists. However, very young infants act as if a hidden\\nobject no longer exists. The age at which object permanence is achieved is somewhat controversial (Munakata,\\nMcClelland, Johnson, and Siegler, 1997).\\n1.3 • Contemporary Psychology 21\\nFIGURE 1.12 Jean Piaget is famous for his theories regarding changes in cognitive ability that occur as we move\\nfrom infancy to adulthood.\\nWhile Piaget was focused on cognitive changes during infancy and childhood as we move to adulthood, there is\\nan increasing interest in extending research into the changes that occur much later in life. This may be\\nreflective of changing population demographics of developed nations as a whole. As more and more people live\\nlonger lives, the number of people of advanced age will continue to increase. Indeed, it is estimated that there\\nwere just over 40 million people aged 65 or older living in the United States in 2010. However, by 2020, this\\nnumber is expected to increase to about 55 million. By the year 2050, it is estimated that nearly 90 million\\npeople in this country will be 65 or older (Department of Health and Human Services, n.d.).\\nPersonality Psychology\\nPersonality psychology focuses on patterns of thoughts and behaviors that make each individual unique.\\nSeveral individuals (e.g., Freud and Maslow) that we have already discussed in our historical overview of\\npsychology, and the American psychologist Gordon Allport, contributed to early theories of personality. These\\nearly theorists attempted to explain how an individual’s personality develops from their given perspective. For\\nexample, Freud proposed that personality arose as conflicts between the conscious and unconscious parts of\\nthe mind were carried out over the lifespan. Specifically, Freud theorized that an individual went through\\nvarious psychosexual stages of development. According to Freud, adult personality would result from the\\nresolution of various conflicts that centered on the migration of erogenous (or sexual pleasure-producing)\\nzones from the oral (mouth) to the anus to the phallus to the genitals. Like many of Freud’s theories, this\\nparticular idea was controversial and did not lend itself to experimental tests (Person, 1980).\\nMore recently, the study of personality has taken on a more quantitative approach. Rather than explaining how\\npersonality arises, research is focused on identifying personality traits, measuring these traits, and\\ndetermining how these traits interact in a particular context to determine how a person will behave in any\\ngiven situation. Personality traits are relatively consistent patterns of thought and behavior, and many have\\nproposed that five trait dimensions are sufficient to capture the variations in personality seen across\\nindividuals. These five dimensions are known as the “Big Five” or the Five Factor model, and include\\ndimensions of conscientiousness, agreeableness, neuroticism, openness, and extraversion (Figure 1.13). Each\\nof these traits has been demonstrated to be relatively stable over the lifespan (e.g., Rantanen, Metsäpelto, Feldt,\\nPulkinnen, and Kokko, 2007; Soldz & Vaillant, 1999; McCrae & Costa, 2008) and is influenced by genetics (e.g.,\\nJang, Livesly, and Vernon, 1996).\\n22 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\n3.1 Human Genetics\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Explain the basic principles of the theory of evolution by natural selection\\n• Describe the differences between genotype and phenotype\\n• Discuss how gene-environment interactions are critical for expression of physical and psychological\\ncharacteristics\\nPsychological researchers study genetics in order to better understand the biological factors that contribute to\\ncertain behaviors. While all humans share certain biological mechanisms, we are each unique. And while our\\nbodies have many of the same parts—brains and hormones and cells with genetic codes—these are expressed\\nin a wide variety of behaviors, thoughts, and reactions.\\nWhy do two people infected by the same disease have different outcomes: one surviving and one succumbing\\nto the ailment? How are genetic diseases passed through family lines? Are there genetic components to\\npsychological disorders, such as depression or schizophrenia? To what extent might there be a psychological\\nbasis to health conditions such as childhood obesity?\\nTo explore these questions, let’s start by focusing on a specific genetic disorder, sickle cell anemia, and how it\\nmight manifest in two affected sisters. Sickle-cell anemia is a genetic condition in which red blood cells, which\\nare normally round, take on a crescent-like shape (Figure 3.2). The changed shape of these cells affects how\\nthey function: sickle-shaped cells can clog blood vessels and block blood flow, leading to high fever, severe\\npain, swelling, and tissue damage.\\nFIGURE 3.2 Normal blood cells travel freely through the blood vessels, while sickle-shaped cells form blockages\\npreventing blood flow.\\nMany people with sickle-cell anemia—and the particular genetic mutation that causes it—die at an early age.\\nWhile the notion of “survival of the fittest” may suggest that people with this disorder have a low survival rate\\nand therefore the disorder will become less common, this is not the case. Despite the negative evolutionary\\neffects associated with this genetic mutation, the sickle-cell gene remains relatively common among people of\\nAfrican descent. Why is this? The explanation is illustrated with the following scenario.\\nImagine two young women—Luwi and Sena—sisters in rural Zambia, Africa. Luwi carries the gene for sickle-\\ncell anemia; Sena does not carry the gene. Sickle-cell carriers have one copy of the sickle-cell gene but do not\\nhave full-blown sickle-cell anemia. They experience symptoms only if they are severely dehydrated or are\\ndeprived of oxygen (as in mountain climbing). Carriers are thought to be immune from malaria (an often\\ndeadly disease that is widespread in tropical climates) because changes in their blood chemistry and immune\\nfunctioning prevent the malaria parasite from having its effects (Gong, Parikh, Rosenthal, & Greenhouse,\\n2013). However, full-blown sickle-cell anemia, with two copies of the sickle-cell gene, does not provide\\nimmunity to malaria.\\n72 3 • Biopsychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nWhile walking home from school, both sisters are bitten by mosquitoes carrying the malaria parasite. Luwi is\\nprotected against malaria because she carries the sickle-cell mutation. Sena, on the other hand, develops\\nmalaria and dies just two weeks later. Luwi survives and eventually has children, to whom she may pass on the\\nsickle-cell mutation.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nVisit this website about how a mutation in DNA leads to sickle cell anemia (http://openstax.org/l/sickle1) to\\nlearn more.\\nMalaria is rare in the United States, so the sickle-cell gene benefits nobody: the gene manifests primarily in\\nminor health problems for carriers with one copy, or a severe full-blown disease with no health benefits for\\ncarriers with two copies. However, the situation is quite different in other parts of the world. In parts of Africa\\nwhere malaria is prevalent, having the sickle-cell mutation does provide health benefits for carriers\\n(protection from malaria).\\nThe story of malaria fits with Charles Darwin\\'s theory of evolution by natural selection (Figure 3.3). In simple\\nterms, the theory states that organisms that are better suited for their environment will survive and reproduce,\\nwhile those that are poorly suited for their environment will die off. In our example, we can see that, as a\\ncarrier, Luwi’s mutation is highly adaptive in her African homeland; however, if she resided in the United\\nStates (where malaria is rare), her mutation could prove costly—with a high probability of the disease in her\\ndescendants and minor health problems of her own.\\nFIGURE 3.3 (a) In 1859, Charles Darwin proposed his theory of evolution by natural selection in his book, On the\\nOrigin of Species. (b) The book contains just one illustration: this diagram that shows how species evolve over time\\nthrough natural selection.\\nTwo Perspectives on Genetics and Behavior\\nIt’s easy to get confused about two fields that study the interaction of genes and the environment, such as the\\nfields of evolutionary psychology and behavioral genetics. How can we tell them apart?\\nIn both fields, it is understood that genes not only code for particular traits, but also contribute to certain\\npatterns of cognition and behavior. Evolutionary psychology focuses on how universal patterns of behavior and\\ncognitive processes have evolved over time. Therefore, variations in cognition and behavior would make\\nindividuals more or less successful in reproducing and passing those genes on to their offspring. Evolutionary\\npsychologists study a variety of psychological phenomena that may have evolved as adaptations, including fear\\nDIG DEEPER\\n3.1 • Human Genetics 73\\nresponse, food preferences, mate selection, and cooperative behaviors (Confer et al., 2010).\\nWhereas evolutionary psychologists focus on universal patterns that evolved over millions of years, behavioral\\ngeneticists study how individual differences arise, in the present, through the interaction of genes and the\\nenvironment. When studying human behavior, behavioral geneticists often employ twin and adoption studies to\\nresearch questions of interest. Twin studies compare the likelihood that a given behavioral trait is shared among\\nidentical and fraternal twins; adoption studies compare those rates among biologically related relatives and\\nadopted relatives. Both approaches provide some insight into the relative importance of genes and environment\\nfor the expression of a given trait.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nWatch this interview with renowned evolutionary psychologist David Buss (http://openstax.org/l/buss) to learn\\nmore about how a psychologist approaches evolution and how this approach fits within the social sciences.\\nGenetic Variation\\nGenetic variation, the genetic difference between individuals, is what contributes to a species’ adaptation to its\\nenvironment. In humans, genetic variation begins with an egg, about 100 million sperm, and fertilization.\\nRoughly once per month, active ovaries release an egg from follicles. During the egg\\'s journey from the ovary\\nthrough the fallopian tubes, to the uterus, a sperm may fertilize the egg.\\nThe egg and the sperm each contain 23 chromosomes. Chromosomes are long strings of genetic material\\nknown as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). DNA is a helix-shaped molecule made up of nucleotide base pairs. In\\neach chromosome, sequences of DNA make up genes that control or partially control a number of visible\\ncharacteristics, known as traits, such as eye color, hair color, and so on. A single gene may have multiple\\npossible variations, or alleles. An allele is a specific version of a gene. So, a given gene may code for the trait of\\nhair color, and the different alleles of that gene affect which hair color an individual has.\\nWhen a sperm and egg fuse, their 23 chromosomes combine to create a zygote with 46 chromosomes (23\\npairs). Therefore, each parent contributes half the genetic information carried by the offspring; the resulting\\nphysical characteristics of the offspring (called the phenotype) are determined by the interaction of genetic\\nmaterial supplied by the sperm and egg (called the genotype). A person’s genotype is the genetic makeup of\\nthat individual. Phenotype, on the other hand, refers to the individual’s inherited physical characteristics,\\nwhich are a combination of genetic and environmental influences (Figure 3.4).\\nFIGURE 3.4 (a) Genotype refers to the genetic makeup of an individual based on the genetic material (DNA)\\ninherited from one’s genetic contributors. (b) Phenotype describes an individual’s observable characteristics, such\\nas hair color, skin color, height, and build. (credit a: modification of work by Caroline Davis; credit b: modification of\\nwork by Cory Zanker)\\nNote that, in genetics and reproduction, \"parent\" is often used to describe the individual organisms that\\n74 3 • Biopsychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\ncontribute genetic material to offspring, usually in the form of gamete cells (sperm and egg). The concept of a\\ngenetic parent is distinct from social and legal concepts of parenthood, and may differ from those whom\\npeople consider their parents.\\nMost traits are controlled by multiple genes, but some traits are controlled by one gene. A characteristic like\\ncleft chin, for example, is influenced by a single gene from each parent. In this example, we will call the gene\\nfor cleft chin “B,” and the gene for smooth chin “b.” Cleft chin is a dominant trait, which means that having the\\ndominant allele either from one parent (Bb) or both parents (BB) will always result in the phenotype\\nassociated with the dominant allele. When someone has two copies of the same allele, they are said to be\\nhomozygous for that allele. When someone has a combination of alleles for a given gene, they are said to be\\nheterozygous. For example, smooth chin is a recessive trait, which means that an individual will only display\\nthe smooth chin phenotype if they are homozygous for that recessive allele (bb).\\nImagine that a person with a cleft chin mates with a person with a smooth chin. What type of chin will their\\noffspring have? The answer to that depends on which alleles each parent carries. If the person with a cleft is\\nhomozygous for cleft chin (BB), their offspring will always have cleft chin. It gets a little more complicated,\\nhowever, if the person is heterozygous for this gene (Bb). Since the other person has a smooth chin—therefore\\nhomozygous for the recessive allele (bb)—we can expect the offspring to have a 50% chance of having a cleft\\nchin and a 50% chance of having a smooth chin (Figure 3.5).\\nFIGURE 3.5 (a) A Punnett square is a tool used to predict how genes will interact in the production of offspring. The\\ncapital B represents the dominant allele, and the lowercase b represents the recessive allele. In the example of the\\ncleft chin, where B is cleft chin (dominant allele), wherever a pair contains the dominant allele, B, you can expect a\\ncleft chin phenotype. You can expect a smooth chin phenotype only when there are two copies of the recessive\\nallele, bb. (b) A cleft chin, shown here, is an inherited trait.\\nIn sickle cell anemia, heterozygous carriers (like Luwi from the example) can develop blood resistance to\\nmalaria infection while those who are homozygous (like Sena) have a potentially lethal blood disorder. Sickle-\\ncell anemia is just one of many genetic disorders caused by the pairing of two recessive genes. For example,\\nphenylketonuria (PKU) is a condition in which individuals lack an enzyme that normally converts harmful\\namino acids into harmless byproducts. If someone with this condition goes untreated, they will experience\\nsignificant deficits in cognitive function, seizures, and an increased risk of various psychiatric disorders.\\nBecause PKU is a recessive trait, each parent must have at least one copy of the recessive allele in order to\\nproduce a child with the condition (Figure 3.6).\\nSo far, we have discussed traits that involve just one gene, but few human characteristics are controlled by a\\nsingle gene. Most traits are polygenic: controlled by more than one gene. Height is one example of a polygenic\\ntrait, as are skin color and weight.\\n3.1 • Human Genetics 75\\nFIGURE 3.6 In this Punnett square, N represents the normal allele, and p represents the recessive allele that is\\nassociated with PKU. If two individuals mate who are both heterozygous for the allele associated with PKU, their\\noffspring have a 25% chance of expressing the PKU phenotype.\\nWhere do harmful genes that contribute to diseases like PKU come from? Gene mutations provide one source\\nof harmful genes. A mutation is a sudden, permanent change in a gene. While many mutations can be harmful\\nor lethal, once in a while, a mutation benefits an individual by giving that person an advantage over those who\\ndo not have the mutation. Recall that the theory of evolution asserts that individuals best adapted to their\\nparticular environments are more likely to reproduce and pass on their genes to future generations. In order\\nfor this process to occur, there must be competition—more technically, there must be variability in genes (and\\nresultant traits) that allow for variation in adaptability to the environment. If a population consisted of\\nidentical individuals, then any dramatic changes in the environment would affect everyone in the same way,\\nand there would be no variation in selection. In contrast, diversity in genes and associated traits allows some\\nindividuals to perform slightly better than others when faced with environmental change. This creates a\\ndistinct advantage for individuals best suited for their environments in terms of successful reproduction and\\ngenetic transmission.\\nHuman Diversity\\nThis chapter focuses on biology. Later in this course you will learn about social psychology and issues of race,\\nprejudice, and discrimination. When we focus strictly on biology, race becomes a weak construct. After the\\nsequencing of the human genome at the turn of the millennium, many scientists began to argue that race was not\\na useful variable in genetic research and that its continued use represents a potential source of confusion and\\nharm. The racial categories that some believed to be helpful in studying genetic diversity in humans are largely\\nirrelevant. A person\\'s skin tone, eye color, and hair texture are functions of their genetic makeups, but there is\\nactually more genetic variation within a given racial category than there is between racial categories. In some\\ncases, focus on race has led to difficulties with misdiagnoses and/or under-diagnoses of diseases ranging from\\nsickle cell anemia to cystic fibrosis. Some argue that we need to distinguish between ancestry and race and then\\nfocus on ancestry. This approach would facilitate greater understanding of human genetic diversity (Yudell,\\nRoberts, DeSalle, & Tishkoff, 2016).\\nDIG DEEPER\\n76 3 • Biopsychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nare healthier, are better able to cope, and are less depressed than people who have an external locus of control\\n(Benassi, Sweeney, & Durfour, 1988; Lefcourt, 1982; Maltby, Day, & Macaskill, 2007; Whyte, 1977, 1978, 1980).\\nFIGURE 11.11 Locus of control occurs on a continuum from internal to external.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nVisit this web page describing Locus of Control (http://openstax.org/l/locuscontrol) to learn more.\\nWalter Mischel and the Person-Situation Debate\\nWalter Mischel was a student of Julian Rotter and taught for years at Stanford, where he was a colleague of\\nAlbert Bandura. Mischel surveyed several decades of empirical psychological literature regarding trait\\nprediction of behavior, and his conclusion shook the foundations of personality psychology. Mischel found that\\nthe data did not support the central principle of the field—that a person’s personality traits are consistent\\nacross situations. His report triggered a decades-long period of self-examination, known as the person-\\nsituation debate, among personality psychologists.\\nMischel suggested that perhaps we were looking for consistency in the wrong places. He found that although\\nbehavior was inconsistent across different situations, it was much more consistent within situations—so that a\\nperson’s behavior in one situation would likely be repeated in a similar one. And as you will see next regarding\\nhis famous “marshmallow test,” Mischel also found that behavior is consistent in equivalent situations across\\ntime.\\nOne of Mischel’s most notable contributions to personality psychology was his ideas on self-regulation.\\nAccording to Lecci & Magnavita (2013), “Self-regulation is the process of identifying a goal or set of goals and,\\nin pursuing these goals, using both internal (e.g., thoughts and affect) and external (e.g., responses of anything\\nor anyone in the environment) feedback to maximize goal attainment” (p. 6.3). Self-regulation is also known as\\nwill power. When we talk about will power, we tend to think of it as the ability to delay gratification. For\\nexample, Bettina’s teenage son made strawberry cupcakes, and they looked delicious. However, Bettina\\nforfeited the pleasure of eating one, because she is training for a 5K race and wants to be fit and do well in the\\nrace. Would you be able to resist getting a small reward now in order to get a larger reward later? This is the\\nquestion Mischel investigated in his now-classic marshmallow test.\\nMischel designed a study to assess self-regulation in young children. In the marshmallow study, Mischel and\\nhis colleagues placed a preschool child in a room with one marshmallow on the table. The children were told\\nthey could either eat the marshmallow now, or wait until the researcher returned to the room, and then they\\ncould have two marshmallows (Mischel, Ebbesen & Raskoff, 1972). This was repeated with hundreds of\\npreschoolers. What Mischel and his team found was that young children differ in their degree of self-control.\\nMischel and his colleagues continued to follow this group of preschoolers through high school, and what do\\nyou think they discovered? The children who had more self-control in preschool (the ones who waited for the\\nbigger reward) were more successful in high school. They had higher SAT scores, had positive peer\\nrelationships, and were less likely to have substance abuse issues; as adults, they also had more stable\\nmarriages (Mischel, Shoda, & Rodriguez, 1989; Mischel et al., 2010). On the other hand, those children who had\\npoor self-control in preschool (the ones who grabbed the one marshmallow) were not as successful in high\\nschool, and they were found to have academic and behavioral problems. A more recent study using a larger\\nand more representative sample found associations between early delay of gratification (Watts, Duncan, &\\n376 11 • Personality\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nQuan, 2018) and measures of achievement in adolescence. However, researchers also found that the\\nassociations were not as strong as those reported during Mischel\\'s initial experiment and were quite sensitive\\nto situational factors such as early measures of cognitive capacity, family background, and home environment.\\nThis research suggests that consideration of situational factors is important to better understand behavior.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nWatch Joachim de Posada\\'s TEDTalk about the marshmallow test (http://openstax.org/l/TEDPosada) to learn\\nmore and to see the test given to children in Colombia.\\nToday, the debate is mostly resolved, and most psychologists consider both the situation and personal factors\\nin understanding behavior. For Mischel (1993), people are situation processors. The children in the\\nmarshmallow test each processed, or interpreted, the rewards structure of that situation in their own way.\\nMischel’s approach to personality stresses the importance of both the situation and the way the person\\nperceives the situation. Instead of behavior being determined by the situation, people use cognitive processes\\nto interpret the situation and then behave in accordance with that interpretation.\\n11.5 Humanistic Approaches\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Discuss the contributions of Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers to personality development\\nAs the “third force” in psychology, humanism is touted as a reaction both to the pessimistic determinism of\\npsychoanalysis, with its emphasis on psychological disturbance, and to the behaviorists’ view of humans\\npassively reacting to the environment, which has been criticized as making people out to be personality-less\\nrobots. It does not suggest that psychoanalytic, behaviorist, and other points of view are incorrect but argues\\nthat these perspectives do not recognize the depth and meaning of human experience, and fail to recognize the\\ninnate capacity for self-directed change and transforming personal experiences. This perspective focuses on\\nhow healthy people develop. One pioneering humanist, Abraham Maslow, studied people who he considered to\\nbe healthy, creative, and productive, including Albert Einstein, Eleanor Roosevelt, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham\\nLincoln, and others. Maslow (1950, 1970) found that such people share similar characteristics, such as being\\nopen, creative, loving, spontaneous, compassionate, concerned for others, and accepting of themselves. When\\nyou studied motivation, you learned about one of the best-known humanistic theories, Maslow\\'s hierarchy of\\nneeds theory, in which Maslow proposes that human beings have certain needs in common and that these\\nneeds must be met in a certain order. The highest need is the need for self-actualization, which is the\\nachievement of our fullest potential. Maslow differentiated between needs that motivate us to fulfill something\\nthat is missing and needs that inspire us to grow. He believed that many emotional and behavioral concerns\\narise as a result of failing to meet these hierarchical needs.\\nAnother humanistic theorist was Carl Rogers. One of Rogers’s main ideas about personality regards self-\\nconcept, our thoughts and feelings about ourselves. How would you respond to the question, “Who am I?” Your\\nanswer can show how you see yourself. If your response is primarily positive, then you tend to feel good about\\nwho you are, and you see the world as a safe and positive place. If your response is mainly negative, then you\\nmay feel unhappy with who you are. Rogers further divided the self into two categories: the ideal self and the\\nreal self. The ideal self is the person that you would like to be; the real self is the person you actually are.\\nRogers focused on the idea that we need to achieve consistency between these two selves. We experience\\ncongruence when our thoughts about our real self and ideal self are very similar—in other words, when our\\nself-concept is accurate. High congruence leads to a greater sense of self-worth and a healthy, productive life.\\nParents can help their children achieve this by giving them unconditional positive regard, or unconditional\\nlove. According to Rogers (1980), “As persons are accepted and prized, they tend to develop a more caring\\nattitude towards themselves” (p. 116). Conversely, when there is a great discrepancy between our ideal and\\n11.5 • Humanistic Approaches 377\\nactual selves, we experience a state Rogers called incongruence, which can lead to maladjustment. Both\\nRogers’s and Maslow’s theories focus on individual choices and do not believe that biology is deterministic.\\n11.6 Biological Approaches\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Discuss the findings of the Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart as they relate to personality and genetics\\n• Discuss temperament and describe the three infant temperaments identified by Thomas and Chess\\n• Discuss the evolutionary perspective on personality development\\nHow much of our personality is in-born and biological, and how much is influenced by the environment and\\nculture we are raised in? Psychologists who favor the biological approach believe that inherited\\npredispositions as well as physiological processes can be used to explain differences in our personalities\\n(Burger, 2008).\\nEvolutionary psychology relative to personality development looks at personality traits that are universal, as\\nwell as differences across individuals. In this view, adaptive differences have evolved and then provide a\\nsurvival and reproductive advantage. Individual differences are important from an evolutionary viewpoint for\\nseveral reasons. Certain individual differences, and the heritability of these characteristics, have been well\\ndocumented. David Buss has identified several theories to explore this relationship between personality traits\\nand evolution, such as life-history theory, which looks at how people expend their time and energy (such as on\\nbodily growth and maintenance, reproduction, or parenting). Another example is costly signaling theory,\\nwhich examines the honesty and deception in the signals people send one another about their quality as a\\nmate or friend (Buss, 2009).\\nIn the field of behavioral genetics, the Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart—a well-known study of the\\ngenetic basis for personality—conducted research with twins from 1979 to 1999. In studying 350 pairs of\\ntwins, including pairs of identical and fraternal twins reared together and apart, researchers found that\\nidentical twins, whether raised together or apart, have very similar personalities (Bouchard, 1994; Bouchard,\\nLykken, McGue, Segal, & Tellegen, 1990; Segal, 2012). These findings suggest the heritability of some\\npersonality traits. Heritability refers to the proportion of difference among people that is attributed to\\ngenetics. Some of the traits that the study reported as having more than a 0.50 heritability ratio include\\nleadership, obedience to authority, a sense of well-being, alienation, resistance to stress, and fearfulness. The\\nimplication is that some aspects of our personalities are largely controlled by genetics; however, it’s important\\nto point out that traits are not determined by a single gene, but by a combination of many genes, as well as by\\nepigenetic factors that control whether the genes are expressed.\\nOther research that has examined the link between personality and other factors has identified and studied\\nType A and Type B personalities, which you will learn more about in the chapter on Stress, Health, and\\nLifestyle.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nWatch this video about genetic makeup\\'s influence on personality (http://openstax.org/l/persondna) to learn\\nmore.\\nTemperament\\nMost contemporary psychologists believe temperament has a biological basis due to its appearance very early\\nin our lives (Rothbart, 2011). As you learned when you studied lifespan development, Thomas and Chess\\n(1977) found that babies could be categorized into one of three temperaments: easy, difficult, or slow to warm\\nup. However, environmental factors (family interactions, for example) and maturation can affect the ways in\\nwhich children’s personalities are expressed (Carter et al., 2008).\\n378 11 • Personality\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nResearch suggests that there are two dimensions of our temperament that are important parts of our adult\\npersonality—reactivity and self-regulation (Rothbart, Ahadi, & Evans, 2000). Reactivity refers to how we\\nrespond to new or challenging environmental stimuli; self-regulation refers to our ability to control that\\nresponse (Rothbart & Derryberry, 1981; Rothbart, Sheese, Rueda, & Posner, 2011). For example, one person\\nmay immediately respond to new stimuli with a high level of anxiety, while another barely notices it.\\n11.7 Trait Theorists\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Discuss early trait theories of Cattell and Eysenck\\n• Discuss the Big Five factors and describe someone who is high and low on each of the five factors\\nTrait theorists believe personality can be understood via the approach that all people have certain traits, or\\ncharacteristic ways of behaving. Do you tend to be sociable or shy? Passive or aggressive? Optimistic or\\npessimistic? Moody or even-tempered? Early trait theorists tried to describe all human personality traits. For\\nexample, one trait theorist, Gordon Allport (Allport & Odbert, 1936), found 4,500 words in the English language\\nthat could describe people. He organized these personality traits into three categories: cardinal traits, central\\ntraits, and secondary traits. A cardinal trait is one that dominates your entire personality, and hence your\\nlife—such as Ebenezer Scrooge’s greed and Mother Theresa’s altruism. Cardinal traits are not very common:\\nFew people have personalities dominated by a single trait. Instead, our personalities typically are composed of\\nmultiple traits. Central traits are those that make up our personalities (such as loyal, kind, agreeable, friendly,\\nsneaky, wild, and grouchy). Secondary traits are those that are not quite as obvious or as consistent as central\\ntraits. They are present under specific circumstances and include preferences and attitudes. For example, one\\nperson gets angry when people try to tickle him; another can only sleep on the left side of the bed; and yet\\nanother always orders her salad dressing on the side. And you—although not normally an anxious person—feel\\nnervous before making a speech in front of your English class.\\nIn an effort to make the list of traits more manageable, Raymond Cattell (1946, 1957) narrowed down the list to\\nabout 171 traits. However, saying that a trait is either present or absent does not accurately reflect a person’s\\nuniqueness, because all of our personalities are actually made up of the same traits; we differ only in the\\ndegree to which each trait is expressed. Cattell (1957) identified 16 factors or dimensions of personality:\\nwarmth, reasoning, emotional stability, dominance, liveliness, rule-consciousness, social boldness, sensitivity,\\nvigilance, abstractedness, privateness, apprehension, openness to change, self-reliance, perfectionism, and\\ntension (Table 11.5). He developed a personality assessment based on these 16 factors, called the 16PF.\\nInstead of a trait being present or absent, each dimension is scored over a continuum, from high to low. For\\nexample, your level of warmth describes how warm, caring, and nice to others you are. If you score low on this\\nindex, you tend to be more distant and cold. A high score on this index signifies you are supportive and\\ncomforting.\\nPersonality Factors Measured by the 16PF Questionnaire\\nFactor Low Score High Score\\nWarmth Reserved, detached Outgoing, supportive\\nIntellect Concrete thinker Analytical\\nEmotional stability Moody, irritable Stable, calm\\nAggressiveness Docile, submissive Controlling, dominant\\nTABLE 11.5\\n11.7 • Trait Theorists 379\\nFactor Low Score High Score\\nLiveliness Somber, prudent Adventurous, spontaneous\\nDutifulness Unreliable Conscientious\\nSocial assertiveness Shy, restrained Uninhibited, bold\\nSensitivity Tough-minded Sensitive, caring\\nParanoia Trusting Suspicious\\nAbstractness Conventional Imaginative\\nIntroversion Open, straightforward Private, shrewd\\nAnxiety Confident Apprehensive\\nOpenmindedness Closeminded, traditional Curious, experimental\\nIndependence Outgoing, social Self-sufficient\\nPerfectionism Disorganized, casual Organized, precise\\nTension Relaxed Stressed\\nTABLE 11.5\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nTake this assessment based on Cattell\\'s 16PF questionnaire (http://openstax.org/l/cattell) to see which\\npersonality traits dominate your personality.\\nPsychologists Hans and Sybil Eysenck were personality theorists (Figure 11.12) who focused on temperament,\\nthe inborn, genetically based personality differences that you studied earlier in the chapter.

Board of Education civil rights case (http://openstax.org/l/crogers2) to learn more. The American Psychological Association has several ethnically based organizations for professional psychologists that facilitate interactions among members. Since psychologists belonging to specific ethnic groups or cultures have the most interest in studying the psychology of their communities, these organizations provide an opportunity for the growth of research on the interplay between culture and psychology. WOMEN IN PSYCHOLOGY Although rarely given credit, women have been contributing to psychology since its inception as a field of study. In 1894, Margaret Floy Washburn was the first woman awarded the doctoral degree in psychology. She wrote The Animal Mind: A Textbook of Comparative Psychology, and it was the standard in the field for over 20 years. In the mid 1890s, Mary Whiton Calkins completed all requirements toward the PhD in psychology, but Harvard University refused to award her that degree because she was a woman. She had been taught and mentored by William James, who tried and failed to convince Harvard to award her the doctoral degree. Her memory research studied primacy and recency (Madigan & O’Hara, 1992), and she also wrote about how structuralism and functionalism both explained self-psychology (Calkins, 1906). Another influential woman, Mary Cover Jones, conducted a study she considered to be a sequel to John B. Watson’s study of Little Albert (you’ll learn about this study in the chapter on Learning). Jones unconditioned fear in Little Peter, who had been afraid of rabbits (Jones, 1924). Ethnic minority women contributing to the field of psychology include Martha Bernal and Inez Beverly Prosser; their studies were related to education. Bernal, the first Latina to earn her doctoral degree in psychology (1962) conducted much of her research with Mexican American children. Prosser was the first African American woman awarded the PhD in 1933 at the University of Cincinnati (Benjamin et al.). Women have also contributed to psychological research in other areas, such as the development of the psychoanalytic school of thought, which was founded by Sigmund Freud. Freud’s work was heavily influenced by the work of Wilhelm Wundt, a German physiologist who conducted the world’s first psychological experiments in Leipzig, Germany. The first women to receive a Ph.D. in psychoanalysis were Anna Freud and Ingrid Bergman (Freud & Bergmann). In addition to these women, there are a number of other women who have made significant contributions to the psychology field. For example, Elizabeth Loftus is an expert witness in criminal cases and has been involved in several high-profile cases, including the 9/11 attacks and the Columbine high school shootings. She is also the author of several books on memory and memory research, as well as her own popular book, Memory: The Science of Remembering (Loftus). She has received numerous awards for her contributions to the science of memory (e.g., National Medal of Science, National Academy of Sciences, American Psychological Association, Association for Psychological Science). In addition, she is a professor at Stanford University, where she has taught psychology for more than 40 years. Women in Psychology: An Ethnographic Perspective In this chapter, we will explore the contributions of women psychologists to our understanding of human behaviors and mental processes. We will also examine the ways in which these contributions have influenced the way that psychology is practiced today. We will begin with a brief overview of how psychology has evolved over the past two centuries. This will help us to understand the role that women played in this evolution and how their contributions are relevant to today’s research and practice. Psychology has gone through many changes throughout its history. Initially, psychology was primarily concerned with understanding the mind and behavior of humans. However, over time, it has become increasingly focused on studying animals and other non-human organisms. As a result, psychologists have had to adapt their research methods and theories in order to study these different types of organisms. This adaptation has resulted in a greater diversity of perspectives and approaches to understanding human and animal behavior. In the nineteenth century, many psychologists were influenced by the ideas of John Stuart Mill. Mill argued that humans are rational beings who can reason and make decisions based on reason. He believed that humans have a\", 'references': '{\"sections\": [\"Introduction to Psychology\", \"Personality/Personality Assessment\", \"Biopsychology/The Brain and Spinal Cord\"], \"pages\": [\"32\", \"390\", \"86\"]}'}\n",

The chapter will close with\\na discussion of a historically important theory of perception called Gestalt.\\n5Sensation and Perception\\n5.1 Sensation versus Perception\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Distinguish between sensation and perception\\n• Describe the concepts of absolute threshold and difference threshold\\n• Discuss the roles attention, motivation, and sensory adaptation play in perception\\nSensation\\nWhat does it mean to sense something? Sensory receptors are specialized neurons that respond to specific\\ntypes of stimuli. When sensory information is detected by a sensory receptor, sensation has occurred. For\\nexample, light that enters the eye causes chemical changes in cells that line the back of the eye. These cells\\nrelay messages, in the form of action potentials (as you learned when studying biopsychology), to the central\\nnervous system. The conversion from sensory stimulus energy to action potential is known as transduction.\\nYou have probably known since elementary school that we have five senses: vision, hearing (audition), smell\\n(olfaction), taste (gustation), and touch (somatosensation). It turns out that this notion of five senses is\\noversimplified. We also have sensory systems that provide information about balance (the vestibular sense),\\nbody position and movement (proprioception and kinesthesia), pain (nociception), and temperature\\n(thermoception).\\nThe sensitivity of a given sensory system to the relevant stimuli can be expressed as an absolute threshold.\\nAbsolute threshold refers to the minimum amount of stimulus energy that must be present for the stimulus to\\nbe detected 50% of the time. Another way to think about this is by asking how dim can a light be or how soft\\ncan a sound be and still be detected half of the time. The sensitivity of our sensory receptors can be quite\\namazing. It has been estimated that on a clear night, the most sensitive sensory cells in the back of the eye can\\ndetect a candle flame 30 miles away (Okawa & Sampath, 2007). Under quiet conditions, the hair cells (the\\nreceptor cells of the inner ear) can detect the tick of a clock 20 feet away (Galanter, 1962).\\nIt is also possible for us to get messages that are presented below the threshold for conscious awareness—these\\nare called subliminal messages. A stimulus reaches a physiological threshold when it is strong enough to\\nexcite sensory receptors and send nerve impulses to the brain: This is an absolute threshold. A message below\\nthat threshold is said to be subliminal: We receive it, but we are not consciously aware of it. Over the years\\nthere has been a great deal of speculation about the use of subliminal messages in advertising, rock music, and\\nself-help audio programs. Research evidence shows that in laboratory settings, people can process and\\nrespond to information outside of awareness. But this does not mean that we obey these messages like\\nzombies; in fact, hidden messages have little effect on behavior outside the laboratory (Kunst-Wilson & Zajonc,\\n1980; Rensink, 2004; Nelson, 2008; Radel, Sarrazin, Legrain, & Gobancé, 2009; Loersch, Durso, & Petty, 2013).\\nAbsolute thresholds are generally measured under incredibly controlled conditions in situations that are\\noptimal for sensitivity. Sometimes, we are more interested in how much difference in stimuli is required to\\ndetect a difference between them. This is known as the just noticeable difference (jnd) or difference\\nthreshold. Unlike the absolute threshold, the difference threshold changes depending on the stimulus\\nintensity. As an example, imagine yourself in a very dark movie theater. If an audience member were to receive\\na text message that caused the cell phone screen to light up, chances are that many people would notice the\\nchange in illumination in the theater. However, if the same thing happened in a brightly lit arena during a\\nbasketball game, very few people would notice. The cell phone brightness does not change, but its ability to be\\ndetected as a change in illumination varies dramatically between the two contexts. Ernst Weber proposed this\\ntheory of change in difference threshold in the 1830s, and it has become known as Weber’s law: The difference\\nthreshold is a constant fraction of the original stimulus, as the example illustrates.\\n146 5 • Sensation and Perception\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nPerception\\nWhile our sensory receptors are constantly collecting information from the environment, it is ultimately how\\nwe interpret that information that affects how we interact with the world. Perception refers to the way sensory\\ninformation is organized, interpreted, and consciously experienced. Perception involves both bottom-up and\\ntop-down processing. Bottom-up processing refers to sensory information from a stimulus in the\\nenvironment driving a process, and top-down processing refers to knowledge and expectancy driving a\\nprocess, as shown in Figure 5.2 (Egeth & Yantis, 1997; Fine & Minnery, 2009; Yantis & Egeth, 1999).\\nFIGURE 5.2 Top-down and bottom-up are ways we process our perceptions.\\nImagine that you and some friends are sitting in a crowded restaurant eating lunch and talking. It is very noisy,\\nand you are concentrating on your friend’s face to hear what they are saying, then the sound of breaking glass\\nand clang of metal pans hitting the floor rings out. The server dropped a large tray of food. Although you were\\nattending to your meal and conversation, that crashing sound would likely get through your attentional filters\\nand capture your attention. You would have no choice but to notice it. That attentional capture would be caused\\nby the sound from the environment: it would be bottom-up.\\nAlternatively, top-down processes are generally goal directed, slow, deliberate, effortful, and under your\\ncontrol (Fine & Minnery, 2009; Miller & Cohen, 2001; Miller & D'Esposito, 2005). For instance, if you misplaced\\nyour keys, how would you look for them? If you had a yellow key fob, you would probably look for yellowness of\\na certain size in specific locations, such as on the counter, coffee table, and other similar places. You would not\\nlook for yellowness on your ceiling fan, because you know keys are not normally lying on top of a ceiling fan.\\nThat act of searching for a certain size of yellowness in some locations and not others would be top-\\ndown—under your control and based on your experience.\\nOne way to think of this concept is that sensation is a physical process, whereas perception is psychological.\\nFor example, upon walking into a kitchen and smelling the scent of baking cinnamon rolls, the sensation is the\\nscent receptors detecting the odor of cinnamon, but the perception may be “Mmm, this smells like the bread\\nGrandma used to bake when the family gathered for holidays.”\\nAlthough our perceptions are built from sensations, not all sensations result in perception. In fact, we often\\ndon’t perceive stimuli that remain relatively constant over prolonged periods of time. This is known as\\nsensory adaptation. Imagine going to a city that you have never visited. You check in to the hotel, but when\\nyou get to your room, there is a road construction sign with a bright flashing light outside your window.\\nUnfortunately, there are no other rooms available, so you are stuck with a flashing light. You decide to watch\\ntelevision to unwind. The flashing light was extremely annoying when you first entered your room. It was as if\\nsomeone was continually turning a bright yellow spotlight on and off in your room, but after watching\\ntelevision for a short while, you no longer notice the light flashing. The light is still flashing and filling your\\nroom with yellow light every few seconds, and the photoreceptors in your eyes still sense the light, but you no\\nlonger perceive the rapid changes in lighting conditions. That you no longer perceive the flashing light\\ndemonstrates sensory adaptation and shows that while closely associated, sensation and perception are\\ndifferent.\\n5.1 • Sensation versus Perception 147\\nThere is another factor that affects sensation and perception: attention. Attention plays a significant role in\\ndetermining what is sensed versus what is perceived. Imagine you are at a party full of music, chatter, and\\nlaughter. You get involved in an interesting conversation with a friend, and you tune out all the background\\nnoise. If someone interrupted you to ask what song had just finished playing, you would probably be unable to\\nanswer that question.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nSee for yourself how inattentional blindness works by checking out this selective attention test\\n(http://openstax.org/l/blindness) from Simons and Chabris (1999).\\nOne of the most interesting demonstrations of how important attention is in determining our perception of the\\nenvironment occurred in a famous study conducted by Daniel Simons and Christopher Chabris (1999). In this\\nstudy, participants watched a video of people dressed in black and white passing basketballs. Participants\\nwere asked to count the number of times the team dressed in white passed the ball. During the video, a person\\ndressed in a black gorilla costume walks among the two teams. You would think that someone would notice the\\ngorilla, right? Nearly half of the people who watched the video didn’t notice the gorilla at all, despite the fact\\nthat he was clearly visible for nine seconds. Because participants were so focused on the number of times the\\nteam dressed in white was passing the ball, they completely tuned out other visual information. Inattentional\\nblindness is the failure to notice something that is completely visible because the person was actively\\nattending to something else and did not pay attention to other things (Mack & Rock, 1998; Simons & Chabris,\\n1999).\\nIn a similar experiment, researchers tested inattentional blindness by asking participants to observe images\\nmoving across a computer screen. They were instructed to focus on either white or black objects, disregarding\\nthe other color. When a red cross passed across the screen, about one third of subjects did not notice it (Figure\\n5.3) (Most, Simons, Scholl, & Chabris, 2000).\\nFIGURE 5.3 Nearly one third of participants in a study did not notice that a red cross passed on the screen because\\ntheir attention was focused on the black or white figures. (credit: Cory Zanker)\\nMotivation can also affect perception. Have you ever been expecting a really important phone call and, while\\ntaking a shower, you think you hear the phone ringing, only to discover that it is not? If so, then you have\\nexperienced how motivation to detect a meaningful stimulus can shift our ability to discriminate between a\\ntrue sensory stimulus and background noise. The ability to identify a stimulus when it is embedded in a\\ndistracting background is called signal detection theory. This might also explain why a mother is awakened\\nby a quiet murmur from her baby but not by other sounds that occur while she is asleep. Signal detection\\ntheory has practical applications, such as increasing air traffic controller accuracy. Controllers need to be able\\nto detect planes among many signals (blips) that appear on the radar screen and follow those planes as they\\nmove through the sky. In fact, the original work of the researcher who developed signal detection theory was\\nfocused on improving the sensitivity of air traffic controllers to plane blips (Swets, 1964).\\n148 5 • Sensation and Perception\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nOur perceptions can also be affected by our beliefs, values, prejudices, expectations, and life experiences. As\\nyou will see later in this chapter, individuals who are deprived of the experience of binocular vision during\\ncritical periods of development have trouble perceiving depth (Fawcett, Wang, & Birch, 2005). The shared\\nexperiences of people within a given cultural context can have pronounced effects on perception. For example,\\nMarshall Segall, Donald Campbell, and Melville Herskovits (1963) published the results of a multinational\\nstudy in which they demonstrated that individuals from Western cultures were more prone to experience\\ncertain types of visual illusions than individuals from non-Western cultures, and vice versa. One such illusion\\nthat Westerners were more likely to experience was the Müller-Lyer illusion (Figure 5.4): The lines appear to be\\ndifferent lengths, but they are actually the same length.\\nFIGURE 5.4 In the Müller-Lyer illusion, lines appear to be different lengths although they are identical. (a) Arrows at\\nthe ends of lines may make the line on the right appear longer, although the lines are the same length. (b) When\\napplied to a three-dimensional image, the line on the right again may appear longer although both black lines are\\nthe same length.\\nThese perceptual differences were consistent with differences in the types of environmental features\\nexperienced on a regular basis by people in a given cultural context. People in Western cultures, for example,\\nhave a perceptual context of buildings with straight lines, what Segall’s study called a carpentered world (Segall\\net al., 1966). In contrast, people from certain non-Western cultures with an uncarpentered view, such as the\\nZulu of South Africa, whose villages are made up of round huts arranged in circles, are less susceptible to this\\nillusion (Segall et al., 1999). It is not just vision that is affected by cultural factors. Indeed, research has\\ndemonstrated that the ability to identify an odor, and rate its pleasantness and its intensity, varies cross-\\nculturally (Ayabe-Kanamura, Saito, Distel, Martínez-Gómez, & Hudson, 1998).\\nChildren described as thrill seekers are more likely to show taste preferences for intense sour flavors (Liem,\\nWesterbeek, Wolterink, Kok, & de Graaf, 2004), which suggests that basic aspects of personality might affect\\nperception. Furthermore, individuals who hold positive attitudes toward reduced-fat foods are more likely to\\nrate foods labeled as reduced fat as tasting better than people who have less positive attitudes about these\\nproducts (Aaron, Mela, & Evans, 1994).\\n5.2 Waves and Wavelengths\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Describe important physical features of wave forms\\n• Show how physical properties of light waves are associated with perceptual experience\\n• Show how physical properties of sound waves are associated with perceptual experience\\nVisual and auditory stimuli both occur in the form of waves. Although the two stimuli are very different in\\nterms of composition, wave forms share similar characteristics that are especially important to our visual and\\n5.2 • Waves and Wavelengths 149\\nauditory perceptions. In this section, we describe the physical properties of the waves as well as the perceptual\\nexperiences associated with them.\\nAmplitude and Wavelength\\nTwo physical characteristics of a wave are amplitude and wavelength (Figure 5.5). The amplitude of a wave is\\nthe distance from the center line to the top point of the crest or the bottom point of the trough. Wavelength\\nrefers to the length of a wave from one peak to the next.\\nFIGURE 5.5 The amplitude or height of a wave is measured from the peak to the trough. The wavelength is\\nmeasured from peak to peak.\\nWavelength is directly related to the frequency of a given wave form. Frequency refers to the number of waves\\nthat pass a given point in a given time period and is often expressed in terms of hertz (Hz), or cycles per\\nsecond. Longer wavelengths will have lower frequencies, and shorter wavelengths will have higher frequencies\\n(Figure 5.6).\\nFIGURE 5.6 This figure illustrates waves of differing wavelengths/frequencies. At the top of the figure, the red wave\\nhas a long wavelength/short frequency. Moving from top to bottom, the wavelengths decrease and frequencies\\nincrease.\\nLight Waves\\nThe visible spectrum is the portion of the larger electromagnetic spectrum that we can see. As Figure 5.7\\nshows, the electromagnetic spectrum encompasses all of the electromagnetic radiation that occurs in our\\nenvironment and includes gamma rays, x-rays, ultraviolet light, visible light, infrared light, microwaves, and\\nradio waves. The visible spectrum in humans is associated with wavelengths that range from 380 to 740 nm—a\\nvery small distance, since a nanometer (nm) is one billionth of a meter. Other species can detect other portions\\nof the electromagnetic spectrum. For instance, honeybees can see light in the ultraviolet range (Wakakuwa,\\nStavenga, & Arikawa, 2007), and some snakes can detect infrared radiation in addition to more traditional\\nvisual light cues (Chen, Deng, Brauth, Ding, & Tang, 2012; Hartline, Kass, & Loop, 1978).\\n150 5 • Sensation and Perception\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\n\", 'answer': 'Answer VERY concisely from the provided context only.

We rely on our sensory systems to provide important information about our surroundings. We use this information to successfully navigate and interact with our environment so that we can find nourishment, seek shelter, maintain social relationships, and avoid potentially dangerous situations. This chapter will provide an overview of how sensory information is received and processed by the nervous system and how that affects our conscious experience of the world. We begin by learning the distinction between sensation and perception. Next, we explore the properties of light and sound waves, as well as how they are perceived by our eyes and ears, respectively. The chapter then turns to the study of vision, hearing, and the other senses, including touch and smell. Finally, the chapter discusses the principles of perception and how they can be applied to our everyday lives. Sensory Systems The nervous system is a complex network of nerve cells (neurons) that transmit and receive information from the outside world, such as light, sound, touch, smell, taste, sight, etc. These neurons are organized into different types of neurons, each with its own specific function. For example, there are sensory neurons that receive information from our sense organs (eyes, ears) and transmit that information to other parts of our nervous system. There are also motor neurons (nerve cells that send signals to muscles to cause them to contract or relax), which are responsible for controlling the movement of muscles in response to signals received from other neurons. The sensory system receives and processes information in a variety of ways, depending on the type of input that is being received. Sensory information can come in many different forms. Some of these forms include visual, auditory, olfactory (smell), gustatory (taste), tactile (touch), and proprioceptive (body position and movement) information. Each sensory type has a unique way of processing and interpreting the information it receives, which is referred to as its “type of sensation”. Types of Sensations There are two main categories of sensations: physical sensations and emotional sensations. Physical sensations are those that involve the body’s internal organs and systems. Examples of physical sensory types include pain, temperature, pressure, vibration, cold, heat, humidity, moisture, motion, gravity, vision, sight, audition (hearing), olfaction (嗅觉), taste (salty, sweet, sour, bitter, umami), touch (warm, cool, rough, smooth), and proprioception (position, movement, balance). Emotional sensations refer to feelings and emotions that arise from interactions with the external world. Examples of emotional types include fear, anxiety, anger, sadness, happiness, joy, surprise, excitement, disgust, disgust, shame, guilt, embarrassment, pride, contempt, fear of death, love, hate, jealousy, envy, sympathy, compassion, gratitude, awe, wonder, curiosity,', 'references': '{\"sections\": [\"Sensation and Perception/Vision\"], \"pages\": [\"158\", \"159\", \"160\"]}'}\n",

Inattentional\\nblindness is the failure to notice something that is completely visible because the person was actively\\nattending to something else and did not pay attention to other things (Mack & Rock, 1998; Simons & Chabris,\\n1999).\\nIn a similar experiment, researchers tested inattentional blindness by asking participants to observe images\\nmoving across a computer screen. They were instructed to focus on either white or black objects, disregarding\\nthe other color. When a red cross passed across the screen, about one third of subjects did not notice it (Figure\\n5.3) (Most, Simons, Scholl, & Chabris, 2000).\\nFIGURE 5.3 Nearly one third of participants in a study did not notice that a red cross passed on the screen because\\ntheir attention was focused on the black or white figures. (credit: Cory Zanker)\\nMotivation can also affect perception. Have you ever been expecting a really important phone call and, while\\ntaking a shower, you think you hear the phone ringing, only to discover that it is not? If so, then you have\\nexperienced how motivation to detect a meaningful stimulus can shift our ability to discriminate between a\\ntrue sensory stimulus and background noise. The ability to identify a stimulus when it is embedded in a\\ndistracting background is called signal detection theory. This might also explain why a mother is awakened\\nby a quiet murmur from her baby but not by other sounds that occur while she is asleep. Signal detection\\ntheory has practical applications, such as increasing air traffic controller accuracy. Controllers need to be able\\nto detect planes among many signals (blips) that appear on the radar screen and follow those planes as they\\nmove through the sky. In fact, the original work of the researcher who developed signal detection theory was\\nfocused on improving the sensitivity of air traffic controllers to plane blips (Swets, 1964).\\n148 5 • Sensation and Perception\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nOur perceptions can also be affected by our beliefs, values, prejudices, expectations, and life experiences. As\\nyou will see later in this chapter, individuals who are deprived of the experience of binocular vision during\\ncritical periods of development have trouble perceiving depth (Fawcett, Wang, & Birch, 2005). The shared\\nexperiences of people within a given cultural context can have pronounced effects on perception. For example,\\nMarshall Segall, Donald Campbell, and Melville Herskovits (1963) published the results of a multinational\\nstudy in which they demonstrated that individuals from Western cultures were more prone to experience\\ncertain types of visual illusions than individuals from non-Western cultures, and vice versa. One such illusion\\nthat Westerners were more likely to experience was the Müller-Lyer illusion (Figure 5.4): The lines appear to be\\ndifferent lengths, but they are actually the same length.\\nFIGURE 5.4 In the Müller-Lyer illusion, lines appear to be different lengths although they are identical. (a) Arrows at\\nthe ends of lines may make the line on the right appear longer, although the lines are the same length. (b) When\\napplied to a three-dimensional image, the line on the right again may appear longer although both black lines are\\nthe same length.\\nThese perceptual differences were consistent with differences in the types of environmental features\\nexperienced on a regular basis by people in a given cultural context. People in Western cultures, for example,\\nhave a perceptual context of buildings with straight lines, what Segall’s study called a carpentered world (Segall\\net al., 1966). In contrast, people from certain non-Western cultures with an uncarpentered view, such as the\\nZulu of South Africa, whose villages are made up of round huts arranged in circles, are less susceptible to this\\nillusion (Segall et al., 1999). It is not just vision that is affected by cultural factors. Indeed, research has\\ndemonstrated that the ability to identify an odor, and rate its pleasantness and its intensity, varies cross-\\nculturally (Ayabe-Kanamura, Saito, Distel, Martínez-Gómez, & Hudson, 1998).\\nChildren described as thrill seekers are more likely to show taste preferences for intense sour flavors (Liem,\\nWesterbeek, Wolterink, Kok, & de Graaf, 2004), which suggests that basic aspects of personality might affect\\nperception. Furthermore, individuals who hold positive attitudes toward reduced-fat foods are more likely to\\nrate foods labeled as reduced fat as tasting better than people who have less positive attitudes about these\\nproducts (Aaron, Mela, & Evans, 1994).\\n5.2 Waves and Wavelengths\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Describe important physical features of wave forms\\n• Show how physical properties of light waves are associated with perceptual experience\\n• Show how physical properties of sound waves are associated with perceptual experience\\nVisual and auditory stimuli both occur in the form of waves.

Perception involves the organization,\\ninterpretation, and conscious experience of those sensations. All sensory systems have both absolute and\\ndifference thresholds, which refer to the minimum amount of stimulus energy or the minimum amount of\\ndifference in stimulus energy required to be detected about 50% of the time, respectively. Sensory adaptation,\\nselective attention, and signal detection theory can help explain what is perceived and what is not. In addition,\\nour perceptions are affected by a number of factors, including beliefs, values, prejudices, culture, and life\\nexperiences.\\n5.2 Waves and Wavelengths\\nBoth light and sound can be described in terms of wave forms with physical characteristics like amplitude,\\nwavelength, and timbre. Wavelength and frequency are inversely related so that longer waves have lower\\nfrequencies, and shorter waves have higher frequencies. In the visual system, a light wave’s wavelength is\\ngenerally associated with color, and its amplitude is associated with brightness. In the auditory system, a\\nsound’s frequency is associated with pitch, and its amplitude is associated with loudness.\\n5.3 Vision\\nLight waves cross the cornea and enter the eye at the pupil. The eye’s lens focuses this light so that the image is\\nfocused on a region of the retina known as the fovea. The fovea contains cones that possess high levels of\\nvisual acuity and operate best in bright light conditions. Rods are located throughout the retina and operate\\nbest under dim light conditions. Visual information leaves the eye via the optic nerve. Information from each\\nvisual field is sent to the opposite side of the brain at the optic chiasm. Visual information then moves through\\na number of brain sites before reaching the occipital lobe, where it is processed.\\nTwo theories explain color perception. The trichromatic theory asserts that three distinct cone groups are\\ntuned to slightly different wavelengths of light, and it is the combination of activity across these cone types that\\nresults in our perception of all the colors we see. The opponent-process theory of color vision asserts that color\\nis processed in opponent pairs and accounts for the interesting phenomenon of a negative afterimage. We\\nperceive depth through a combination of monocular and binocular depth cues.\\n5.4 Hearing\\nSound waves are funneled into the auditory canal and cause vibrations of the eardrum; these vibrations move\\nthe ossicles. As the ossicles move, the stapes presses against the oval window of the cochlea, which causes fluid\\ninside the cochlea to move. As a result, hair cells embedded in the basilar membrane become enlarged, which\\nsends neural impulses to the brain via the auditory nerve.\\nPitch perception and sound localization are important aspects of hearing. Our ability to perceive pitch relies\\non both the firing rate of the hair cells in the basilar membrane as well as their location within the membrane.\\nIn terms of sound localization, both monaural and binaural cues are used to locate where sounds originate in\\nour environment.\\nIndividuals can be born deaf, or they can develop deafness as a result of age, genetic predisposition, and/or\\nenvironmental causes. Hearing loss that results from a failure of the vibration of the eardrum or the resultant\\nmovement of the ossicles is called conductive hearing loss. Hearing loss that involves a failure of the\\n174 5 • Summary\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\ntransmission of auditory nerve impulses to the brain is called sensorineural hearing loss.\\n5.5 The Other Senses\\nTaste (gustation) and smell (olfaction) are chemical senses that employ receptors on the tongue and in the\\nnose that bind directly with taste and odor molecules in order to transmit information to the brain for\\nprocessing. Our ability to perceive touch, temperature, and pain is mediated by a number of receptors and free\\nnerve endings that are distributed throughout the skin and various tissues of the body. The vestibular sense\\nhelps us maintain a sense of balance through the response of hair cells in the utricle, saccule, and semi-\\ncircular canals that respond to changes in head position and gravity. Our proprioceptive and kinesthetic\\nsystems provide information about body position and body movement through receptors that detect stretch\\nand tension in the muscles, joints, tendons, and skin of the body.\\n5.6 Gestalt Principles of Perception\\nGestalt theorists have been incredibly influential in the areas of sensation and perception. Gestalt principles\\nsuch as figure-ground relationship, grouping by proximity or similarity, the law of good continuation, and\\nclosure are all used to help explain how we organize sensory information. Our perceptions are not infallible,\\nand they can be influenced by bias, prejudice, and other factors.\\nReview Questions\\n1. ________ refers to the minimum amount of stimulus energy required to be detected 50% of the time.\\na. absolute threshold\\nb. difference threshold\\nc. just noticeable difference\\nd. transduction\\n2.

You might be struck by movement everywhere as cars and people go about their business, by the sound of a street musician’s melody or a horn honking in the distance, by the smell of exhaust fumes or of food being sold by a nearby vendor, and by the sensation of hard pavement under your feet. We rely on our sensory systems to provide important information about our surroundings. We use this information to successfully navigate and interact with our environment so that we can find nourishment, seek shelter, maintain social relationships, and avoid potentially dangerous situations. This chapter will provide an overview of how sensory information is received and processed by the nervous system and how that affects our conscious experience of the world. We begin by learning the distinction between sensation and perception. Next, we explore the properties of light and sound waves, as well as how they are perceived by our eyes and ears, respectively. The chapter then turns to the study of vision, hearing, and the other senses, including touch and smell. Finally, the chapter discusses the principles of perception and how they can be applied to our everyday lives. Sensory Systems The nervous system is a complex network of nerve cells (neurons) that transmit and receive information from the outside world, such as light, sound, touch, smell, taste, sight, etc. These neurons are organized into different types of neurons, each with its own specific function. For example, there are sensory neurons that receive information from our sense organs (eyes, ears) and transmit that information to other parts of our nervous system. There are also motor neurons (nerve cells that send signals to muscles to cause them to contract or relax), which are responsible for controlling the movement of muscles in response to signals received from other neurons. The sensory system receives and processes information in a variety of ways, depending on the type of input that is being received. Sensory information can come in many different forms. Some of these forms include visual, auditory, olfactory (smell), gustatory (taste), tactile (touch), and proprioceptive (body position and movement) information. Each sensory type has a unique way of processing and interpreting the information it receives, which is referred to as its “type of sensation”. Types of Sensations There are two main categories of sensations: physical sensations and emotional sensations. Physical sensations are those that involve the body’s internal organs and systems. Examples of physical sensory types include pain, temperature, pressure, vibration, cold, heat, humidity, moisture, motion, gravity, vision, sight, audition (hearing), olfaction (嗅觉), taste (salty, sweet, sour, bitter, umami), touch (warm, cool, rough, smooth), and proprioception (position, movement, balance). Emotional sensations refer to feelings and emotions that arise from interactions with the external world. Examples of emotional types include fear, anxiety, anger, sadness, happiness, joy, surprise, excitement, disgust, disgust, shame, guilt, embarrassment, pride, contempt, fear of death, love, hate, jealousy, envy, sympathy, compassion, gratitude, awe, wonder, curiosity,', 'references': '{\"sections\": [\"Sensation and Perception/Vision\", \"Learning/Classical Conditioning\"], \"pages\": [\"158\", \"159\", \"186\"]}'}\n",

This interdisciplinary approach is often referred to as\\nneuroscience, of which biological psychology is a component (Carlson, 2013).\\nWhile biopsychology typically focuses on the immediate causes of behavior based in the physiology of a\\nhuman or other animal, evolutionary psychology seeks to study the ultimate biological causes of behavior. To\\nthe extent that a behavior is impacted by genetics, a behavior, like any anatomical characteristic of a human or\\nanimal, will demonstrate adaption to its surroundings. These surroundings include the physical environment\\nand, since interactions between organisms can be important to survival and reproduction, the social\\nenvironment. The study of behavior in the context of evolution has its origins with Charles Darwin, the co-\\ndiscoverer of the theory of evolution by natural selection. Darwin was well aware that behaviors should be\\nadaptive and wrote books titled, The Descent of Man (1871) and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and\\nAnimals (1872), to explore this field.\\nEvolutionary psychology, and specifically, the evolutionary psychology of humans, has enjoyed a resurgence in\\nrecent decades. To be subject to evolution by natural selection, a behavior must have a significant genetic\\ncause. In general, we expect all human cultures to express a behavior if it is caused genetically, since the\\ngenetic differences among human groups are small. The approach taken by most evolutionary psychologists is\\nto predict the outcome of a behavior in a particular situation based on evolutionary theory and then to make\\nobservations, or conduct experiments, to determine whether the results match the theory. It is important to\\nrecognize that these types of studies are not strong evidence that a behavior is adaptive, since they lack\\ninformation that the behavior is in some part genetic and not entirely cultural (Endler, 1986). Demonstrating\\nthat a trait, especially in humans, is naturally selected is extraordinarily difficult; perhaps for this reason,\\nsome evolutionary psychologists are content to assume the behaviors they study have genetic determinants\\n(Confer et al., 2010).\\nOne other drawback of evolutionary psychology is that the traits that we possess now evolved under\\nenvironmental and social conditions far back in human history, and we have a poor understanding of what\\nthese conditions were. This makes predictions about what is adaptive for a behavior difficult. Behavioral traits\\nneed not be adaptive under current conditions, only under the conditions of the past when they evolved, about\\nwhich we can only hypothesize.\\nThere are many areas of human behavior for which evolution can make predictions. Examples include\\nmemory, mate choice, relationships between kin, friendship and cooperation, parenting, social organization,\\nand status (Confer et al., 2010).\\nEvolutionary psychologists have had success in finding experimental correspondence between observations\\nand expectations. In one example, in a study of mate preference differences between men and women that\\nspanned 37 cultures, Buss (1989) found that women valued earning potential factors greater than men, and\\nmen valued potential reproductive factors (youth and attractiveness) greater than women in their prospective\\nmates. In general, the predictions were in line with the predictions of evolution, although there were deviations\\nin some cultures.\\nSensation and Perception\\nScientists interested in both physiological aspects of sensory systems as well as in the psychological\\nexperience of sensory information work within the area of sensation and perception (Figure 1.11). As such,\\nsensation and perception research is also quite interdisciplinary. Imagine walking between buildings as you\\nmove from one class to another. You are inundated with sights, sounds, touch sensations, and smells. You also\\nexperience the temperature of the air around you and maintain your balance as you make your way. These are\\n20 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nall factors of interest to someone working in the domain of sensation and perception.\\nFIGURE 1.11 When you look at this image, you may see a duck or a rabbit. The sensory information remains the\\nsame, but your perception can vary dramatically.\\nAs described in a later chapter that focuses on the results of studies in sensation and perception, our\\nexperience of our world is not as simple as the sum total of all of the sensory information (or sensations)\\ntogether. Rather, our experience (or perception) is complex and is influenced by where we focus our attention,\\nour previous experiences, and even our cultural backgrounds.\\nCognitive Psychology\\nAs mentioned in the previous section, the cognitive revolution created an impetus for psychologists to focus\\ntheir attention on better understanding the mind and mental processes that underlie behavior. Thus, cognitive\\npsychology is the area of psychology that focuses on studying cognitions, or thoughts, and their relationship to\\nour experiences and our actions. Like biological psychology, cognitive psychology is broad in its scope and\\noften involves collaborations among people from a diverse range of disciplinary backgrounds. This has led\\nsome to coin the term cognitive science to describe the interdisciplinary nature of this area of research (Miller,\\n2003).\\nCognitive psychologists have research interests that span a spectrum of topics, ranging from attention to\\nproblem solving to language to memory. The approaches used in studying these topics are equally diverse.\\nGiven such diversity, cognitive psychology is not captured in one chapter of this text per se; rather, various\\nconcepts related to cognitive psychology will be covered in relevant portions of the chapters in this text on\\nsensation and perception, thinking and intelligence, memory, lifespan development, social psychology, and\\ntherapy.\\nDevelopmental Psychology\\nDevelopmental psychology is the scientific study of development across a lifespan. Developmental\\npsychologists are interested in processes related to physical maturation. However, their focus is not limited to\\nthe physical changes associated with aging, as they also focus on changes in cognitive skills, moral reasoning,\\nsocial behavior, and other psychological attributes.\\nEarly developmental psychologists focused primarily on changes that occurred through reaching adulthood,\\nproviding enormous insight into the differences in physical, cognitive, and social capacities that exist between\\nvery young children and adults. For instance, research by Jean Piaget (Figure 1.12) demonstrated that very\\nyoung children do not demonstrate object permanence. Object permanence refers to the understanding that\\nphysical things continue to exist, even if they are hidden from us. If you were to show an adult a toy, and then\\nhide it behind a curtain, the adult knows that the toy still exists. However, very young infants act as if a hidden\\nobject no longer exists. The age at which object permanence is achieved is somewhat controversial (Munakata,\\nMcClelland, Johnson, and Siegler, 1997).\\n1.3 • Contemporary Psychology 21\\nFIGURE 1.12 Jean Piaget is famous for his theories regarding changes in cognitive ability that occur as we move\\nfrom infancy to adulthood.\\nWhile Piaget was focused on cognitive changes during infancy and childhood as we move to adulthood, there is\\nan increasing interest in extending research into the changes that occur much later in life. This may be\\nreflective of changing population demographics of developed nations as a whole. As more and more people live\\nlonger lives, the number of people of advanced age will continue to increase. Indeed, it is estimated that there\\nwere just over 40 million people aged 65 or older living in the United States in 2010. However, by 2020, this\\nnumber is expected to increase to about 55 million. By the year 2050, it is estimated that nearly 90 million\\npeople in this country will be 65 or older (Department of Health and Human Services, n.d.).\\nPersonality Psychology\\nPersonality psychology focuses on patterns of thoughts and behaviors that make each individual unique.\\nSeveral individuals (e.g., Freud and Maslow) that we have already discussed in our historical overview of\\npsychology, and the American psychologist Gordon Allport, contributed to early theories of personality. These\\nearly theorists attempted to explain how an individual’s personality develops from their given perspective. For\\nexample, Freud proposed that personality arose as conflicts between the conscious and unconscious parts of\\nthe mind were carried out over the lifespan. Specifically, Freud theorized that an individual went through\\nvarious psychosexual stages of development. According to Freud, adult personality would result from the\\nresolution of various conflicts that centered on the migration of erogenous (or sexual pleasure-producing)\\nzones from the oral (mouth) to the anus to the phallus to the genitals. Like many of Freud’s theories, this\\nparticular idea was controversial and did not lend itself to experimental tests (Person, 1980).\\nMore recently, the study of personality has taken on a more quantitative approach. Rather than explaining how\\npersonality arises, research is focused on identifying personality traits, measuring these traits, and\\ndetermining how these traits interact in a particular context to determine how a person will behave in any\\ngiven situation. Personality traits are relatively consistent patterns of thought and behavior, and many have\\nproposed that five trait dimensions are sufficient to capture the variations in personality seen across\\nindividuals. These five dimensions are known as the “Big Five” or the Five Factor model, and include\\ndimensions of conscientiousness, agreeableness, neuroticism, openness, and extraversion (Figure 1.13). Each\\nof these traits has been demonstrated to be relatively stable over the lifespan (e.g., Rantanen, Metsäpelto, Feldt,\\nPulkinnen, and Kokko, 2007; Soldz & Vaillant, 1999; McCrae & Costa, 2008) and is influenced by genetics (e.g.,\\nJang, Livesly, and Vernon, 1996).\\n22 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nFIGURE 1.13 Each of the dimensions of the Five Factor model is shown in this figure. The provided description\\nwould describe someone who scored highly on that given dimension. Someone with a lower score on a given\\ndimension could be described in opposite terms.\\nSocial Psychology\\nSocial psychology focuses on how we interact with and relate to others. Social psychologists conduct research\\non a wide variety of topics that include differences in how we explain our own behavior versus how we explain\\nthe behaviors of others, prejudice, and attraction, and how we resolve interpersonal conflicts. Social\\npsychologists have also sought to determine how being among other people changes our own behavior and\\npatterns of thinking.\\nThere are many interesting examples of social psychological research, and you will read about many of these\\nin a later chapter of this textbook. Until then, you will be introduced to one of the most controversial\\npsychological studies ever conducted. Stanley Milgram was an American social psychologist who is most\\nfamous for research that he conducted on obedience. After the holocaust, in 1961, a Nazi war criminal, Adolf\\nEichmann, who was accused of committing mass atrocities, was put on trial. Many people wondered how\\nGerman soldiers were capable of torturing prisoners in concentration camps, and they were unsatisfied with\\nthe excuses given by soldiers that they were simply following orders. At the time, most psychologists agreed\\nthat few people would be willing to inflict such extraordinary pain and suffering, simply because they were\\nobeying orders. Milgram decided to conduct research to determine whether or not this was true (Figure 1.14).\\nAs you will read later in the text, Milgram found that nearly two-thirds of his participants were willing to\\ndeliver what they believed to be lethal shocks to another person, simply because they were instructed to do so\\nby an authority figure (in this case, a man dressed in a lab coat). This was in spite of the fact that participants\\n1.3 • Contemporary Psychology 23\\nreceived payment for simply showing up for the research study and could have chosen not to inflict pain or\\nmore serious consequences on another person by withdrawing from the study. No one was actually hurt or\\nharmed in any way, Milgram’s experiment was a clever ruse that took advantage of research confederates,\\nthose who pretend to be participants in a research study who are actually working for the researcher and have\\nclear, specific directions on how to behave during the research study (Hock, 2009). Milgram’s and others’\\nstudies that involved deception and potential emotional harm to study participants catalyzed the development\\nof ethical guidelines for conducting psychological research that discourage the use of deception of research\\nsubjects, unless it can be argued not to cause harm and, in general, requiring informed consent of\\nparticipants.\\nFIGURE 1.14 Stanley Milgram’s research demonstrated just how far people will go in obeying orders from an\\nauthority figure.

I-O psychologists are often\\ninvolved in issues related to personnel management, organizational structure, and workplace environment.\\nBusinesses often seek the aid of I-O psychologists to make the best hiring decisions as well as to create an\\nenvironment that results in high levels of employee productivity and efficiency. In addition to its applied\\nnature, I-O psychology also involves conducting scientific research on behavior within I-O settings (Riggio,\\n2013).\\n24 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nthat personality is shaped, in some part, by experiences we have in childhood. These stages are discussed in\\ndetail in the chapter on personality.\\nPsychosocial Theory of Development\\nErik Erikson (1902–1994) (Figure 9.4), another stage theorist, took Freud’s theory and modified it as\\npsychosocial theory. Erikson’s psychosocial development theory emphasizes the social nature of our\\ndevelopment rather than its sexual nature. While Freud believed that personality is shaped only in childhood,\\nErikson proposed that personality development takes place all through the lifespan. Erikson suggested that\\nhow we interact with others is what affects our sense of self, or what he called the ego identity.\\nFIGURE 9.4 Erik Erikson proposed the psychosocial theory of development. In each stage of Erikson’s theory, there\\nis a psychosocial task that we must master in order to feel a sense of competence.\\nErikson proposed that we are motivated by a need to achieve competence in certain areas of our lives.\\nAccording to psychosocial theory, we experience eight stages of development over our lifespan, from infancy\\nthrough late adulthood. At each stage there is a conflict, or task, that we need to resolve. Successful completion\\nof each developmental task results in a sense of competence and a healthy personality. Failure to master these\\ntasks leads to feelings of inadequacy.\\nAccording to Erikson (1963), trust is the basis of our development during infancy (birth to 12 months).\\nTherefore, the primary task of this stage is trust versus mistrust. Infants are dependent upon their caregivers,\\nso caregivers who are responsive and sensitive to their infant’s needs help their baby to develop a sense of\\ntrust; their baby will see the world as a safe, predictable place. Unresponsive caregivers who do not meet their\\nbaby’s needs can engender feelings of anxiety, fear, and mistrust; their baby may see the world as\\nunpredictable.\\nAs toddlers (ages 1–3 years) begin to explore their world, they learn that they can control their actions and act\\non the environment to get results. They begin to show clear preferences for certain elements of the\\nenvironment, such as food, toys, and clothing. A toddler’s main task is to resolve the issue of autonomy versus\\nshame and doubt, by working to establish independence. This is the “me do it” stage. For example, we might\\nobserve a budding sense of autonomy in a 2-year-old child who wants to choose her clothes and dress herself.\\nAlthough her outfits might not be appropriate for the situation, her input in such basic decisions has an effect\\non her sense of independence. If denied the opportunity to act on her environment, she may begin to doubt her\\nabilities, which could lead to low self-esteem and feelings of shame.\\nOnce children reach the preschool stage (ages 3–6 years), they are capable of initiating activities and asserting\\ncontrol over their world through social interactions and play. According to Erikson, preschool children must\\nresolve the task of initiative versus guilt. By learning to plan and achieve goals while interacting with others,\\npreschool children can master this task. Those who do will develop self-confidence and feel a sense of purpose.\\nThose who are unsuccessful at this stage—with their initiative misfiring or stifled—may develop feelings of\\nguilt. How might over-controlling parents stifle a child’s initiative?\\n9.2 • Lifespan Theories 285\\nDuring the elementary school stage (ages 7–11), children face the task of industry versus inferiority. Children\\nbegin to compare themselves to their peers to see how they measure up. They either develop a sense of pride\\nand accomplishment in their schoolwork, sports, social activities, and family life, or they feel inferior and\\ninadequate when they don’t measure up. What are some things parents and teachers can do to help children\\ndevelop a sense of competence and a belief in themselves and their abilities?\\nIn adolescence (ages 12–18), children face the task of identity versus role confusion. According to Erikson, an\\nadolescent’s main task is developing a sense of self. Adolescents struggle with questions such as “Who am I?”\\nand “What do I want to do with my life?” Along the way, most adolescents try on many different selves to see\\nwhich ones fit. Adolescents who are successful at this stage have a strong sense of identity and are able to\\nremain true to their beliefs and values in the face of problems and other people’s perspectives. What happens\\nto apathetic adolescents, who do not make a conscious search for identity, or those who are pressured to\\nconform to their parents’ ideas for the future? These teens will have a weak sense of self and experience role\\nconfusion. They are unsure of their identity and confused about the future.\\nPeople in early adulthood (i.e., 20s through early 40s) are concerned with intimacy versus isolation. After we\\nhave developed a sense of self in adolescence, we are ready to share our life with others. Erikson said that we\\nmust have a strong sense of self before developing intimate relationships with others. Adults who do not\\ndevelop a positive self-concept in adolescence may experience feelings of loneliness and emotional isolation.\\nWhen people reach their 40s, they enter the time known as middle adulthood, which extends to the mid-60s.\\nThe social task of middle adulthood is generativity versus stagnation. Generativity involves finding your life’s\\nwork and contributing to the development of others, through activities such as volunteering, mentoring, and\\nraising children. Those who do not master this task may experience stagnation, having little connection with\\nothers and little interest in productivity and self-improvement.\\nFrom the mid-60s to the end of life, we are in the period of development known as late adulthood. Erikson’s\\ntask at this stage is called integrity versus despair. He said that people in late adulthood reflect on their lives\\nand feel either a sense of satisfaction or a sense of failure. People who feel proud of their accomplishments feel\\na sense of integrity, and they can look back on their lives with few regrets. However, people who are not\\nsuccessful at this stage may feel as if their life has been wasted. They focus on what “would have,” “should\\nhave,” and “could have” been. They face the end of their lives with feelings of bitterness, depression, and\\ndespair.

Instead of\\napproaching development from a psychoanalytical or psychosocial perspective, Piaget focused on children’s\\ncognitive growth. He believed that thinking is a central aspect of development and that children are naturally\\ninquisitive. However, he said that children do not think and reason like adults (Piaget, 1930, 1932). His theory\\nof cognitive development holds that our cognitive abilities develop through specific stages, which exemplifies\\nthe discontinuity approach to development. As we progress to a new stage, there is a distinct shift in how we\\nthink and reason.\\nFIGURE 9.5 Jean Piaget spent over 50 years studying children and how their minds develop.\\nPiaget said that children develop schemata to help them understand the world. Schemata are concepts\\n(mental models) that are used to help us categorize and interpret information. By the time children have\\nreached adulthood, they have created schemata for almost everything. When children learn new information,\\nthey adjust their schemata through two processes: assimilation and accommodation. First, they assimilate new\\ninformation or experiences in terms of their current schemata: assimilation is when they take in information\\nthat is comparable to what they already know. Accommodation describes when they change their schemata\\nbased on new information. This process continues as children interact with their environment.\\nFor example, 2-year-old Abdul learned the schema for dogs because his family has a Labrador retriever. When\\nAbdul sees other dogs in his picture books, he says, “Look mommy, dog!” Thus, he has assimilated them into\\n9.2 • Lifespan Theories 287\\nhis schema for dogs. One day, Abdul sees a sheep for the first time and says, “Look mommy, dog!” Having a\\nbasic schema that a dog is an animal with four legs and fur, Abdul thinks all furry, four-legged creatures are\\ndogs. When Abdul’s mom tells him that the animal he sees is a sheep, not a dog, Abdul must accommodate his\\nschema for dogs to include more information based on his new experiences. Abdul’s schema for dog was too\\nbroad, since not all furry, four-legged creatures are dogs. He now modifies his schema for dogs and forms a\\nnew one for sheep.\\nLike Freud and Erikson, Piaget thought development unfolds in a series of stages approximately associated\\nwith age ranges. He proposed a theory of cognitive development that unfolds in four stages: sensorimotor,\\npreoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational (Table 9.2).\\nPiaget’s Stages of Cognitive Development\\nAge\\n(years) Stage Description Developmental\\nissues\\n0–2 Sensorimotor World experienced through senses and actions Object permanence\\nStranger anxiety\\n2–6 Preoperational Use words and images to represent things, but lack logical\\nreasoning\\nPretend play\\nEgocentrism\\nLanguage\\ndevelopment\\n7–11 Concrete\\noperational\\nUnderstand concrete events and analogies logically; perform\\narithmetical operations\\nConservation\\nMathematical\\ntransformations\\n12– Formal\\noperational\\nFormal operations\\nUtilize abstract reasoning\\nAbstract logic\\nMoral reasoning\\nTABLE 9.2\\nThe first stage is the sensorimotor stage, which lasts from birth to about 2 years old. During this stage,\\nchildren learn about the world through their senses and motor behavior. Young children put objects in their\\nmouths to see if the items are edible, and once they can grasp objects, they may shake or bang them to see if\\nthey make sounds. Between 5 and 8 months old, the child develops object permanence, which is the\\nunderstanding that even if something is out of sight, it still exists (Bogartz, Shinskey, & Schilling, 2000).\\nAccording to Piaget, young infants do not remember an object after it has been removed from sight. Piaget\\nstudied infants’ reactions when a toy was first shown to an infant and then hidden under a blanket. Infants\\nwho had already developed object permanence would reach for the hidden toy, indicating that they knew it still\\nexisted, whereas infants who had not developed object permanence would appear confused.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nPlease take a few minutes and view this brief video demonstrating different children's abilities to understand\\nobject permanence (http://openstax.org/l/piaget) to learn more.\\nIn Piaget’s view, around the same time children develop object permanence, they also begin to exhibit stranger\\nanxiety, which is a fear of unfamiliar people. Babies may demonstrate this by crying and turning away from a\\nstranger, by clinging to a caregiver, or by attempting to reach their arms toward familiar faces such as parents.\\nStranger anxiety results when a child is unable to assimilate the stranger into an existing schema; therefore,\\n288 9 • Lifespan Development\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nshe can’t predict what her experience with that stranger will be like, which results in a fear response.\\nPiaget’s second stage is the preoperational stage, which is from approximately 2 to 7 years old. In this stage,\\nchildren can use symbols to represent words, images, and ideas, which is why children in this stage engage in\\npretend play. A child’s arms might become airplane wings as they zoom around the room, or a child with a\\nstick might become a brave knight with a sword. Children also begin to use language in the preoperational\\nstage, but they cannot understand adult logic or mentally manipulate information (the term operational refers\\nto logical manipulation of information, so children at this stage are considered to be pre-operational).\\nChildren’s logic is based on their own personal knowledge of the world so far, rather than on conventional\\nknowledge. For example, dad gave a slice of pizza to 10-year-old Keiko and another slice to her 3-year-old\\nbrother, Kenny. Kenny’s pizza slice was cut into five pieces, so Kenny told his sister that he got more pizza than\\nshe did. Children in this stage cannot perform mental operations because they have not developed an\\nunderstanding of conservation, which is the idea that even if you change the appearance of something, it is\\nstill equal in size as long as nothing has been removed or added.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nWatch this video of a boy in the preoperational stage responding to Piaget's conservation tasks\\n(http://openstax.org/l/piaget2) to learn more.\\nDuring this stage, we also expect children to display egocentrism, which means that the child is not able to\\ntake the perspective of others. A child at this stage thinks that everyone sees, thinks, and feels just as they do.\\nLet’s look at Kenny and Keiko again. Keiko’s birthday is coming up, so their mom takes Kenny to the toy store to\\nchoose a present for his sister. He selects an Iron Man action figure for her, thinking that if he likes the toy, his\\nsister will too. An egocentric child is not able to infer the perspective of other people and instead attributes his\\nown perspective.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nPiaget developed the Three-Mountain Task to determine the level of egocentrism displayed by children.\\nChildren view a 3-dimensional mountain scene from one viewpoint, and are asked what another person at a\\ndifferent viewpoint would see in the same scene. Watch this short video of the Three Mountain Task in action\\n(http://openstax.org/l/WonderYears) from the University of Minnesota and the Science Museum of Minnesota.\\nPiaget’s third stage is the concrete operational stage, which occurs from about 7 to 11 years old. In this stage,\\nchildren can think logically about real (concrete) events; they have a firm grasp on the use of numbers and\\nstart to employ memory strategies. They can perform mathematical operations and understand\\ntransformations, such as addition is the opposite of subtraction, and multiplication is the opposite of division.\\nIn this stage, children also master the concept of conservation: Even if something changes shape, its mass,\\nvolume, and number stay the same. For example, if you pour water from a tall, thin glass to a short, fat glass,\\nyou still have the same amount of water. Remember Keiko and Kenny and the pizza? How did Keiko know that\\nKenny was wrong when he said that he had more pizza?\\nChildren in the concrete operational stage also understand the principle of reversibility, which means that\\nobjects can be changed and then returned back to their original form or condition. Take, for example, water\\nthat you poured into the short, fat glass: You can pour water from the fat glass back to the thin glass and still\\nhave the same amount (minus a couple of drops).\\nThe fourth, and last, stage in Piaget’s theory is the formal operational stage, which is from about age 11 to\\nadulthood. Whereas children in the concrete operational stage are able to think logically only about concrete\\nevents, children in the formal operational stage can also deal with abstract ideas and hypothetical situations.\\nChildren in this stage can use abstract thinking to problem solve, look at alternative solutions, and test these\\n9.2 • Lifespan Theories 289\\nKey Terms\\naccommodation adjustment of a schema by changing a scheme to accommodate new information different\\nfrom what was already known\\nadolescence period of development that begins at puberty and ends at early adulthood\\nadrenarche maturing of the adrenal glands\\nadvance directive a written legal document that details specific interventions a person wants (see living will)\\nassimilation adjustment of a schema by adding information similar to what is already known\\nattachment long-standing connection or bond with others\\nauthoritarian parenting style parents place a high value on conformity and obedience, are often rigid, and\\nexpress little warmth to the child\\nauthoritative parenting style parents give children reasonable demands and consistent limits, express\\nwarmth and affection, and listen to the child’s point of view\\navoidant attachment characterized by child’s unresponsiveness to parent, does not use the parent as a secure\\nbase, and does not care if parent leaves\\ncognitive development domain of lifespan development that examines learning, attention, memory,\\nlanguage, thinking, reasoning, and creativity\\ncognitive empathy ability to take the perspective of others and to feel concern for others\\nconception when a sperm fertilizes an egg and forms a zygote\\nconcrete operational stage third stage in Piaget’s theory of cognitive development;

They view development as a lifelong process that can be studied\\nscientifically across three developmental domains: physical, cognitive development, and psychosocial. There\\nare several theories of development that focus on the following issues: whether development is continuous or\\ndiscontinuous, whether development follows one course or many, and the relative influence of nature versus\\nnurture on development.\\n9.2 Lifespan Theories\\nThere are many theories regarding how babies and children grow and develop into happy, healthy adults.\\nSigmund Freud suggested that we pass through a series of psychosexual stages in which our energy is focused\\non certain erogenous zones on the body. Eric Erikson modified Freud’s ideas and suggested a theory of\\npsychosocial development. Erikson said that our social interactions and successful completion of social tasks\\nshape our sense of self. Jean Piaget proposed a theory of cognitive development that explains how children\\nthink and reason as they move through various stages. Finally, Lawrence Kohlberg turned his attention to\\nmoral development. He said that we pass through three levels of moral thinking that build on our cognitive\\ndevelopment.\\n9.3 Stages of Development\\nAt conception the egg and sperm cell are united to form a zygote, which will begin to divide rapidly. This marks\\nthe beginning of the first stage of prenatal development (germinal stage), which lasts about two weeks. Then\\nthe zygote implants itself into the lining of the uterus, marking the beginning of the second stage of prenatal\\ndevelopment (embryonic stage), which lasts about six weeks. The embryo begins to develop body and organ\\nstructures, and the neural tube forms, which will later become the brain and spinal cord. The third phase of\\nprenatal development (fetal stage) begins at 9 weeks and lasts until birth. The body, brain, and organs grow\\nrapidly during this stage. During all stages of pregnancy it is important that the parent receive prenatal care to\\nreduce health risks to themself and to the developing baby.\\nNewborn infants weigh about 7.5 pounds. Doctors assess a newborn’s reflexes, such as the sucking, rooting,\\nand Moro reflexes. Our physical, cognitive, and psychosocial skills grow and change as we move through\\ndevelopmental stages from infancy through late adulthood. Attachment in infancy is a critical component of\\nhealthy development. Parenting styles have been found to have an effect on childhood outcomes of well-being.\\nThe transition from adolescence to adulthood can be challenging due to the timing of puberty, and due to the\\nextended amount of time spent in emerging adulthood. Although physical decline begins in middle adulthood,\\ncognitive decline does not begin until later. Activities that keep the body and mind active can help maintain\\ngood physical and cognitive health as we age. Social supports through family and friends remain important as\\nwe age.\\n9.4 Death and Dying\\nDeath marks the endpoint of our lifespan. There are many ways that we might react when facing death. Kübler-\\nRoss developed a five-stage model of grief as a way to explain this process. Many people facing death choose\\nhospice care, which allows their last days to be spent at home in a comfortable, supportive environment.\\nReview Questions\\n1.

Context: sensory and motor systems, sleep, drug use and abuse, ingestive behavior, reproductive behavior, neurodevelopment, plasticity of the nervous system, and biological correlates of psychological disorders. Given the broad areas of interest falling under the purview of biological psychology, it will probably come as no surprise that individuals from all sorts of backgrounds are involved in this research, including biologists, medical professionals, physiologists, and chemists. This interdisciplinary approach is often referred to as neuroscience, of which biological psychology is a component (Carlson, 2013). While biopsychology typically focuses on the immediate causes of behavior based in the physiology of a human or other animal, evolutionary psychology seeks to study the ultimate biological causes of behavior. To the extent that a behavior is impacted by genetics, a behavior, like any anatomical characteristic of a human or animal, will demonstrate adaption to its surroundings. These surroundings include the physical environment and, since interactions between organisms can be important to survival and reproduction, the social environment. The study of behavior in the context of evolution has its origins with Charles Darwin, the co- discoverer of the theory of evolution by natural selection. Darwin was well aware that behaviors should be adaptive and wrote books titled, The Descent of Man (1871) and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872), to explore this field. Evolutionary psychology, and specifically, the evolutionary psychology of humans, has enjoyed a resurgence in recent decades. To be subject to evolution by natural selection, a behavior must have a significant genetic cause. In general, we expect all human cultures to express a behavior if it is caused genetically, since the genetic differences among human groups are small. The approach taken by most evolutionary psychologists is to predict the outcome of a behavior in a particular situation based on evolutionary theory and then to make observations, or conduct experiments, to determine whether the results match the theory. It is important to recognize that these types of studies are not strong evidence that a behavior is adaptive, since they lack information that the behavior is in some part genetic and not entirely cultural (Endler, 1986). Demonstrating that a trait, especially one that has been shown to be adaptive in other species, is also found in humans is an important step toward understanding the adaptive nature of human behavior. In this chapter, you will learn about the basic concepts of behavioral genetics and evolutionary psychology. You will also be introduced to the field of neurobiology, which studies the brain and behavior in humans and other animals. Neurobiologists are interested in how the human brain works and how it responds to environmental stimuli, such as learning and memory. They also study how changes in brain structure and function can lead to neurological disorders. Finally, neuroscientists use brain imaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography (PET), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and electroencephalogram (EEG) to observe brain activity in response to different stimuli and to investigate the neural mechanisms that underlie learning, memory, attention, perception, emotion, motivation, decision-making, stress, anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, addiction, personality, aging, brain injury, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, autism, Tourette's syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), schizophrenia, alcoholism, eating disorders, sexual dysfunction, mood disorders (depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, etc.), and addiction (e.g., cocaine, amphetamines, opiates, marijuana, nicotine, heroin, methadone, cocaine, morphine, alprazolam, benzodiazepines, barbiturates), as well as how these disorders are diagnosed and treated. This chapter is divided into three sections. Section 3.1 provides an overview of basic principles of behavioral genetics. Specifically, this section covers the following topics: (a) the concept of heritability, (b) the role of genes and environment in determining the likelihood that an individual will exhibit certain behaviors and (c) how environmental factors can influence the expression of genetic traits. (Section 4.2) provides a brief introduction to evolutionary biology, with a focus on human evolution and the role that evolution has played in shaping our behavior and our understanding of ourselves as a species. Lastly, Section 5.3 discusses the neurobiological underpinnings of mental disorders and their relationship to behavioral disorders. Each of these sections is followed by a set of exercises that will help you apply the concepts discussed in that section to your own research.\", 'references': '{\"sections\": [\"Lifespan Development/Stages of Development\", \"Emotion and Motivation/Hunger and Eating\", \"Introduction to Psychology\"], \"pages\": [\"299\", \"329\", \"34\"]}'}\n",

While biological\\npsychology is a broad field, many biological psychologists want to understand how the structure and function\\nof the nervous system is related to behavior (Figure 1.10). As such, they often combine the research strategies\\nof both psychologists and physiologists to accomplish this goal (as discussed in Carlson, 2013).\\nFIGURE 1.10 Biological psychologists study how the structure and function of the nervous system generate\\nbehavior.\\nThe research interests of biological psychologists span a number of domains, including but not limited to,\\n1.3 • Contemporary Psychology 19\\nsensory and motor systems, sleep, drug use and abuse, ingestive behavior, reproductive behavior,\\nneurodevelopment, plasticity of the nervous system, and biological correlates of psychological disorders.\\nGiven the broad areas of interest falling under the purview of biological psychology, it will probably come as no\\nsurprise that individuals from all sorts of backgrounds are involved in this research, including biologists,\\nmedical professionals, physiologists, and chemists. This interdisciplinary approach is often referred to as\\nneuroscience, of which biological psychology is a component (Carlson, 2013).\\nWhile biopsychology typically focuses on the immediate causes of behavior based in the physiology of a\\nhuman or other animal, evolutionary psychology seeks to study the ultimate biological causes of behavior. To\\nthe extent that a behavior is impacted by genetics, a behavior, like any anatomical characteristic of a human or\\nanimal, will demonstrate adaption to its surroundings. These surroundings include the physical environment\\nand, since interactions between organisms can be important to survival and reproduction, the social\\nenvironment. The study of behavior in the context of evolution has its origins with Charles Darwin, the co-\\ndiscoverer of the theory of evolution by natural selection. Darwin was well aware that behaviors should be\\nadaptive and wrote books titled, The Descent of Man (1871) and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and\\nAnimals (1872), to explore this field.\\nEvolutionary psychology, and specifically, the evolutionary psychology of humans, has enjoyed a resurgence in\\nrecent decades. To be subject to evolution by natural selection, a behavior must have a significant genetic\\ncause. In general, we expect all human cultures to express a behavior if it is caused genetically, since the\\ngenetic differences among human groups are small. The approach taken by most evolutionary psychologists is\\nto predict the outcome of a behavior in a particular situation based on evolutionary theory and then to make\\nobservations, or conduct experiments, to determine whether the results match the theory. It is important to\\nrecognize that these types of studies are not strong evidence that a behavior is adaptive, since they lack\\ninformation that the behavior is in some part genetic and not entirely cultural (Endler, 1986). Demonstrating\\nthat a trait, especially in humans, is naturally selected is extraordinarily difficult; perhaps for this reason,\\nsome evolutionary psychologists are content to assume the behaviors they study have genetic determinants\\n(Confer et al., 2010).\\nOne other drawback of evolutionary psychology is that the traits that we possess now evolved under\\nenvironmental and social conditions far back in human history, and we have a poor understanding of what\\nthese conditions were. This makes predictions about what is adaptive for a behavior difficult. Behavioral traits\\nneed not be adaptive under current conditions, only under the conditions of the past when they evolved, about\\nwhich we can only hypothesize.\\nThere are many areas of human behavior for which evolution can make predictions. Examples include\\nmemory, mate choice, relationships between kin, friendship and cooperation, parenting, social organization,\\nand status (Confer et al., 2010).\\nEvolutionary psychologists have had success in finding experimental correspondence between observations\\nand expectations. In one example, in a study of mate preference differences between men and women that\\nspanned 37 cultures, Buss (1989) found that women valued earning potential factors greater than men, and\\nmen valued potential reproductive factors (youth and attractiveness) greater than women in their prospective\\nmates. In general, the predictions were in line with the predictions of evolution, although there were deviations\\nin some cultures.\\nSensation and Perception\\nScientists interested in both physiological aspects of sensory systems as well as in the psychological\\nexperience of sensory information work within the area of sensation and perception (Figure 1.11). As such,\\nsensation and perception research is also quite interdisciplinary. Imagine walking between buildings as you\\nmove from one class to another. You are inundated with sights, sounds, touch sensations, and smells. You also\\nexperience the temperature of the air around you and maintain your balance as you make your way. These are\\n20 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nall factors of interest to someone working in the domain of sensation and perception.\\nFIGURE 1.11 When you look at this image, you may see a duck or a rabbit. The sensory information remains the\\nsame, but your perception can vary dramatically.\\nAs described in a later chapter that focuses on the results of studies in sensation and perception, our\\nexperience of our world is not as simple as the sum total of all of the sensory information (or sensations)\\ntogether. Rather, our experience (or perception) is complex and is influenced by where we focus our attention,\\nour previous experiences, and even our cultural backgrounds.\\nCognitive Psychology\\nAs mentioned in the previous section, the cognitive revolution created an impetus for psychologists to focus\\ntheir attention on better understanding the mind and mental processes that underlie behavior. Thus, cognitive\\npsychology is the area of psychology that focuses on studying cognitions, or thoughts, and their relationship to\\nour experiences and our actions. Like biological psychology, cognitive psychology is broad in its scope and\\noften involves collaborations among people from a diverse range of disciplinary backgrounds. This has led\\nsome to coin the term cognitive science to describe the interdisciplinary nature of this area of research (Miller,\\n2003).\\nCognitive psychologists have research interests that span a spectrum of topics, ranging from attention to\\nproblem solving to language to memory. The approaches used in studying these topics are equally diverse.\\nGiven such diversity, cognitive psychology is not captured in one chapter of this text per se; rather, various\\nconcepts related to cognitive psychology will be covered in relevant portions of the chapters in this text on\\nsensation and perception, thinking and intelligence, memory, lifespan development, social psychology, and\\ntherapy.\\nDevelopmental Psychology\\nDevelopmental psychology is the scientific study of development across a lifespan. Developmental\\npsychologists are interested in processes related to physical maturation. However, their focus is not limited to\\nthe physical changes associated with aging, as they also focus on changes in cognitive skills, moral reasoning,\\nsocial behavior, and other psychological attributes.\\nEarly developmental psychologists focused primarily on changes that occurred through reaching adulthood,\\nproviding enormous insight into the differences in physical, cognitive, and social capacities that exist between\\nvery young children and adults. For instance, research by Jean Piaget (Figure 1.12) demonstrated that very\\nyoung children do not demonstrate object permanence. Object permanence refers to the understanding that\\nphysical things continue to exist, even if they are hidden from us. If you were to show an adult a toy, and then\\nhide it behind a curtain, the adult knows that the toy still exists. However, very young infants act as if a hidden\\nobject no longer exists. The age at which object permanence is achieved is somewhat controversial (Munakata,\\nMcClelland, Johnson, and Siegler, 1997).\\n1.3 • Contemporary Psychology 21\\nFIGURE 1.12 Jean Piaget is famous for his theories regarding changes in cognitive ability that occur as we move\\nfrom infancy to adulthood.\\nWhile Piaget was focused on cognitive changes during infancy and childhood as we move to adulthood, there is\\nan increasing interest in extending research into the changes that occur much later in life. This may be\\nreflective of changing population demographics of developed nations as a whole. As more and more people live\\nlonger lives, the number of people of advanced age will continue to increase. Indeed, it is estimated that there\\nwere just over 40 million people aged 65 or older living in the United States in 2010. However, by 2020, this\\nnumber is expected to increase to about 55 million. By the year 2050, it is estimated that nearly 90 million\\npeople in this country will be 65 or older (Department of Health and Human Services, n.d.).\\nPersonality Psychology\\nPersonality psychology focuses on patterns of thoughts and behaviors that make each individual unique.\\nSeveral individuals (e.g., Freud and Maslow) that we have already discussed in our historical overview of\\npsychology, and the American psychologist Gordon Allport, contributed to early theories of personality. These\\nearly theorists attempted to explain how an individual’s personality develops from their given perspective. For\\nexample, Freud proposed that personality arose as conflicts between the conscious and unconscious parts of\\nthe mind were carried out over the lifespan. Specifically, Freud theorized that an individual went through\\nvarious psychosexual stages of development. According to Freud, adult personality would result from the\\nresolution of various conflicts that centered on the migration of erogenous (or sexual pleasure-producing)\\nzones from the oral (mouth) to the anus to the phallus to the genitals. Like many of Freud’s theories, this\\nparticular idea was controversial and did not lend itself to experimental tests (Person, 1980).\\nMore recently, the study of personality has taken on a more quantitative approach. Rather than explaining how\\npersonality arises, research is focused on identifying personality traits, measuring these traits, and\\ndetermining how these traits interact in a particular context to determine how a person will behave in any\\ngiven situation. Personality traits are relatively consistent patterns of thought and behavior, and many have\\nproposed that five trait dimensions are sufficient to capture the variations in personality seen across\\nindividuals. These five dimensions are known as the “Big Five” or the Five Factor model, and include\\ndimensions of conscientiousness, agreeableness, neuroticism, openness, and extraversion (Figure 1.13). Each\\nof these traits has been demonstrated to be relatively stable over the lifespan (e.g., Rantanen, Metsäpelto, Feldt,\\nPulkinnen, and Kokko, 2007; Soldz & Vaillant, 1999; McCrae & Costa, 2008) and is influenced by genetics (e.g.,\\nJang, Livesly, and Vernon, 1996).\\n22 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nFIGURE 1.13 Each of the dimensions of the Five Factor model is shown in this figure. The provided description\\nwould describe someone who scored highly on that given dimension. Someone with a lower score on a given\\ndimension could be described in opposite terms.\\nSocial Psychology\\nSocial psychology focuses on how we interact with and relate to others. Social psychologists conduct research\\non a wide variety of topics that include differences in how we explain our own behavior versus how we explain\\nthe behaviors of others, prejudice, and attraction, and how we resolve interpersonal conflicts. Social\\npsychologists have also sought to determine how being among other people changes our own behavior and\\npatterns of thinking.\\nThere are many interesting examples of social psychological research, and you will read about many of these\\nin a later chapter of this textbook. Until then, you will be introduced to one of the most controversial\\npsychological studies ever conducted. Stanley Milgram was an American social psychologist who is most\\nfamous for research that he conducted on obedience. After the holocaust, in 1961, a Nazi war criminal, Adolf\\nEichmann, who was accused of committing mass atrocities, was put on trial. Many people wondered how\\nGerman soldiers were capable of torturing prisoners in concentration camps, and they were unsatisfied with\\nthe excuses given by soldiers that they were simply following orders. At the time, most psychologists agreed\\nthat few people would be willing to inflict such extraordinary pain and suffering, simply because they were\\nobeying orders. Milgram decided to conduct research to determine whether or not this was true (Figure 1.14).\\nAs you will read later in the text, Milgram found that nearly two-thirds of his participants were willing to\\ndeliver what they believed to be lethal shocks to another person, simply because they were instructed to do so\\nby an authority figure (in this case, a man dressed in a lab coat). This was in spite of the fact that participants\\n1.3 • Contemporary Psychology 23\\nDuring the elementary school stage (ages 7–11), children face the task of industry versus inferiority. Children\\nbegin to compare themselves to their peers to see how they measure up. They either develop a sense of pride\\nand accomplishment in their schoolwork, sports, social activities, and family life, or they feel inferior and\\ninadequate when they don’t measure up. What are some things parents and teachers can do to help children\\ndevelop a sense of competence and a belief in themselves and their abilities?\\nIn adolescence (ages 12–18), children face the task of identity versus role confusion. According to Erikson, an\\nadolescent’s main task is developing a sense of self. Adolescents struggle with questions such as “Who am I?”\\nand “What do I want to do with my life?” Along the way, most adolescents try on many different selves to see\\nwhich ones fit. Adolescents who are successful at this stage have a strong sense of identity and are able to\\nremain true to their beliefs and values in the face of problems and other people’s perspectives. What happens\\nto apathetic adolescents, who do not make a conscious search for identity, or those who are pressured to\\nconform to their parents’ ideas for the future? These teens will have a weak sense of self and experience role\\nconfusion. They are unsure of their identity and confused about the future.\\nPeople in early adulthood (i.e., 20s through early 40s) are concerned with intimacy versus isolation. After we\\nhave developed a sense of self in adolescence, we are ready to share our life with others. Erikson said that we\\nmust have a strong sense of self before developing intimate relationships with others. Adults who do not\\ndevelop a positive self-concept in adolescence may experience feelings of loneliness and emotional isolation.\\nWhen people reach their 40s, they enter the time known as middle adulthood, which extends to the mid-60s.\\nThe social task of middle adulthood is generativity versus stagnation. Generativity involves finding your life’s\\nwork and contributing to the development of others, through activities such as volunteering, mentoring, and\\nraising children. Those who do not master this task may experience stagnation, having little connection with\\nothers and little interest in productivity and self-improvement.\\nFrom the mid-60s to the end of life, we are in the period of development known as late adulthood. Erikson’s\\ntask at this stage is called integrity versus despair. He said that people in late adulthood reflect on their lives\\nand feel either a sense of satisfaction or a sense of failure. People who feel proud of their accomplishments feel\\na sense of integrity, and they can look back on their lives with few regrets. However, people who are not\\nsuccessful at this stage may feel as if their life has been wasted. They focus on what “would have,” “should\\nhave,” and “could have” been. They face the end of their lives with feelings of bitterness, depression, and\\ndespair.

Instead of\\napproaching development from a psychoanalytical or psychosocial perspective, Piaget focused on children’s\\ncognitive growth. He believed that thinking is a central aspect of development and that children are naturally\\ninquisitive. However, he said that children do not think and reason like adults (Piaget, 1930, 1932). His theory\\nof cognitive development holds that our cognitive abilities develop through specific stages, which exemplifies\\nthe discontinuity approach to development. As we progress to a new stage, there is a distinct shift in how we\\nthink and reason.\\nFIGURE 9.5 Jean Piaget spent over 50 years studying children and how their minds develop.\\nPiaget said that children develop schemata to help them understand the world. Schemata are concepts\\n(mental models) that are used to help us categorize and interpret information. By the time children have\\nreached adulthood, they have created schemata for almost everything. When children learn new information,\\nthey adjust their schemata through two processes: assimilation and accommodation. First, they assimilate new\\ninformation or experiences in terms of their current schemata: assimilation is when they take in information\\nthat is comparable to what they already know. Accommodation describes when they change their schemata\\nbased on new information. This process continues as children interact with their environment.\\nFor example, 2-year-old Abdul learned the schema for dogs because his family has a Labrador retriever. When\\nAbdul sees other dogs in his picture books, he says, “Look mommy, dog!” Thus, he has assimilated them into\\n9.2 • Lifespan Theories 287\\nhis schema for dogs. One day, Abdul sees a sheep for the first time and says, “Look mommy, dog!” Having a\\nbasic schema that a dog is an animal with four legs and fur, Abdul thinks all furry, four-legged creatures are\\ndogs. When Abdul’s mom tells him that the animal he sees is a sheep, not a dog, Abdul must accommodate his\\nschema for dogs to include more information based on his new experiences. Abdul’s schema for dog was too\\nbroad, since not all furry, four-legged creatures are dogs. He now modifies his schema for dogs and forms a\\nnew one for sheep.\\nLike Freud and Erikson, Piaget thought development unfolds in a series of stages approximately associated\\nwith age ranges. He proposed a theory of cognitive development that unfolds in four stages: sensorimotor,\\npreoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational (Table 9.2).\\nPiaget’s Stages of Cognitive Development\\nAge\\n(years) Stage Description Developmental\\nissues\\n0–2 Sensorimotor World experienced through senses and actions Object permanence\\nStranger anxiety\\n2–6 Preoperational Use words and images to represent things, but lack logical\\nreasoning\\nPretend play\\nEgocentrism\\nLanguage\\ndevelopment\\n7–11 Concrete\\noperational\\nUnderstand concrete events and analogies logically; perform\\narithmetical operations\\nConservation\\nMathematical\\ntransformations\\n12– Formal\\noperational\\nFormal operations\\nUtilize abstract reasoning\\nAbstract logic\\nMoral reasoning\\nTABLE 9.2\\nThe first stage is the sensorimotor stage, which lasts from birth to about 2 years old. During this stage,\\nchildren learn about the world through their senses and motor behavior. Young children put objects in their\\nmouths to see if the items are edible, and once they can grasp objects, they may shake or bang them to see if\\nthey make sounds. Between 5 and 8 months old, the child develops object permanence, which is the\\nunderstanding that even if something is out of sight, it still exists (Bogartz, Shinskey, & Schilling, 2000).\\nAccording to Piaget, young infants do not remember an object after it has been removed from sight. Piaget\\nstudied infants’ reactions when a toy was first shown to an infant and then hidden under a blanket. Infants\\nwho had already developed object permanence would reach for the hidden toy, indicating that they knew it still\\nexisted, whereas infants who had not developed object permanence would appear confused.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nPlease take a few minutes and view this brief video demonstrating different children\\'s abilities to understand\\nobject permanence (http://openstax.org/l/piaget) to learn more.\\nIn Piaget’s view, around the same time children develop object permanence, they also begin to exhibit stranger\\nanxiety, which is a fear of unfamiliar people. Babies may demonstrate this by crying and turning away from a\\nstranger, by clinging to a caregiver, or by attempting to reach their arms toward familiar faces such as parents.\\nStranger anxiety results when a child is unable to assimilate the stranger into an existing schema; therefore,\\n288 9 • Lifespan Development\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nshe can’t predict what her experience with that stranger will be like, which results in a fear response.\\nPiaget’s second stage is the preoperational stage, which is from approximately 2 to 7 years old. In this stage,\\nchildren can use symbols to represent words, images, and ideas, which is why children in this stage engage in\\npretend play. A child’s arms might become airplane wings as they zoom around the room, or a child with a\\nstick might become a brave knight with a sword. Children also begin to use language in the preoperational\\nstage, but they cannot understand adult logic or mentally manipulate information (the term operational refers\\nto logical manipulation of information, so children at this stage are considered to be pre-operational).\\nChildren’s logic is based on their own personal knowledge of the world so far, rather than on conventional\\nknowledge. For example, dad gave a slice of pizza to 10-year-old Keiko and another slice to her 3-year-old\\nbrother, Kenny. Kenny’s pizza slice was cut into five pieces, so Kenny told his sister that he got more pizza than\\nshe did. Children in this stage cannot perform mental operations because they have not developed an\\nunderstanding of conservation, which is the idea that even if you change the appearance of something, it is\\nstill equal in size as long as nothing has been removed or added.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nWatch this video of a boy in the preoperational stage responding to Piaget\\'s conservation tasks\\n(http://openstax.org/l/piaget2) to learn more.\\nDuring this stage, we also expect children to display egocentrism, which means that the child is not able to\\ntake the perspective of others. A child at this stage thinks that everyone sees, thinks, and feels just as they do.\\nLet’s look at Kenny and Keiko again. Keiko’s birthday is coming up, so their mom takes Kenny to the toy store to\\nchoose a present for his sister. He selects an Iron Man action figure for her, thinking that if he likes the toy, his\\nsister will too. An egocentric child is not able to infer the perspective of other people and instead attributes his\\nown perspective.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nPiaget developed the Three-Mountain Task to determine the level of egocentrism displayed by children.\\nChildren view a 3-dimensional mountain scene from one viewpoint, and are asked what another person at a\\ndifferent viewpoint would see in the same scene. Watch this short video of the Three Mountain Task in action\\n(http://openstax.org/l/WonderYears) from the University of Minnesota and the Science Museum of Minnesota.\\nPiaget’s third stage is the concrete operational stage, which occurs from about 7 to 11 years old. In this stage,\\nchildren can think logically about real (concrete) events; they have a firm grasp on the use of numbers and\\nstart to employ memory strategies. They can perform mathematical operations and understand\\ntransformations, such as addition is the opposite of subtraction, and multiplication is the opposite of division.\\nIn this stage, children also master the concept of conservation: Even if something changes shape, its mass,\\nvolume, and number stay the same. For example, if you pour water from a tall, thin glass to a short, fat glass,\\nyou still have the same amount of water. Remember Keiko and Kenny and the pizza? How did Keiko know that\\nKenny was wrong when he said that he had more pizza?\\nChildren in the concrete operational stage also understand the principle of reversibility, which means that\\nobjects can be changed and then returned back to their original form or condition. Take, for example, water\\nthat you poured into the short, fat glass: You can pour water from the fat glass back to the thin glass and still\\nhave the same amount (minus a couple of drops).\\nThe fourth, and last, stage in Piaget’s theory is the formal operational stage, which is from about age 11 to\\nadulthood. Whereas children in the concrete operational stage are able to think logically only about concrete\\nevents, children in the formal operational stage can also deal with abstract ideas and hypothetical situations.\\nChildren in this stage can use abstract thinking to problem solve, look at alternative solutions, and test these\\n9.2 • Lifespan Theories 289\\nsolutions. In adolescence, a renewed egocentrism occurs. For example, a 15-year-old with a very small pimple\\non her face might think it is huge and incredibly visible, under the mistaken impression that others must share\\nher perceptions.\\nBeyond Formal Operational Thought\\nAs with other major contributors of theories of development, several of Piaget’s ideas have come under\\ncriticism based on the results of further research. For example, several contemporary studies support a model\\nof development that is more continuous than Piaget’s discrete stages (Courage & Howe, 2002; Siegler, 2005,\\n2006). Many others suggest that children reach cognitive milestones earlier than Piaget describes (Baillargeon,\\n2004; de Hevia & Spelke, 2010).\\nAccording to Piaget, the highest level of cognitive development is formal operational thought, which develops\\nbetween 11 and 20 years old. However, many developmental psychologists disagree with Piaget, suggesting a\\nfifth stage of cognitive development, known as the postformal stage (Basseches, 1984; Commons & Bresette,\\n2006; Sinnott, 1998). In postformal thinking, decisions are made based on situations and circumstances, and\\nlogic is integrated with emotion as adults develop principles that depend on contexts. One way that we can see\\nthe difference between an adult in postformal thought and an adolescent in formal operations is in terms of\\nhow they handle emotionally charged issues.\\nIt seems that once we reach adulthood our problem solving abilities change: As we attempt to solve problems,\\nwe tend to think more deeply about many areas of our lives, such as relationships, work, and politics\\n(Labouvie-Vief & Diehl, 1999). Because of this, postformal thinkers are able to draw on past experiences to help\\nthem solve new problems. Problem-solving strategies using postformal thought vary, depending on the\\nsituation. What does this mean? Adults can recognize, for example, that what seems to be an ideal solution to a\\nproblem at work involving a disagreement with a colleague may not be the best solution to a disagreement with\\na significant other.\\nNeuroconstructivism\\nThe genetic environmental correlation you’ve learned about concerning the bidirectional influence of genes and the\\nenvironment has been explored in more recent theories (Newcombe, 2011). One such theory, neuroconstructivism,\\nsuggests that neural brain development influences cognitive development. Experiences that a child encounters can\\nimpact or change the way that neural pathways develop in response to the environment. An individual’s behavior is\\nbased on how one understands the world. There is interaction between neural and cognitive networks at and\\nbetween each level, consisting of these:\\n• genes\\n• neurons\\n• brain\\n• body\\n• social environment\\nThese interactions shape mental representations in the brain and are dependent on context that individuals actively\\nexplore throughout their lifetimes (Westermann, Mareschal, Johnson, Sirois, Spratling, & Thomas, 2007).\\nAn example of this would be a child who may be genetically predisposed to a difficult temperament. They may have\\nparents who provide a social environment in which they are encouraged to express themselves in an optimal\\nmanner. The child\\'s brain would form neural connections enhanced by that environment, thus influencing the brain.\\nThe brain gives information to the body about how it will experience the environment. Thus, neural and cognitive\\nnetworks work together to influence genes (i.e., attenuating temperament), body (i.e., may be less prone to high\\nblood pressure), and social environment (i.e., may seek people who are similar to them).\\nCONNECT THE CONCEPTS\\n290 9 • Lifespan Development\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nnewborn’s response to anything that touches their cheek: When you stroke a baby’s cheek, the baby naturally\\nturns the head in that direction and begins to suck. The sucking reflex is the automatic, unlearned, sucking\\nmotions that infants do with their mouths. Several other interesting newborn reflexes can be observed. For\\ninstance, if you put your finger into a newborn’s hand, you will witness the grasping reflex, in which a baby\\nautomatically grasps anything that touches the palms. The Moro reflex is the newborn’s response to the\\nsensation of falling. The baby spreads the arms, pulls them back in, and then (usually) cries.

Newborn infants’ sensory abilities are significant, but their\\nsenses are not yet fully developed. Many of a newborn’s innate preferences facilitate interaction with\\ncaregivers and other humans. Although vision is their least developed sense, newborns already show a\\npreference for faces. Babies who are just a few days old also prefer human voices, they will listen to voices\\nlonger than sounds that do not involve speech (Vouloumanos & Werker, 2004), and they seem to prefer their\\nmother’s voice over a stranger’s voice (Mills & Melhuish, 1974). In an interesting experiment, 3-week-old\\nbabies were given pacifiers that played a recording of the infant’s mother’s voice and of a stranger’s voice.\\nWhen the infants heard their mother’s voice, they sucked more strongly at the pacifier (Mills & Melhuish,\\n1974). Newborns also have a strong sense of smell. For instance, newborn babies can distinguish the smell of\\ntheir own mother from that of others. In a study by MacFarlane (1978), 1-week-old babies who were being\\nbreastfed were placed between two gauze pads. One gauze pad was from the bra of a nursing mother who was a\\nstranger, and the other gauze pad was from the bra of the infant’s own mother. More than two-thirds of the\\nweek-old babies turned toward the gauze pad with their mother’s scent.\\nPhysical Development\\nIn infancy, toddlerhood, and early childhood, the body’s physical development is rapid (Figure 9.10). On\\naverage, newborns weigh between 5 and 10 pounds, and a newborn’s weight typically doubles in six months\\nand triples in one year. By 2 years old the weight will have quadrupled, so we can expect that a 2 year old\\nshould weigh between 20 and 40 pounds. The average length of a newborn is 19.5 inches, increasing to 29.5\\ninches by 12 months and 34.4 inches by 2 years old (WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study Group, 2006).\\nFIGURE 9.10 Children experience rapid physical changes through infancy and early childhood.

Growth slows between 4 and 6 years old: During this time children gain 5–7 pounds and grow about 2–3\\ninches per year. Once females reach 8–9 years old, their growth rate outpaces that of males due to a pubertal\\ngrowth spurt. This growth spurt continues until around 12 years old, coinciding with the start of the menstrual\\n9.3 • Stages of Development 297\\ncycle. By 10 years old, the average female weighs 88 pounds, and the average male weighs 85 pounds.\\nIt was previously believed that we are born with all of the brain cells we will ever have. More recent research\\nsuggests that neurogenesis (the formation of neurons) can continue through adulthood. However, the vast\\nmajority of neural connections and pathways occur during the first few years of a child’s life (National Institute\\nof Neurological Disorders and Stroke, 2019). This period of rapid neural growth is called blooming. Neural\\npathways continue to develop through puberty. The blooming period of neural growth is then followed by a\\nperiod of pruning, where neural connections are reduced. It is thought that pruning causes the brain to\\nfunction more efficiently, allowing for mastery of more complex skills (Hutchinson, 2011). Blooming occurs\\nduring the first few years of life, and pruning continues through childhood and into adolescence in various\\nareas of the brain.\\nThe size of our brains increases rapidly. For example, the brain of a 2-year-old is 55% of its adult size, and by 6\\nyears old the brain is about 90% of its adult size (Tanner, 1978). During early childhood (ages 3–6), the frontal\\nlobes grow rapidly. Recalling our discussion of the 4 lobes of the brain earlier in this book, the frontal lobes are\\nassociated with planning, reasoning, memory, and impulse control. Therefore, by the time children reach\\nschool age, they are developmentally capable of controlling their attention and behavior. Through the\\nelementary school years, the frontal, temporal, occipital, and parietal lobes all grow in size. The brain growth\\nspurts experienced in childhood tend to follow Piaget’s sequence of cognitive development, so that significant\\nchanges in neural functioning account for cognitive advances (Kolb & Whishaw, 2009; Overman, Bachevalier,\\nTurner, & Peuster, 1992).\\nMotor development occurs in an orderly sequence as infants move from reflexive reactions (e.g., sucking and\\nrooting) to more advanced motor functioning. For instance, babies first learn to hold their heads up, then to sit\\nwith assistance, and then to sit unassisted, followed later by crawling and then walking.\\nMotor skills refer to our ability to move our bodies and manipulate objects. Fine motor skills focus on the\\nmuscles in our fingers, toes, and eyes, and enable coordination of small actions (e.g., grasping a toy, writing\\nwith a pencil, and using a spoon). Gross motor skills focus on large muscle groups that control our arms and\\nlegs and involve larger movements (e.g., balancing, running, and jumping).\\nAs motor skills develop, there are certain developmental milestones that young children should achieve (Table\\n9.4). For each milestone there is an average age, as well as a range of ages in which the milestone should be\\nreached. An example of a developmental milestone is sitting. On average, most babies sit alone at 7 months\\nold. Sitting involves both coordination and muscle strength, and 90% of babies achieve this milestone between\\n5 and 9 months old. In another example, babies on average are able to hold up their head at 6 weeks old, and\\n90% of babies achieve this between 3 weeks and 4 months old. If a baby is not holding up their head by 4\\nmonths old, they are showing a delay. If the child is displaying delays on several milestones, that is reason for\\nconcern, and the parent or caregiver should discuss this with the child’s pediatrician. Some developmental\\ndelays can be identified and addressed through early intervention.\\nDevelopmental Milestones, Ages 2–5 Years\\nAge\\n(years) Physical Personal/Social Language Cognitive\\n2\\nKicks a ball;\\nwalks up and\\ndown stairs\\nPlays alongside other\\nchildren; copies adults\\nPoints to objects when\\nnamed; puts 2–4 words\\ntogether in a sentence\\nSorts shapes and colors;\\nfollows 2-step instructions\\nTABLE 9.4\\n298 9 • Lifespan Development\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nAge\\n(years) Physical Personal/Social Language Cognitive\\n3\\nClimbs and\\nruns; pedals\\ntricycle\\nTakes turns; expresses\\nmany emotions;\\ndresses self\\nNames familiar things; uses\\npronouns\\nPlays make believe; works\\ntoys with parts (levers,\\nhandles)\\n4 Catches balls;\\nuses scissors\\nPrefers social play to\\nsolo play; knows likes\\nand interests\\nKnows songs and rhymes by\\nmemory\\nNames colors and numbers;\\nbegins writing letters\\n5\\nHops and\\nswings; uses\\nfork and spoon\\nDistinguishes real from\\npretend; likes to please\\nfriends\\nSpeaks clearly; uses full\\nsentences\\nCounts to 10 or higher;\\nprints some letters and\\ncopies basic shapes\\nTABLE 9.4\\nCognitive Development\\nIn addition to rapid physical growth, young children also exhibit significant development of their cognitive\\nabilities. Piaget thought that children’s ability to understand objects—such as learning that a rattle makes a\\nnoise when shaken—was a cognitive skill that develops slowly as a child matures and interacts with the\\nenvironment. Today, developmental psychologists think Piaget was incorrect. Researchers have found that\\neven very young children understand objects and how they work long before they have experience with those\\nobjects (Baillargeon, 1987; Baillargeon, Li, Gertner, & Wu, 2011). For example, children as young as 3 months\\nold demonstrated knowledge of the properties of objects that they had only viewed and did not have prior\\nexperience with them. In one study, 3-month-old infants were shown a truck rolling down a track and behind a\\nscreen. The box, which appeared solid but was actually hollow, was placed next to the track. The truck rolled\\npast the box as would be expected. Then the box was placed on the track to block the path of the truck. When\\nthe truck was rolled down the track this time, it continued unimpeded. The infants spent significantly more\\ntime looking at this impossible event (Figure 9.11). Baillargeon (1987) concluded that they knew solid objects\\ncannot pass through each other. Baillargeon’s findings suggest that very young children have an understanding\\nof objects and how they work, which Piaget (1954) would have said is beyond their cognitive abilities due to\\ntheir limited experiences in the world.\\nFIGURE 9.11 In Baillargeon’s study, infants observed a truck (a) roll down an unobstructed track, (b) roll down an\\nunobstructed track with an obstruction (box) beside it, and (c) roll down and pass through what appeared to be an\\nobstruction.\\nJust as there are physical milestones that we expect children to reach, there are also cognitive milestones. It is\\nhelpful to be aware of these milestones as children gain new abilities to think, problem solve, and\\ncommunicate. For example, infants shake their head “no” around 6–9 months, and they respond to verbal\\nrequests to do things like “wave bye-bye” or “blow a kiss” around 9–12 months. Remember Piaget’s ideas\\nabout object permanence? We can expect children to grasp the concept that objects continue to exist even\\nwhen they are not in sight by around 8 months old. Because toddlers (i.e., 12–24 months old) have mastered\\n9.3 • Stages of Development 299\\nobject permanence, they enjoy games like hide and seek, and they realize that when someone leaves the room\\nthey will come back (Loop, 2013). Toddlers also point to pictures in books and look in appropriate places when\\nyou ask them to find objects.\\nPreschool-age children (i.e., 3–5 years old) also make steady progress in cognitive development. Not only can\\nthey count, name colors, and tell you their name and age, but they can also make some decisions on their own,\\nsuch as choosing an outfit to wear. Preschool-age children understand basic time concepts and sequencing\\n(e.g., before and after), and they can predict what will happen next in a story. They also begin to enjoy the use\\nof humor in stories. Because they can think symbolically, they enjoy pretend play and inventing elaborate\\ncharacters and scenarios. One of the most common examples of their cognitive growth is their blossoming\\ncuriosity. Preschool-age children love to ask “Why?”\\nAn important cognitive change occurs in children this age. Recall that Piaget described 2–3 year olds as\\negocentric, meaning that they do not have an awareness of others’ points of view. Between 3 and 5 years old,\\nchildren come to understand that people have thoughts, feelings, and beliefs that are different from their own.\\nThis is known as theory-of-mind (TOM). Children can use this skill to tease others, persuade their parents to\\npurchase a candy bar, or understand why a sibling might be angry. When children develop TOM, they can\\nrecognize that others have false beliefs (Dennett, 1987; Callaghan et al., 2005).\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nFalse-belief tasks are useful in determining a child’s acquisition of theory-of-mind (TOM). Take a look at this\\nvideo clip that shows a false belief task involving a box of crayons (http://openstax.org/l/crayons) to learn more.\\nCognitive skills continue to expand in middle and late childhood (6–11 years old). Thought processes become\\nmore logical and organized when dealing with concrete information (Figure 9.12). Children at this age\\nunderstand concepts such as the past, present, and future, giving them the ability to plan and work toward\\ngoals. Additionally, they can process complex ideas such as addition and subtraction and cause-and-effect\\nrelationships. However, children’s attention spans tend to be very limited until they are around 11 years old.\\nAfter that point, it begins to improve through adulthood.\\nFIGURE 9.12 Because they understand luck and fairness, children in middle and late childhood (6–11 years old)\\nare able to follow rules for games. (credit: Edwin Martinez)\\nOne well-researched aspect of cognitive development is language acquisition. As mentioned earlier, the order\\nin which children learn language structures is consistent across children and cultures (Hatch, 1983). You’ve\\nalso learned that some psychological researchers have proposed that children possess a biological\\npredisposition for language acquisition.\\nStarting before birth, babies begin to develop language and communication skills. At birth, babies apparently\\nrecognize their mother’s voice and can discriminate between the language(s) spoken by their mothers and\\nforeign languages, and they show preferences for faces that are moving in synchrony with audible language\\n(Blossom & Morgan, 2006; Pickens, 1994; Spelke & Cortelyou, 1981).\\nChildren communicate information through gesturing long before they speak, and there is some evidence that\\n300 9 • Lifespan Development\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\ngesture usage predicts subsequent language development (Iverson & Goldin-Meadow, 2005). In terms of\\nproducing spoken language, babies begin to coo almost immediately. Cooing is a one-syllable combination of a\\nconsonant and a vowel sound (e.g., coo or ba). Interestingly, babies replicate sounds from their own languages.\\nA baby whose parents speak French will coo in a different tone than a baby whose parents speak Spanish or\\nUrdu. After cooing, the baby starts to babble. Babbling begins with repeating a syllable, such as ma-ma, da-da,\\nor ba-ba. When babies are about 12 months old, we expect them to say their first word for meaning, and to\\nstart combining words for meaning at about 18 months.\\nAt about 2 years old, a toddler uses between 50 and 200 words; by 3 years old they have a vocabulary of up to\\n1,000 words and can speak in sentences. During the early childhood years, children\\'s vocabulary increases at a\\nrapid pace. This is sometimes referred to as the “vocabulary spurt” and has been claimed to involve an\\nexpansion in vocabulary at a rate of 10–20 new words per week. Recent research may indicate that while some\\nchildren experience these spurts, it is far from universal (as discussed in Ganger & Brent, 2004). It has been\\nestimated that, 5 year olds understand about 6,000 words, speak 2,000 words, and can define words and\\nquestion their meanings. They can rhyme and name the days of the week. Seven year olds speak fluently and\\nuse slang and clichés (Stork & Widdowson, 1974).\\nWhat accounts for such dramatic language learning by children? Behaviorist B. F. Skinner thought that we\\nlearn language in response to reinforcement or feedback, such as through parental approval or through being\\nunderstood. For example, when a two-year-old child asks for juice, he might say, “me juice,” to which his\\nmother might respond by giving him a cup of apple juice. Noam Chomsky (1957) criticized Skinner’s theory\\nand proposed that we are all born with an innate capacity to learn language. Chomsky called this mechanism a\\nlanguage acquisition device (LAD). Who is correct? Both Chomsky and Skinner are right. Remember that we\\nare a product of both nature and nurture. Researchers now believe that language acquisition is partially inborn\\nand partially learned through our interactions with our linguistic environment (Gleitman & Newport, 1995;\\nStork & Widdowson, 1974).\\nAttachment\\nPsychosocial development occurs as children form relationships, interact with others, and understand and\\nmanage their feelings. In social and emotional development, forming healthy attachments is very important\\nand is the major social milestone of infancy. Attachment is a long-standing connection or bond with others.\\nDevelopmental psychologists are interested in how infants reach this milestone. They ask such questions as:\\nHow do parent and infant attachment bonds form? How does neglect affect these bonds? What accounts for\\nchildren’s attachment differences?\\nResearchers Harry Harlow, John Bowlby, and Mary Ainsworth conducted studies designed to answer these\\nquestions. In the 1950s, Harlow conducted a series of experiments on monkeys. He separated newborn\\nmonkeys from their mothers. Each monkey was presented with two surrogate mothers. One surrogate monkey\\nwas made out of wire mesh, and she could dispense milk. The other monkey was softer and made from cloth:\\nThis monkey did not dispense milk. Research shows that the monkeys preferred the soft, cuddly cloth monkey,\\neven though she did not provide any nourishment. The baby monkeys spent their time clinging to the cloth\\nmonkey and only went to the wire monkey when they needed to be fed. Prior to this study, the medical and\\nscientific communities generally thought that babies become attached to the people who provide their\\nnourishment. However, Harlow (1958) concluded that there was more to the mother-child bond than\\nnourishment. Feelings of comfort and security are the critical components to maternal-infant bonding, which\\nleads to healthy psychosocial development.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nHarlow’s studies of monkeys were performed before modern ethics guidelines were in place, and today his\\nexperiments are widely considered to be unethical and even cruel.

Its founding resulted from disagreements between members of the scientific and clinical branches of psychology within the APA. The APS publishes five research journals and engages in education and advocacy with funding agencies. A significant proportion of its members are international, although the majority is located in the United States. Other organizations provide networking and collaboration opportunities for professionals of several ethnic or racial groups working in psychology, such as the National Latina/o Psychological Association (NLPA), the Asian American Psychological Association (AAPA), the Association of Black Psychologists (ABPsi), and the Society of Indian Psychologists (SIP). Most of these groups are also dedicated to studying psychological and social issues within their specific communities.

Biopsychology and Evolutionary Psychology As the name suggests, biopsychology explores how our biology influences our behavior. While biological psychology is a broad field, many biological psychologists want to understand how the structure and function of the nervous system is related to behavior (Figure 1.10). As such, they often combine the research strategies of both psychologists and physiologists to accomplish this goal (as discussed in Carlson, 2013). FIGURE 1.10 Biological psychologists study how the structure and function of the nervous system generate behavior. The research interests of biological psychologists span a number of domains, including but not limited to, 1.3 • Contemporary Psychology 19 sensory and motor systems, sleep, drug use and abuse, ingestive behavior, learning and memory, personality and personality disorders, and mental health. 2.4 • Clinical Psychology and Counseling 3.5 • Developmental Psychology, Social Psychology, and Social Cognition 4.6 • Cognitive Neuroscience 5.7 • Neuropsychology 6.8 • Psychophysiology 7.9 • Neuroendocrinology, Neuroimmunology, Neurobiology of Learning and Memory 8.0 • Behavioral Genetics 9.2 • Human Development and Aging Biological psychology is an interdisciplinary field that draws on knowledge from a wide range of disciplines, including biology, physiology, neurology, psychiatry, sociology, anthropology, linguistics, psychology, neuroscience, computer science, mathematics, statistics, philosophy, history, law, economics, art, music, literature, dance, theater, film, literature, television, radio, video games, etc. In addition to the above disciplines, there are many subfields within biological psychology that focus on a particular aspect of biological processes. For example, the field of neurobiology is concerned with the study of brain and nervous system function and structure, as well as the molecular and cellular processes that underlie these processes. Neuropsychologists study the effects of disease and injury on brain function, while neuroscientists study how the brain processes information and how it changes over time in response to experience. Psychobiologists study the biological basis of human behavior and personality. Behavioral genetics focuses on the genetic basis of behavior in humans and other animals. Finally, human development and aging studies the physical and psychological development of humans from conception to old age. Evolutionary psychology (also known as cultural psychology) is the branch of psychological science that investigates how people acquire and use knowledge and skills, how they learn from their environment, how they interact with other people and with nature, what motivates people to behave in certain ways, what drives them to act in particular ways, why people behave the way they do and why they behave differently from person to person and from one culture to another. It is also a subfield of evolutionary biology, which studies how organisms adapt to their environments in order to survive and reproduce. Although evolutionary psychology has its roots in evolutionary biology and genetics, it is distinct from that field in that it does not focus solely on biological processes, but also on social and cultural processes. As a result, evolutionary psychologists are interested in how culture influences human behaviors', 'references': '{\"sections\": [\"Lifespan Development/Stages of Development\", \"Introduction to Psychology\"], \"pages\": [\"300\", \"311\", \"33\"]}'}\n",

Indeed, scientists have found genetic linkages to a\\nnumber of behavioral characteristics, ranging from basic personality traits to sexual orientation to spirituality\\n(for examples, see Mustanski et al., 2005; Comings, Gonzales, Saucier, Johnson, & MacMurray, 2000). Genes are\\nalso associated with temperament and a number of psychological disorders, such as depression and\\nschizophrenia. So while it is true that genes provide the biological blueprints for our cells, tissues, organs, and\\nbody, they also have a significant impact on our experiences and our behaviors.\\nLet’s look at the following findings regarding schizophrenia in light of our three views of gene-environment\\ninteractions. Which view do you think best explains this evidence?\\nIn a 2004 study by Tienari and colleagues, adoptees whose biological mothers had schizophrenia and who had\\nbeen raised in a disturbed family environment were much more likely to develop schizophrenia or another\\npsychotic disorder than were any of the other groups in the study:\\n• Of adoptees whose biological mothers had schizophrenia (high genetic risk) and who were raised in\\ndisturbed family environments, 36.8% were likely to develop schizophrenia.\\n• Of adoptees whose biological mothers had schizophrenia (high genetic risk) and who were raised in\\nhealthy family environments, 5.8% were likely to develop schizophrenia.\\n• Of adoptees with a low genetic risk (whose mothers did not have schizophrenia) and who were raised in\\ndisturbed family environments, 5.3% were likely to develop schizophrenia.\\n• Of adoptees with a low genetic risk (whose mothers did not have schizophrenia) and who were raised in\\nhealthy family environments, 4.8% were likely to develop schizophrenia.\\nThe study shows that adoptees with high genetic risk were most likely to develop schizophrenia if they were\\nraised in disturbed home environments. This research lends credibility to the notion that both genetic\\nvulnerability and environmental stress are necessary for schizophrenia to develop, and that genes alone do not\\ntell the full tale.\\n3.2 Cells of the Nervous System\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Identify the basic parts of a neuron\\n• Describe how neurons communicate with each other\\n• Explain how drugs act as agonists or antagonists for a given neurotransmitter system\\nPsychologists striving to understand the human mind may study the nervous system. Learning how the body's\\ncells and organs function can help us understand the biological basis of human psychology. The nervous\\nsystem is composed of two basic cell types: glial cells (also known as glia) and neurons. Glial cells are\\ntraditionally thought to play a supportive role to neurons, both physically and metabolically. Glial cells provide\\nscaffolding on which the nervous system is built, help neurons line up closely with each other to allow\\nneuronal communication, provide insulation to neurons, transport nutrients and waste products, and mediate\\nimmune responses. For years, researchers believed that there were many more glial cells than neurons;\\nhowever, more recent work from Suzanna Herculano-Houzel's laboratory has called this long-standing\\nassumption into question and has provided important evidence that there may be a nearly 1:1 ratio of glia cells\\nto neurons. This is important because it suggests that human brains are more similar to other primate brains\\nthan previously thought (Azevedo et al, 2009; Herculano-Houzel, 2012; Herculano-Houzel, 2009). Neurons, on\\n78 3 • Biopsychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nthe other hand, serve as interconnected information processors that are essential for all of the tasks of the\\nnervous system. This section briefly describes the structure and function of neurons.\\nNeuron Structure\\nNeurons are the central building blocks of the nervous system, 100 billion strong at birth. Like all cells,\\nneurons consist of several different parts, each serving a specialized function (Figure 3.8). A neuron’s outer\\nsurface is made up of a semipermeable membrane. This membrane allows smaller molecules and molecules\\nwithout an electrical charge to pass through it, while stopping larger or highly charged molecules.\\nFIGURE 3.8 This illustration shows a prototypical neuron, which is being myelinated by a glial cell.\\nThe nucleus of the neuron is located in the soma, or cell body. The soma has branching extensions known as\\ndendrites. The neuron is a small information processor, and dendrites serve as input sites where signals are\\nreceived from other neurons. These signals are transmitted electrically across the soma and down a major\\nextension from the soma known as the axon, which ends at multiple terminal buttons. The terminal buttons\\ncontain synaptic vesicles that house neurotransmitters, the chemical messengers of the nervous system.\\nAxons range in length from a fraction of an inch to several feet. In some axons, glial cells form a fatty substance\\nknown as the myelin sheath, which coats the axon and acts as an insulator, increasing the speed at which the\\nsignal travels. The myelin sheath is not continuous and there are small gaps that occur down the length of the\\naxon. These gaps in the myelin sheath are known as the Nodes of Ranvier. The myelin sheath is crucial for the\\nnormal operation of the neurons within the nervous system: the loss of the insulation it provides can be\\ndetrimental to normal function. To understand how this works, let’s consider an example. PKU, a genetic\\ndisorder discussed earlier, causes a reduction in myelin and abnormalities in white matter cortical and\\nsubcortical structures. The disorder is associated with a variety of issues including severe cognitive deficits,\\nexaggerated reflexes, and seizures (Anderson & Leuzzi, 2010; Huttenlocher, 2000). Another disorder, multiple\\nsclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disorder, involves a large-scale loss of the myelin sheath on axons throughout\\nthe nervous system. The resulting interference in the electrical signal prevents the quick transmittal of\\ninformation by neurons and can lead to a number of symptoms, such as dizziness, fatigue, loss of motor\\ncontrol, and sexual dysfunction. While some treatments may help to modify the course of the disease and\\nmanage certain symptoms, there is currently no known cure for multiple sclerosis.\\nIn healthy individuals, the neuronal signal moves rapidly down the axon to the terminal buttons, where\\nsynaptic vesicles release neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft (Figure 3.9). The synaptic cleft is a very\\nsmall space between two neurons and is an important site where communication between neurons occurs.\\nOnce neurotransmitters are released into the synaptic cleft, they travel across it and bind with corresponding\\nreceptors on the dendrite of an adjacent neuron. Receptors, proteins on the cell surface where\\nneurotransmitters attach, vary in shape, with different shapes “matching” different neurotransmitters.\\nHow does a neurotransmitter “know” which receptor to bind to? The neurotransmitter and the receptor have\\n3.2 • Cells of the Nervous System 79\\nwhat is referred to as a lock-and-key relationship—specific neurotransmitters fit specific receptors similar to\\nhow a key fits a lock. The neurotransmitter binds to any receptor that it fits.\\nFIGURE 3.9 (a) The synaptic cleft is the space between the terminal button of one neuron and the dendrite of\\nanother neuron. (b) In this pseudo-colored image from a scanning electron microscope, a terminal button (green)\\nhas been opened to reveal the synaptic vesicles (orange and blue) inside. Each vesicle contains about 10,000\\nneurotransmitter molecules. (credit b: modification of work by Tina Carvalho, NIH-NIGMS; scale-bar data from Matt\\nRussell)\\nNeuronal Communication\\nNow that we have learned about the basic structures of the neuron and the role that these structures play in\\nneuronal communication, let’s take a closer look at the signal itself—how it moves through the neuron and then\\njumps to the next neuron, where the process is repeated.\\nWe begin at the neuronal membrane. The neuron exists in a fluid environment—it is surrounded by\\nextracellular fluid and contains intracellular fluid (i.e., cytoplasm). The neuronal membrane keeps these two\\nfluids separate—a critical role because the electrical signal that passes through the neuron depends on the\\nintra- and extracellular fluids being electrically different. This difference in charge across the membrane,\\ncalled the membrane potential, provides energy for the signal.\\nThe electrical charge of the fluids is caused by charged molecules (ions) dissolved in the fluid. The\\nsemipermeable nature of the neuronal membrane somewhat restricts the movement of these charged\\nmolecules, and, as a result, some of the charged particles tend to become more concentrated either inside or\\noutside the cell.\\nBetween signals, the neuron membrane’s potential is held in a state of readiness, called the resting potential.\\nLike a rubber band stretched out and waiting to spring into action, ions line up on either side of the cell\\nmembrane, ready to rush across the membrane when the neuron goes active and the membrane opens its\\ngates. Ions in high-concentration areas are ready to move to low-concentration areas, and positive ions are\\nready to move to areas with a negative charge.\\nIn the resting state, sodium (Na+) is at higher concentrations outside the cell, so it will tend to move into the\\ncell. Potassium (K+), on the other hand, is more concentrated inside the cell, and will tend to move out of the\\ncell (Figure 3.10). In addition, the inside of the cell is slightly negatively charged compared to the outside, due\\nto the activity of the sodium-potassium pump. This pump actively transports three sodium ions out of the cell\\nfor every two potassium ions in, creating a net negative charge inside the cell. This provides an additional\\nforce on sodium, causing it to move into the cell.\\n80 3 • Biopsychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nFIGURE 3.10 At resting potential, Na+ (blue pentagons) is more highly concentrated outside the cell in the\\nextracellular fluid (shown in blue), whereas K+ (purple squares) is more highly concentrated near the membrane in\\nthe cytoplasm or intracellular fluid. Other molecules, such as chloride ions (yellow circles) and negatively charged\\nproteins (brown squares), help contribute to a positive net charge in the extracellular fluid and a negative net charge\\nin the intracellular fluid.\\nFrom this resting potential state, the neuron receives a signal and its state changes abruptly (Figure 3.11).\\nWhen a neuron receives signals at the dendrites—due to neurotransmitters from an adjacent neuron binding\\nto its receptors—small pores, or gates, open on the neuronal membrane, allowing Na+ ions, propelled by both\\ncharge and concentration differences, to move into the cell. With this influx of positive ions, the internal\\ncharge of the cell becomes more positive. If that charge reaches a certain level, called the threshold of\\nexcitation, the neuron becomes active and the action potential begins.\\nMany additional pores open, causing a massive influx of Na+ ions and a huge positive spike in the membrane\\npotential, the peak action potential. At the peak of the spike, the sodium gates close and the potassium gates\\nopen. As positively charged potassium ions leave, the cell quickly begins repolarization. At first, it\\nhyperpolarizes, becoming slightly more negative than the resting potential, and then it levels off, returning to\\nthe resting potential.\\nFIGURE 3.11 During the action potential, the electrical charge across the membrane changes dramatically.\\nThis positive spike constitutes the action potential: the electrical signal that typically moves from the cell body\\ndown the axon to the axon terminals. The electrical signal moves down the axon with the impulses jumping in\\na leapfrog fashion between the Nodes of Ranvier. The Nodes of Ranvier are natural gaps in the myelin sheath.\\nAt each point, some of the sodium ions that enter the cell diffuse to the next section of the axon, raising the\\ncharge past the threshold of excitation and triggering a new influx of sodium ions. The action potential moves\\n3.2 • Cells of the Nervous System 81\\nall the way down the axon in this fashion until reaching the terminal buttons.\\nThe action potential is an all-or-none phenomenon. In simple terms, this means that an incoming signal from\\nanother neuron is either sufficient or insufficient to reach the threshold of excitation. There is no in-between,\\nand there is no turning off an action potential once it starts. Think of it like sending an email or a text message.\\nYou can think about sending it all you want, but the message is not sent until you hit the send button.\\nFurthermore, once you send the message, there is no stopping it.\\nBecause it is all or none, the action potential is recreated, or propagated, at its full strength at every point along\\nthe axon. Much like the lit fuse of a firecracker, it does not fade away as it travels down the axon. It is this all-or-\\nnone property that explains the fact that your brain perceives an injury to a distant body part like your toe as\\nequally painful as one to your nose.\\nAs noted earlier, when the action potential arrives at the terminal button, the synaptic vesicles release their\\nneurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitters travel across the synapse and bind to\\nreceptors on the dendrites of the adjacent neuron, and the process repeats itself in the new neuron (assuming\\nthe signal is sufficiently strong to trigger an action potential). Once the signal is delivered, excess\\nneurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft drift away, are broken down into inactive fragments, or are reabsorbed\\nin a process known as reuptake. Reuptake involves the neurotransmitter being pumped back into the neuron\\nthat released it, in order to clear the synapse (Figure 3.12). Clearing the synapse serves both to provide a clear\\n“on” and “off” state between signals and to regulate the production of neurotransmitter (full synaptic vesicles\\nprovide signals that no additional neurotransmitters need to be produced).\\nFIGURE 3.12 Reuptake involves moving a neurotransmitter from the synapse back into the axon terminal from\\nwhich it was released.\\nNeuronal communication is often referred to as an electrochemical event. The movement of the action\\npotential down the length of the axon is an electrical event, and movement of the neurotransmitter across the\\nsynaptic space represents the chemical portion of the process. However, there are some specialized\\nconnections between neurons that are entirely electrical. In such cases, the neurons are said to communicate\\nvia an electrical synapse. In these cases, two neurons physically connect to one another via gap junctions,\\nwhich allows the current from one cell to pass into the next. There are far fewer electrical synapses in the\\nbrain, but those that do exist are much faster than the chemical synapses that have been described above\\n(Connors & Long, 2004).\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nWatch this video about neuronal communication (http://openstax.org/l/neuroncom) to learn more.\\n82 3 • Biopsychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nNeurotransmitters and Drugs\\nThere are several different types of neurotransmitters released by different neurons, and we can speak in\\nbroad terms about the kinds of functions associated with different neurotransmitters (Table 3.1). Much of what\\npsychologists know about the functions of neurotransmitters comes from research on the effects of drugs in\\npsychological disorders. Psychologists who take a biological perspective and focus on the physiological\\ncauses of behavior assert that psychological disorders like depression and schizophrenia are associated with\\nimbalances in one or more neurotransmitter systems. In this perspective, psychotropic medications can help\\nimprove the symptoms associated with these disorders. Psychotropic medications are drugs that treat\\npsychiatric symptoms by restoring neurotransmitter balance.\\nMajor Neurotransmitters and How They Affect Behavior\\nNeurotransmitter Involved in Potential Effect on Behavior\\nAcetylcholine Muscle action, memory Increased arousal, enhanced cognition\\nBeta-endorphin Pain, pleasure Decreased anxiety, decreased tension\\nDopamine Mood, sleep, learning Increased pleasure, suppressed appetite\\nGamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) Brain function, sleep Decreased anxiety, decreased tension\\nGlutamate Memory, learning Increased learning, enhanced memory\\nNorepinephrine Heart, intestines, alertness Increased arousal, suppressed appetite\\nSerotonin Mood, sleep Modulated mood, suppressed appetite\\nTABLE 3.1\\nPsychoactive drugs can act as agonists or antagonists for a given neurotransmitter system. Agonists are\\nchemicals that mimic a neurotransmitter at the receptor site. An antagonist, on the other hand, blocks or\\nimpedes the normal activity of a neurotransmitter at the receptor. Agonists and antagonists represent drugs\\nthat are prescribed to correct the specific neurotransmitter imbalances underlying a person’s condition. For\\nexample, Parkinson's disease, a progressive nervous system disorder, is associated with low levels of\\ndopamine. Therefore, a common treatment strategy for Parkinson's disease involves using dopamine agonists,\\nwhich mimic the effects of dopamine by binding to dopamine receptors.\\nCertain symptoms of schizophrenia are associated with overactive dopamine neurotransmission. The\\nantipsychotics used to treat these symptoms are antagonists for dopamine—they block dopamine’s effects by\\nbinding its receptors without activating them. Thus, they prevent dopamine released by one neuron from\\nsignaling information to adjacent neurons.\\nIn contrast to agonists and antagonists, which both operate by binding to receptor sites, reuptake inhibitors\\nprevent unused neurotransmitters from being transported back to the neuron. This allows neurotransmitters\\nto remain active in the synaptic cleft for longer durations, increasing their effectiveness. Depression, which\\nhas been consistently linked with reduced serotonin levels, is commonly treated with selective serotonin\\nreuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). By preventing reuptake, SSRIs strengthen the effect of serotonin, giving it more\\ntime to interact with serotonin receptors on dendrites. Common SSRIs on the market today include Prozac,\\nPaxil, and Zoloft. The drug LSD is structurally very similar to serotonin, and it affects the same neurons and\\nreceptors as serotonin. Psychotropic drugs are not instant solutions for people suffering from psychological\\ndisorders. Often, an individual must take a drug for several weeks before seeing improvement, and many\\n3.2 • Cells of the Nervous System 83\\npsychoactive drugs have significant negative side effects. Furthermore, individuals vary dramatically in how\\nthey respond to the drugs. To improve chances for success, it is not uncommon for people receiving\\npharmacotherapy to undergo psychological and/or behavioral therapies as well. Some research suggests that\\ncombining drug therapy with other forms of therapy tends to be more effective than any one treatment alone\\n(for one such example, see March et al., 2007).\\n3.3 Parts of the Nervous System\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Describe the difference between the central and peripheral nervous systems\\n• Explain the difference between the somatic and autonomic nervous systems\\n• Differentiate between the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system\\nThe nervous system can be divided into two major subdivisions: the central nervous system (CNS) and the\\nperipheral nervous system (PNS), shown in Figure 3.13. The CNS is comprised of the brain and spinal cord;\\nthe PNS connects the CNS to the rest of the body. In this section, we focus on the peripheral nervous system;\\nlater, we look at the brain and spinal cord.\\nFIGURE 3.13 The nervous system is divided into two major parts: (a) the Central Nervous System and (b) the\\nPeripheral Nervous System.\\nPeripheral Nervous System\\nThe peripheral nervous system is made up of thick bundles of axons, called nerves, carrying messages back\\nand forth between the CNS and the muscles, organs, and senses in the periphery of the body (i.e., everything\\noutside the CNS). The PNS has two major subdivisions: the somatic nervous system and the autonomic\\n84 3 • Biopsychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nnervous system.\\nThe somatic nervous system is associated with activities traditionally thought of as conscious or voluntary. It\\nis involved in the relay of sensory and motor information to and from the CNS; therefore, it consists of motor\\nneurons and sensory neurons. Motor neurons, carrying instructions from the CNS to the muscles, are efferent\\nfibers (efferent means “moving away from”). Sensory neurons, carrying sensory information to the CNS, are\\nafferent fibers (afferent means “moving toward”). A helpful way to remember this is that efferent = exit and\\nafferent = arrive. Each nerve is basically a bundle of neurons forming a two-way superhighway, containing\\nthousands of axons, both efferent and afferent.\\nThe autonomic nervous system controls our internal organs and glands and is generally considered to be\\noutside the realm of voluntary control. It can be further subdivided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic\\ndivisions (Figure 3.14). The sympathetic nervous system is involved in preparing the body for stress-related\\nactivities; the parasympathetic nervous system is associated with returning the body to routine, day-to-day\\noperations. The two systems have complementary functions, operating in tandem to maintain the body’s\\nhomeostasis. Homeostasis is a state of equilibrium, or balance, in which biological conditions (such as body\\ntemperature) are maintained at optimal levels.\\nFIGURE 3.14 The sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system have the opposite\\neffects on various systems.\\nThe sympathetic nervous system is activated when we are faced with stressful or high-arousal situations. The\\nactivity of this system was adaptive for our ancestors, increasing their chances of survival. Imagine, for\\nexample, that one of our early ancestors, out hunting small game, suddenly disturbs a large bear with her cubs.\\nAt that moment, the hunter's body undergoes a series of changes—a direct function of sympathetic\\nactivation—preparing them to face the threat. The pupils dilate, the heart rate and blood pressure increase, the\\nbladder relaxes, and the liver releases glucose; adrenaline surges into the bloodstream.

Different versions of a gene are called\\nalleles—sometimes alleles can be classified as dominant or recessive. A dominant allele always results in the\\ndominant phenotype. In order to exhibit a recessive phenotype, an individual must be homozygous for the\\nrecessive allele. Genes affect both physical and psychological characteristics. Ultimately, how and when a gene\\nis expressed, and what the outcome will be—in terms of both physical and psychological characteristics—is a\\nfunction of the interaction between our genes and our environments.\\n3.2 Cells of the Nervous System\\nGlia and neurons are the two cell types that make up the nervous system. While glia generally play supporting\\nroles, the communication between neurons is fundamental to all of the functions associated with the nervous\\nsystem. Neuronal communication is made possible by the neuron’s specialized structures. The soma contains\\nthe cell nucleus, and the dendrites extend from the soma in tree-like branches. The axon is another major\\nextension of the cell body; axons are often covered by a myelin sheath, which increases the speed of\\ntransmission of neural impulses. At the end of the axon are terminal buttons that contain synaptic vesicles\\nfilled with neurotransmitters.\\nNeuronal communication is an electrochemical event. The dendrites contain receptors for neurotransmitters\\nreleased by nearby neurons. If the signals received from other neurons are sufficiently strong, an action\\npotential will travel down the length of the axon to the terminal buttons, resulting in the release of\\nneurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. Action potentials operate on the all-or-none principle and involve\\n102 3 • Summary\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nthe movement of Na+ and K+ across the neuronal membrane.\\nDifferent neurotransmitters are associated with different functions. Often, psychological disorders involve\\nimbalances in a given neurotransmitter system. Therefore, psychotropic drugs are prescribed in an attempt to\\nbring the neurotransmitters back into balance. Drugs can act either as agonists or as antagonists for a given\\nneurotransmitter system.\\n3.3 Parts of the Nervous System\\nThe brain and spinal cord make up the central nervous system. The peripheral nervous system is comprised of\\nthe somatic and autonomic nervous systems. The somatic nervous system transmits sensory and motor\\nsignals to and from the central nervous system. The autonomic nervous system controls the function of our\\norgans and glands, and can be divided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions. Sympathetic\\nactivation prepares us for fight or flight, while parasympathetic activation is associated with normal\\nfunctioning under relaxed conditions.\\n3.4 The Brain and Spinal Cord\\nThe brain consists of two hemispheres, each controlling the opposite side of the body. Each hemisphere can be\\nsubdivided into different lobes: frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital. In addition to the lobes of the\\ncerebral cortex, the forebrain includes the thalamus (sensory relay) and limbic system (emotion and memory\\ncircuit). The midbrain contains the reticular formation, which is important for sleep and arousal, as well as the\\nsubstantia nigra and ventral tegmental area. These structures are important for movement, reward, and\\naddictive processes. The hindbrain contains the structures of the brainstem (medulla, pons, and midbrain),\\nwhich control automatic functions like breathing and blood pressure. The hindbrain also contains the\\ncerebellum, which helps coordinate movement and certain types of memories.\\nIndividuals with brain damage have been studied extensively to provide information about the role of different\\nareas of the brain, and recent advances in technology allow us to glean similar information by imaging brain\\nstructure and function. These techniques include CT, PET, MRI, fMRI, and EEG.\\n3.5 The Endocrine System\\nThe glands of the endocrine system secrete hormones to regulate normal body functions. The hypothalamus\\nserves as the interface between the nervous system and the endocrine system, and it controls the secretions of\\nthe pituitary. The pituitary serves as the master gland, controlling the secretions of all other glands. The\\nthyroid secretes thyroxine, which is important for basic metabolic processes and growth; the adrenal glands\\nsecrete hormones involved in the stress response; the pancreas secretes hormones that regulate blood sugar\\nlevels; and the ovaries and testes produce sex hormones that regulate sexual motivation and behavior.\\nReview Questions\\n1.

LINK T O LEARNING Watch this video about the epigenetics of twin studies (http://openstax.org/l/twinstudy) to learn more. Genes affect more than our physical characteristics. Indeed, scientists have found genetic linkages to a number of behavioral characteristics, ranging from basic personality traits to sexual orientation to spirituality (for examples, see Mustanski et al., 2005; Comings, Gonzales, Saucier, Johnson, & MacMurray, 2000). Genes are also associated with temperament and a number of psychological disorders, such as depression and schizophrenia. So while it is true that genes provide the biological blueprints for our cells, tissues, organs, and body, they also have a significant impact on our experiences and our behaviors. Let’s look at the following findings regarding schizophrenia in light of our three views of gene-environment interactions. Which view do you think best explains this evidence? In a 2004 study by Tienari and colleagues, adoptees whose biological mothers had schizophrenia and who had been raised in a disturbed family environment were much more likely to develop schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder than were any of the other groups in the study: • Of adoptees whose biological mothers had schizophrenia (high genetic risk) and who were raised in disturbed family environments, 36.8% were likely to develop schizophrenia. • Of adoptees whose biological mothers had schizophrenia (high genetic risk) and who were raised in healthy family environments, 5.8% were likely to develop schizophrenia. • Of adoptees with a low genetic risk (whose mothers did not have schizophrenia) and who were raised in disturbed family environments, 5.3% were likely to develop schizophrenia. • Of adoptees with a low genetic risk (whose mothers did not have schizophrenia) and who were raised in healthy family environments, 4.8% were likely to develop schizophrenia. The study shows that adoptees with high genetic risk were most likely to develop schizophrenia if they were raised in disturbed home environments. This is consistent with our view that the environment plays a major role in determining whether or not an individual will develop a psychological disorder. In contrast, the study suggests that if an adoptee’s biological mother had no schizophrenia, she would not be at risk for developing a psychotic disorder, even if she had raised her adoptive child in an environment of high genetic risk. In another study, researchers found that children of mothers with schizophrenia had a significantly higher risk of developing schizophrenia than did children whose mothers were not schizophrenic. They also found that the risk of schizophrenia was significantly greater for boys than for girls. These findings are consistent with our views on the role of genetics in schizophrenia. For example, we know that schizophrenia is more common in males than in females and that boys are at greater risk than girls for developing the disorder. However, these findings do not necessarily mean that genetics is the only factor that determines whether or not a child develops a mental illness. There are many other factors that may play a role, including environmental factors and biological factors, as well as both genetic and non-genetic factors. Therefore, it is important to consider all of these factors when trying to understand why some children develop mental illnesses and others don’t. Another example of how genetics and environment interact can be found in studies of twins. Researchers found that identical twins raised together were less likely than fraternal (non-identical) twins to become twin sisters or brothers. However, when the twins were separated at birth and raised apart, there was no significant difference in their likelihood of becoming twin sisters and brothers. These findings suggest that genetic factors are important, but they are not the whole story. It is also important to recognize that environmental factors can play an important role in shaping a person’s characteristics and behaviors, just as they do in other areas of life. Environmental factors include families, friends, schools, neighborhoods, etc. Just as genetics can influence our behavior, so too can our experiences and interactions with the world around us.', 'references': '{\"sections\": [\"Biopsychology/The Brain and Spinal Cord\", \"States of Consciousness/Sleep and Why We Sleep\"], \"pages\": [\"92\", \"95\", \"115\"]}'}\n",

They believed\\npersonality is largely governed by biology. The Eysencks (Eysenck, 1990, 1992; Eysenck & Eysenck, 1963)\\nviewed people as having two specific personality dimensions: extroversion/introversion and neuroticism/\\nstability.\\n380 11 • Personality\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nFIGURE 11.12 Hans and Sybil Eysenck believed that our personality traits are influenced by our genetic inheritance.\\n(credit: \"Sirswindon\"/Wikimedia Commons)\\nAccording to their theory, people high on the trait of extroversion are sociable and outgoing, and readily\\nconnect with others, whereas people high on the trait of introversion have a higher need to be alone, engage in\\nsolitary behaviors, and limit their interactions with others. In the neuroticism/stability dimension, people high\\non neuroticism tend to be anxious; they tend to have an overactive sympathetic nervous system and, even with\\nlow stress, their bodies and emotional state tend to go into a flight-or-fight reaction. In contrast, people high on\\nstability tend to need more stimulation to activate their flight-or-fight reaction and are considered more\\nemotionally stable. Based on these two dimensions, the Eysencks’ theory divides people into four quadrants.\\nThese quadrants are sometimes compared with the four temperaments described by the Greeks: melancholic,\\ncholeric, phlegmatic, and sanguine (Figure 11.13).\\n11.7 • Trait Theorists 381\\nFIGURE 11.13 The Eysencks described two factors to account for variations in our personalities: extroversion/\\nintroversion and emotional stability/instability.\\nLater, the Eysencks added a third dimension: psychoticism versus superego control (Eysenck, Eysenck &\\nBarrett, 1985). In this dimension, people who are high on psychoticism tend to be independent thinkers, cold,\\nnonconformists, impulsive, antisocial, and hostile, whereas people who are high on superego control tend to\\nhave high impulse control—they are more altruistic, empathetic, cooperative, and conventional (Eysenck,\\nEysenck & Barrett, 1985).\\nWhile Cattell’s 16 factors may be too broad, the Eysenck’s two-factor system has been criticized for being too\\nnarrow. Another personality theory, called the Five Factor Model, effectively hits a middle ground, with its five\\nfactors referred to as the Big Five personality factors. It is the most popular theory in personality psychology\\ntoday and the most accurate approximation of the basic personality dimensions (Funder, 2001). The five\\nfactors are openness to experience, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism (Figure\\n11.14). A helpful way to remember the factors is by using the mnemonic OCEAN.\\nIn the Five Factor Model, each person has each factor, but they occur along a spectrum. Openness to\\nexperience is characterized by imagination, feelings, actions, and ideas. People who score high on this factor\\ntend to be curious and have a wide range of interests. Conscientiousness is characterized by competence, self-\\ndiscipline, thoughtfulness, and achievement-striving (goal-directed behavior). People who score high on this\\nfactor are hardworking and dependable. Numerous studies have found a positive correlation between\\nconscientiousness and academic success (Akomolafe, 2013; Chamorro-Premuzic & Furnham, 2008; Conrad &\\nPatry, 2012; Noftle & Robins, 2007; Wagerman & Funder, 2007). Extroversion is characterized by sociability,\\nassertiveness, excitement-seeking, and emotional expression. People who score high on this factor are usually\\ndescribed as outgoing and warm. Not surprisingly, people who score high on both extroversion and openness\\nare more likely to participate in adventure and risky sports due to their curious and excitement-seeking nature\\n(Tok, 2011). The fourth factor is agreeableness, which is the tendency to be pleasant, cooperative, trustworthy,\\nand good-natured. People who score low on agreeableness tend to be described as rude and uncooperative, yet\\none recent study reported that men who scored low on this factor actually earned more money than men who\\nwere considered more agreeable (Judge, Livingston, & Hurst, 2012). The last of the Big Five factors is\\n382 11 • Personality\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nneuroticism, which is the tendency to experience negative emotions. People high on neuroticism tend to\\nexperience emotional instability and are characterized as angry, impulsive, and hostile. Watson and Clark\\n(1984) found that people reporting high levels of neuroticism also tend to report feeling anxious and unhappy.\\nIn contrast, people who score low in neuroticism tend to be calm and even-tempered.\\nFIGURE 11.14 In the Five Factor Model, each person has five factors, each scored on a continuum from high to low.\\nIn the center column, notice that the first letter of each factor spells the mnemonic OCEAN.\\nThe Big Five personality factors each represent a range between two extremes. In reality, most of us tend to lie\\nsomewhere midway along the continuum of each factor, rather than at polar ends. It’s important to note that\\nthe Big Five factors are relatively stable over our lifespan, with some tendency for the factors to increase or\\ndecrease slightly. Researchers have found that conscientiousness increases through young adulthood into\\nmiddle age, as we become better able to manage our personal relationships and careers (Donnellan & Lucas,\\n2008). Agreeableness also increases with age, peaking between 50 to 70 years (Terracciano, McCrae, Brant, &\\nCosta, 2005). Neuroticism and extroversion tend to decline slightly with age (Donnellan & Lucas; Terracciano\\net al.). Additionally, The Big Five factors have been shown to exist across ethnicities, cultures, and ages, and\\nmay have substantial biological and genetic components (Jang, Livesley, & Vernon, 1996; Jang et al., 2006;\\nMcCrae & Costa, 1997; Schmitt et al., 2007).\\nAnother model of personality traits is the HEXACO model. HEXACO is an acronym for six broad traits: honesty-\\nhumility, emotionality, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience (Anglim &\\nO’Connor, 2018). Table 11.6 provides a brief overview of each trait.\\n11.7 • Trait Theorists 383\\nThe HEXACO Traits\\nTrait Example Aspects of Trait\\n(H) Honesty-humility Sincerity, modesty, faithfulness\\n(E) Emotionality Sentimentality, anxiety, sensitivity\\n(X) Extraversion Sociability, talkativeness, boldness\\n(A) Agreeableness Patience, tolerance, gentleness\\n(C) Conscientiousness Organization, thoroughness, precision\\n(O) Openness Creativity, inquisitiveness, innovativeness\\nTABLE 11.6\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nTake the Big Five Personality test (http://openstax.org/l/big5) to find out about your personality and where you\\nfall on the Big Five factors.\\n11.8 Cultural Understandings of Personality\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section you should be able to:\\n• Discuss personality differences of people from collectivist and individualist cultures\\n• Discuss the three approaches to studying personality in a cultural context\\nAs you have learned in this chapter, personality is shaped by both genetic and environmental factors. The\\nculture in which you live is one of the most important environmental factors that shapes your personality\\n(Triandis & Suh, 2002). The term culture refers to all of the beliefs, customs, art, and traditions of a particular\\nsociety. Culture is transmitted to people through language as well as through the modeling of culturally\\nacceptable and nonacceptable behaviors that are either rewarded or punished (Triandis & Suh, 2002). With\\nthese ideas in mind, personality psychologists have become interested in the role of culture in understanding\\npersonality. They ask whether personality traits are the same across cultures or if there are variations. It\\nappears that there are both universal and culture-specific aspects that account for variation in people’s\\npersonalities.\\nWhy might it be important to consider cultural influences on personality? Western ideas about personality\\nmay not be applicable to other cultures (Benet-Martinez & Oishi, 2008). In fact, there is evidence that the\\nstrength of personality traits varies across cultures. Let’s take a look at some of the Big Five factors\\n(conscientiousness, neuroticism, openness, and extroversion) across cultures. As you will learn when you\\nstudy social psychology, Asian cultures are more collectivist, and people in these cultures tend to be less\\nextroverted. People in Central and South American cultures tend to score higher on openness to experience,\\nwhereas Europeans score higher on neuroticism (Benet-Martinez & Karakitapoglu-Aygun, 2003).\\nAccording to a study by Rentfrow and colleagues, there also seem to be regional personality differences within\\nthe United States (Figure 11.15). Researchers analyzed responses from over 1.5 million individuals in the\\nUnited States and found that there are three distinct regional personality clusters: Cluster 1, which is in the\\nUpper Midwest and Deep South, is dominated by people who fall into the “friendly and conventional”\\npersonality; Cluster 2, which includes the West, is dominated by people who are more relaxed, emotionally\\n384 11 • Personality\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nstable, calm, and creative; and Cluster 3, which includes the Northeast, has more people who are stressed,\\nirritable, and depressed. People who live in Clusters 2 and 3 are also generally more open (Rentfrow et al.,\\n2013).\\nFIGURE 11.15 Researchers found three distinct regional personality clusters in the United States. People tend to be\\nfriendly and conventional in the Upper Midwest and Deep South; relaxed, emotionally stable, and creative in the\\nWest; and stressed, irritable, and depressed in the Northeast (Rentfrow et al., 2013).\\nOne explanation for the regional differences is selective migration (Rentfrow et al., 2013). Selective migration\\nis the concept that people choose to move to places that are compatible with their personalities and needs. For\\nexample, a person high on the agreeable scale would likely want to live near family and friends, and would\\nchoose to settle or remain in such an area. In contrast, someone high on openness would prefer to settle in a\\nplace that is recognized as diverse and innovative (such as California). Further, Rentfrow, Jost, Gosling, & Potter\\n(2009) noted an overlap between geographical regions and personality characteristics that goes beyond the\\noften-used explanations of religion, racial diversity, and education. Their research suggests that the\\npsychological profile of a region is closely related to that of its residents. They found that levels of openness\\nand conscientiousness in a state may predict voting patterns, indicating that there are correlations between\\ngeographic regions and personality differences between liberals and conservatives relating to political views,\\nlevels of economic vitality, and entrepreneurial rates.\\nPersonality in Individualist and Collectivist Cultures\\nIndividualist cultures and collectivist cultures place emphasis on different basic values. People who live in\\nindividualist cultures tend to believe that independence, competition, and personal achievement are\\nimportant. Individuals in Western nations such as the United States, England, and Australia score high on\\n11.8 • Cultural Understandings of Personality 385\\nindividualism (Oyserman, Coon, & Kemmelmier, 2002). People who live in collectivist cultures value social\\nharmony, respectfulness, and group needs over individual needs. Individuals who live in countries in Asia,\\nAfrica, and South America score high on collectivism (Hofstede, 2001; Triandis, 1995). These values influence\\npersonality. For example, Yang (2006) found that people in individualist cultures displayed more personally\\noriented personality traits, whereas people in collectivist cultures displayed more socially oriented personality\\ntraits. Frewer and Bleus (1991) conducted a study of the Eysenk Personality Inventory in a collectivist culture\\nusing Papua New Guinean university students. They found that the results of the personality inventory were\\nonly relevant when analyzed within the context of a collectivist society. Similarly, Dana (1986) suggested that\\npersonality assessment services for Native Americans are often provided without a proper recognition of\\nculture-specific responses and a tribe-specific frame of reference. Assessors need to have more than a general\\nknowledge of history, tribal differences, contemporary culture on reservations, and levels of acculturation in\\norder to interpret psychological test responses with a minimal bias.\\nApproaches to Studying Personality in a Cultural Context\\nThere are three approaches that can be used to study personality in a cultural context, the cultural-\\ncomparative approach; the indigenous approach; and the combined approach, which incorporates elements of\\nboth views. Since ideas about personality have a Western basis, the cultural-comparative approach seeks to\\ntest Western ideas about personality in other cultures to determine whether they can be generalized and if\\nthey have cultural validity (Cheung van de Vijver, & Leong, 2011). For example, recall from the previous section\\non the trait perspective that researchers used the cultural-comparative approach to test the universality of\\nMcCrae and Costa’s Five Factor Model. They found applicability in numerous cultures around the world, with\\nthe Big Five factors being stable in many cultures (McCrae & Costa, 1997; McCrae et al., 2005). The indigenous\\napproach came about in reaction to the dominance of Western approaches to the study of personality in non-\\nWestern settings (Cheung et al., 2011). Because Western-based personality assessments cannot fully capture\\nthe personality constructs of other cultures, the indigenous model has led to the development of personality\\nassessment instruments that are based on constructs relevant to the culture being studied (Cheung et al.,\\n2011). The third approach to cross-cultural studies of personality is the combined approach, which serves as a\\nbridge between Western and indigenous psychology as a way of understanding both universal and cultural\\nvariations in personality (Cheung et al., 2011).\\n11.9 Personality Assessment\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Discuss the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory\\n• Recognize and describe common projective tests used in personality assessment\\nRoberto, Mikhail, and Nat are college friends and all want to be police officers. Roberto is quiet and shy, lacks\\nself-confidence, and usually follows others. He is a kind person, but lacks motivation. Mikhail is loud and\\nboisterous, a leader. He works hard, but is impulsive and drinks too much on the weekends. Nat is thoughtful\\nand well liked. They are trustworthy, but are very methodical and therefore have difficulty making quick\\ndecisions. Of these three, who would make the best police officer? What qualities and personality factors make\\nsomeone a good police officer? What makes someone a bad or dangerous police officer?\\nA police officer’s job is very high in stress, and law enforcement agencies want to make sure they hire the right\\npeople. Personality testing is often used for this purpose—to screen applicants for employment and job\\ntraining. Personality tests are also used in criminal cases and custody battles, and to assess psychological\\ndisorders. This section explores the best known among the many different types of personality tests.\\nSelf-Report Inventories\\nSelf-report inventories are a kind of objective test used to assess personality. They typically use multiple-\\nchoice items or numbered scales, which represent a range from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).\\n386 11 • Personality\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\n', 'answer': 'Answer VERY concisely from the provided context only.

Psychologists Hans and Sybil Eysenck were personality theorists (Figure 11.12) who focused on temperament, the inborn, genetically based personality differences that you studied earlier in the chapter. They believed personality is largely governed by biology. The Eysencks (Eysenck, 1990, 1992; Eysenck & Eysenck, 1963) viewed people as having two specific personality dimensions: extroversion/introversion and neuroticism/ stability. 380 11 • Personality Access for free at openstax.org FIGURE 11.12 Hans and Sybil Eysenck believed that our personality traits are influenced by our genetic inheritance. (credit: \"Sirswindon\"/Wikimedia Commons) According to their theory, people high on the trait of extroversion are sociable and outgoing, and readily connect with others, whereas people high on the trait of introversion have a higher need to be alone, engage in solitary behaviors, and limit their interactions with others. In the neuroticism/stability dimension, people high on neuroticism tend to be anxious; they tend to have an overactive sympathetic nervous system and, even with low stress, their bodies and emotional state tend to go into a flight-or-fight reaction. In contrast, stable people tend to be less anxious and more relaxed. People with a high level of extraversion and low levels of anxiety are called extroverts, while people with high levels anxiety and a low need for social interaction are classified as introverts. Extroverted and introverted people differ from each other in a number of ways. For example, they differ in their attitudes toward stress. Introverts are more sensitive to stress and are less able to cope with stressful situations. They are also more likely to withdraw from social situations. On the other hand, extraverts are generally more tolerant of stress because they are not as easily overwhelmed by it. Extraverted individuals may be more prone to feeling stressed out, but they can also be better at coping with stress. In addition to these personality characteristics, there are several other traits that can be used to classify people into different personality types. Some of these traits include openness to experience, conscientiousness, agreeableness, and emotional stability. These traits can help you determine which personality type you are and how you can use your strengths and weaknesses to become a better person.

CONTEXT: Personality Traits and Personality Tests Personality tests are designed to measure a person\\'s personality in order to determine whether or not he or she is a good fit for a particular job, relationship, or social situation. There are many different types of tests available, including personality inventories, personality questionnaires, self-report measures, behavioral measurements, etc. Each type of test has its own advantages and disadvantages, so it is important to choose a test that is appropriate for the job you want to apply for or the relationship you wish to establish. The most widely used personality test is the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). The MBTI was developed by Carl R. Jung, a Swiss psychiatrist, who was also the founder of the Jungian school of psychology. It was introduced to the United States by Carl Jung and his wife, Isabel Briggs Myers, as a way to help people understand themselves better.

Aaron Alexis, 34, had a troubled history: he thought that he was\\nbeing controlled by radio waves. He called the police to complain about voices in his head and being under\\nsurveillance by “shadowy forces” (Thomas, Levine, Date, & Cloherty, 2013). While Alexis’s actions cannot be\\nexcused, it is clear that he had some form of mental illness. Mental illness is not necessarily a cause of\\nviolence; it is far more likely that the mentally ill will be victims rather than perpetrators of violence (Stuart,\\n2003). If, however, Alexis had received the help he needed, this tragedy might have been averted.\\n15Psychological Disorders\\n15.1 What Are Psychological Disorders?\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Understand the problems inherent in defining the concept of psychological disorder\\n• Describe what is meant by harmful dysfunction\\n• Identify the formal criteria that thoughts, feelings, and behaviors must meet to be considered abnormal and,\\nthus, symptomatic of a psychological disorder\\nAccording to the American Psychiatric Association, a psychological disorder, or mental disorder, is “a\\nsyndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotion regulation,\\nor behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological, or developmental processes underlying\\nmental functioning. Mental disorders are usually associated with significant distress in social, occupational, or\\nother important activities” (2013). Psychopathology is the study of psychological disorders, including their\\nsymptoms, etiology (i.e., their causes), and treatment. The term psychopathology can also refer to the\\nmanifestation of a psychological disorder. Although consensus can be difficult, it is extremely important for\\nmental health professionals to agree on what kinds of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are truly abnormal in\\nthe sense that they genuinely indicate the presence of psychopathology. Certain patterns of behavior and inner\\nexperience can easily be labeled as abnormal and clearly signify some kind of psychological disturbance. The\\nperson who washes their hands 40 times per day and the person who claims to hear the voices of demons\\nexhibit behaviors and inner experiences that most would regard as abnormal: beliefs and behaviors that\\nsuggest the existence of a psychological disorder. But, consider the nervousness a young man feels when\\ntalking to an attractive person or the loneliness and longing for home a first-year student experiences during\\nher first semester of college—these feelings may not be regularly present, but they fall in the range of normal.\\nSo, what kinds of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors represent a true psychological disorder? Psychologists work\\nto distinguish psychological disorders from inner experiences and behaviors that are merely situational,\\nidiosyncratic, or unconventional.\\nMental health issues are often incorrectly viewed as less important than physical illnesses, and sometimes\\npeople are blamed or otherwise stigmatized for their condition. People with mental illnesses did not choose or\\ncreate their illness, and cannot simply manage it through positive thinking or other attitudinal changes.\\nDiagnosis, treatment, and support are all necessary, and all must be considered with respect and sensitivity to\\nthe extremely challenging nature of mental illness. While not everyone experiencing difficulty has a\\npsychological disorder, mental health is critical to our ability to function in our relationships, education, and\\nwork. It is important that people talk with qualified professionals if they are having persistent feelings or\\nexperiences in line with the descriptions below; the discussion may or may not lead to a diagnosis, but as with\\nphysical illnesses, one has a better chance at success if they raise the issues with doctors or other experts.\\nDefinition of a Psychological Disorder\\nPerhaps the simplest approach to conceptualizing psychological disorders is to label behaviors, thoughts, and\\ninner experiences that are atypical, distressful, dysfunctional, and sometimes even dangerous, as signs of a\\ndisorder. For example, if you ask a classmate for a date and you are rejected, you probably would feel a little\\ndejected. Such feelings would be normal. If you felt extremely depressed—so much so that you lost interest in\\nactivities, had difficulty eating or sleeping, felt utterly worthless, and contemplated suicide—your feelings\\nwould be atypical, would deviate from the norm, and could signify the presence of a psychological disorder.\\nJust because something is atypical, however, does not necessarily mean it is disordered.\\nFor example, only about 4% of people in the United States have red hair, so red hair is considered an atypical\\ncharacteristic (Figure 15.2), but it is not considered disordered, it’s just unusual. And it is less unusual in\\nScotland, where approximately 13% of the population has red hair (“DNA Project Aims,” 2012). As you will\\nlearn, some disorders, although not exactly typical, are far from atypical, and the rates in which they appear in\\nthe population are surprisingly high.\\n538 15 • Psychological Disorders\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nFIGURE 15.2 Red hair is considered unusual, but not abnormal. (a) Isla Fischer, (b) Prince Harry, and (c) Marcia\\nCross are three natural redheads. (credit a: modification of work by Richard Goldschmidt; credit b: modification of\\nwork by Glyn Lowe; credit c: modification of work by Kirk Weaver)\\nIf we can agree that merely being atypical is an insufficient criterion for a having a psychological disorder, is it\\nreasonable to consider behavior or inner experiences that differ from widely expected cultural values or\\nexpectations as disordered? Using this criterion, a person who walks around a subway platform wearing a\\nheavy winter coat in July while screaming obscenities at strangers may be considered as exhibiting symptoms\\nof a psychological disorder. Their actions and clothes violate socially accepted rules governing appropriate\\ndress and behavior; these characteristics are atypical.\\nCultural Expectations\\nViolating cultural expectations is not, in and of itself, a satisfactory means of identifying the presence of a\\npsychological disorder. Since behavior varies from one culture to another, what may be expected and\\nconsidered appropriate in one culture may not be viewed as such in other cultures. For example, returning a\\nstranger’s smile is expected in the United States because a pervasive social norm dictates that we reciprocate\\nfriendly gestures. A person who refuses to acknowledge such gestures might be considered socially\\nawkward—perhaps even disordered—for violating this expectation. However, such expectations are not\\nuniversally shared. Cultural expectations in Japan involve showing reserve, restraint, and a concern for\\nmaintaining privacy around strangers. Japanese people are generally unresponsive to smiles from strangers\\n(Patterson et al., 2007). Eye contact provides another example. In the United States and Europe, eye contact\\nwith others typically signifies honesty and attention. However, most Latin-American, Asian, and African\\ncultures interpret direct eye contact as rude, confrontational, and aggressive (Pazain, 2010). Thus, someone\\nwho makes eye contact with you could be considered appropriate and respectful or brazen and offensive,\\ndepending on your culture (Figure 15.3).\\nFIGURE 15.3 Eye contact is one of many social gestures that vary from culture to culture.

One of the major criticisms focused\\non the notion that mental illness was a “myth that justifies psychiatric intervention in socially disapproved\\nbehavior” (Wakefield, 1992). Thomas Szasz (1960), a noted psychiatrist, was perhaps the biggest proponent of\\nthis view. Szasz argued that the notion of mental illness was invented by society (and the mental health\\nestablishment) to stigmatize and subjugate people whose behavior violates accepted social and legal norms.\\nIndeed, Szasz suggested that what appear to be symptoms of mental illness are more appropriately\\ncharacterized as “problems in living” (Szasz, 1960).\\nIn his 1961 book, The Myth of Mental Illness: Foundations of a Theory of Personal Conduct, Szasz expressed his\\ndisdain for the concept of mental illness and for the field of psychiatry in general (Oliver, 2006). The basis for\\nSzasz’s attack was his contention that detectable abnormalities in bodily structures and functions (e.g.,\\ninfections and organ damage or dysfunction) represent the defining features of genuine illness or disease, and\\nbecause symptoms of purported mental illness are not accompanied by such detectable abnormalities, so-called\\npsychological disorders are not disorders at all. Szasz (1961/2010) proclaimed that “disease or illness can only\\naffect the body; hence, there can be no mental illness” (p. 267).\\nToday, we recognize the extreme level of psychological suffering experienced by people with psychological\\ndisorders: the painful thoughts and feelings they experience, the disordered behavior they demonstrate, and the\\nlevels of distress and impairment they exhibit. This makes it very difficult to deny the reality of mental illness.\\nHowever controversial Szasz’s views and those of his supporters might have been, they have influenced the\\nmental health community and society in several ways. First, lay people, politicians, and professionals now often\\nrefer to mental illness as mental health “problems,” implicitly acknowledging the “problems in living”\\nperspective Szasz described (Buchanan-Barker & Barker, 2009). Also influential was Szasz’s view of sexual\\norientation. Szasz was perhaps the first psychiatrist to openly challenge the idea that same-sex attraction\\nrepresented a form of mental illness or disease (Szasz, 1965), which helped pave the way for the social and civil\\nrights that gay and lesbian people now have (Barker, 2010). His work also inspired legal changes that protect the\\nrights of people in psychiatric institutions and allow such individuals a greater degree of influence and\\nresponsibility over their lives (Buchanan-Barker & Barker, 2009).\\nHarmful Dysfunction\\nIf none of the criterion discussed so far is adequate by itself to define the presence of a psychological disorder,\\nhow can a disorder be conceptualized?

For example, learning allows us to associate a fear with a potential\\nDIG DEEPER\\n540 15 • Psychological Disorders\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\ndanger in such a way that the intensity of fear is roughly equal to the degree of actual danger. Dysfunction\\noccurs when an internal mechanism breaks down and can no longer perform its normal function. But, the\\npresence of a dysfunction by itself does not determine a disorder. The dysfunction must be harmful in that it\\nleads to negative consequences for the individual or for others, as judged by the standards of the individual’s\\nculture. The harm may include significant internal anguish (e.g., high levels of anxiety or depression) or\\nproblems in day-to-day living (e.g., in one’s social or work life).\\nTo illustrate, Janet has an extreme fear of spiders. Janet’s fear might be considered a dysfunction in that it\\nsignals that the internal mechanism of learning is not working correctly (i.e., a faulty process prevents Janet\\nfrom appropriately associating the magnitude of fear with the actual threat posed by spiders). Janet’s fear of\\nspiders has a significant negative influence on daily life: she avoids all situations in which she suspects spiders\\nto be present (e.g., the basement or a friend’s home), and she quit her job last month because she saw a spider\\nin the restroom at work and is now unemployed. According to the harmful dysfunction model, Janet’s\\ncondition would signify a disorder because (a) there is a dysfunction in an internal mechanism, and (b) the\\ndysfunction has resulted in harmful consequences. Similar to how the symptoms of physical illness reflect\\ndysfunctions in biological processes, the symptoms of psychological disorders presumably reflect\\ndysfunctions in mental processes. The internal mechanism component of this model is especially appealing\\nbecause it implies that disorders may occur through a breakdown of biological functions that govern various\\npsychological processes, thus supporting contemporary neurobiological models of psychological disorders\\n(Fabrega, 2007).\\nThe American Psychiatric Association (APA) Definition\\nMany of the features of the harmful dysfunction model are incorporated in a formal definition of psychological\\ndisorder developed by the American Psychiatric Association (APA). According to the APA (2013), a\\npsychological disorder is a condition that is said to consist of the following:\\n• There are significant disturbances in thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. A person must experience\\ninner states (e.g., thoughts and/or feelings) and exhibit behaviors that are clearly disturbed—that is,\\nunusual, but in a negative, self-defeating way. Often, such disturbances are troubling to those around the\\nindividual who experiences them. For example, an individual who is uncontrollably preoccupied by\\nthoughts of germs spends hours each day bathing, has inner experiences, and displays behaviors that\\nmost would consider atypical and negative (disturbed) and that would likely be troubling to family\\nmembers.\\n• The disturbances reflect some kind of biological, psychological, or developmental dysfunction.\\nDisturbed patterns of inner experiences and behaviors should reflect some flaw (dysfunction) in the\\ninternal biological, psychological, and developmental mechanisms that lead to normal, healthy\\npsychological functioning. For example, the hallucinations observed in schizophrenia could be a sign of\\nbrain abnormalities.\\n• The disturbances lead to significant distress or disability in one’s life. A person’s inner experiences and\\nbehaviors are considered to reflect a psychological disorder if they cause the person considerable distress,\\nor greatly impair their ability to function as a normal individual (often referred to as functional\\nimpairment, or occupational and social impairment). As an illustration, a person’s fear of social situations\\nmight be so distressing that it causes the person to avoid all social situations (e.g., preventing that person\\nfrom being able to attend class or apply for a job).\\n• The disturbances do not reflect expected or culturally approved responses to certain events.\\nDisturbances in thoughts, feelings, and behaviors must be socially unacceptable responses to certain\\nevents that often happen in life. For example, it is perfectly natural (and expected) that a person would\\nexperience great sadness and might wish to be left alone following the death of a close family member.\\nBecause such reactions are in some ways culturally expected, the individual would not be assumed to\\nsignify a mental disorder.\\n15.1 • What Are Psychological Disorders? 541\\nSome believe that there is no essential criterion or set of criteria that can definitively distinguish all cases of\\ndisorder from nondisorder (Lilienfeld & Marino, 1999). In truth, no single approach to defining a psychological\\ndisorder is adequate by itself, nor is there universal agreement on where the boundary is between disordered\\nand not disordered. From time to time we all experience anxiety, unwanted thoughts, and moments of\\nsadness; our behavior at other times may not make much sense to ourselves or to others. These inner\\nexperiences and behaviors can vary in their intensity, but are only considered disordered when they are highly\\ndisturbing to us and/or others, suggest a dysfunction in normal mental functioning, and are associated with\\nsignificant distress or disability in social or occupational activities.\\n15.2 Diagnosing and Classifying Psychological Disorders\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Explain why classification systems are necessary in the study of psychopathology\\n• Describe the basic features of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)\\n• Discuss changes in the DSM over time, including criticisms of the current edition\\n• Identify which disorders are generally the most common\\nA first step in the study of psychological disorders is carefully and systematically discerning significant signs\\nand symptoms. How do mental health professionals ascertain whether or not a person’s inner states and\\nbehaviors truly represent a psychological disorder? Arriving at a proper diagnosis—that is, appropriately\\nidentifying and labeling a set of defined symptoms—is absolutely crucial. This process enables professionals to\\nuse a common language with others in the field and aids in communication about the disorder with the\\npatient, colleagues and the public. A proper diagnosis is an essential element to guide proper and successful\\ntreatment. For these reasons, classification systems that organize psychological disorders systematically are\\nnecessary.\\nThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)\\nAlthough a number of classification systems have been developed over time, the one that is used by most\\nmental health professionals in the United States is the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\\n(DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association (2013). (Note that the American Psychiatric\\nAssociation differs from the American Psychological Association; both are abbreviated APA.) The first edition\\nof the DSM, published in 1952, classified psychological disorders according to a format developed by the U.S.\\nArmy during World War II (Clegg, 2012). In the years since, the DSM has undergone numerous revisions and\\neditions. The most recent edition, published in 2013, is the DSM-5 (APA, 2013). The DSM-5 includes many\\ncategories of disorders (e.g., anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, and dissociative disorders). Each\\ndisorder is described in detail, including an overview of the disorder (diagnostic features), specific symptoms\\nrequired for diagnosis (diagnostic criteria), prevalence information (what percent of the population is thought\\nto be afflicted with the disorder), and risk factors associated with the disorder. Figure 15.4 shows lifetime\\nprevalence rates—the percentage of people in a population who develop a disorder in their lifetime—of various\\npsychological disorders among U.S. adults. These data were based on a national sample of 9,282 U.S. residents\\n(National Comorbidity Survey, 2007).\\n542 15 • Psychological Disorders\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nFIGURE 15.4 The graph shows the breakdown of psychological disorders, comparing the percentage prevalence\\namong adult males and adult females in the United States. Because the data is from 2007, the categories shown\\nhere are from the DSM-IV, which has been supplanted by the DSM-5. Most categories remain the same; however,\\nalcohol abuse now falls under a broader Alcohol Use Disorder category.\\nThe DSM-5 also provides information about comorbidity; the co-occurrence of two disorders. For example, the\\nDSM-5 mentions that 41% of people with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) also meet the diagnostic\\ncriteria for major depressive disorder (Figure 15.5). Problematic substance use is highly comorbid with other\\nmental illnesses; 6 out of 10 people who have a substance use disorder also suffer from another form of mental\\nillness (National Institute on Drug Abuse [NIDA], 2007).\\nFIGURE 15.5 Obsessive-compulsive disorder and major depressive disorder frequently occur in the same person.\\nComorbidity\\nAs you’ve learned in the text, comorbidity refers to situations in which an individual suffers from more than one\\ndisorder, and often the symptoms of each can interact in negative ways. Co-occurrence and comorbidity of\\npsychological disorders are quite common, and some of the most pervasive comorbidities involve substance use\\ndisorders that co-occur with psychological disorders. Indeed, some estimates suggest that around a quarter of\\nCONNECT THE CONCEPTS\\n15.2 • Diagnosing and Classifying Psychological Disorders 543\\npeople who suffer from the most severe cases of mental illness exhibit substance use disorder as well. Conversely,\\naround 10 percent of individuals seeking treatment for substance use disorder have serious mental illnesses.\\nObservations such as these have important implications for treatment options that are available. When people with\\na mental illness are also habitual drug users, their symptoms can be exacerbated and resistant to treatment.\\nFurthermore, it is not always clear whether the symptoms are due to drug use, the mental illness, or a combination\\nof the two. Therefore, it is recommended that behavior is observed in situations in which the individual has ceased\\nusing drugs and is no longer experiencing withdrawal from the drug in order to make the most accurate diagnosis\\n(NIDA, 2018).\\nObviously, substance use disorders are not the only possible comorbidities. In fact, some of the most common\\npsychological disorders tend to co-occur. For instance, more than half of individuals who have a primary diagnosis of\\ndepressive disorder are estimated to exhibit some sort of anxiety disorder. The reverse is also true for those\\ndiagnosed with a primary diagnosis of an anxiety disorder. Further, anxiety disorders and major depression have a\\nhigh rate of comorbidity with several other psychological disorders (Al-Asadi, Klein, & Meyer, 2015).\\nThe DSM has changed considerably in the half-century since it was originally published. The first two editions\\nof the DSM, for example, listed homosexuality as a disorder; however, in 1973, the APA voted to remove it from\\nthe manual (Silverstein, 2009). While the DSM-III did not list homosexuality as a disorder, it introduced a new\\ndiagnosis, ego-dystonic homosexuality, which emphasized same-sex arousal that the patient viewed as\\ninterfering with desired heterosexual relationships and causing distress for the individual. This new diagnosis\\nwas considered by many as a compromise to appease those who viewed homosexuality as a mental illness.\\nOther professionals questioned how appropriate it was to have a separate diagnosis that described the content\\nof an individual's distress. In 1986, the diagnosis was removed from the DSM-III-R (Herek, 2012). Additionally,\\nbeginning with the DSM-III in 1980, mental disorders have been described in much greater detail, and the\\nnumber of diagnosable conditions has grown steadily, as has the size of the manual itself. DSM-I included 106\\ndiagnoses and was 130 total pages, whereas DSM-III included more than 2 times as many diagnoses (265) and\\nwas nearly seven times its size (886 total pages) (Mayes & Horowitz, 2005). Although DSM-5 is longer than\\nDSM-IV, the volume includes only 237 disorders, a decrease from the 297 disorders that were listed in DSM-IV.\\nThe latest edition, DSM-5, includes revisions in the organization and naming of categories and in the\\ndiagnostic criteria for various disorders (Regier, Kuhl, & Kupfer, 2012), while emphasizing careful\\nconsideration of the importance of gender and cultural difference in the expression of various symptoms\\n(Fisher, 2010).\\nSome believe that establishing new diagnoses might overpathologize the human condition by turning common\\nhuman problems into mental illnesses (The Associated Press, 2013). Indeed, the finding that nearly half of all\\nAmericans will meet the criteria for a DSM disorder at some point in their life (Kessler et al., 2005) likely fuels\\nmuch of this skepticism. The DSM-5 is also criticized on the grounds that its diagnostic criteria have been\\nloosened, thereby threatening to “turn our current diagnostic inflation into diagnostic hyperinflation”\\n(Frances, 2012, para. 22). For example, DSM-IV specified that the symptoms of major depressive disorder must\\nnot be attributable to normal bereavement (loss of a loved one). The DSM-5, however, has removed this\\nbereavement exclusion, essentially meaning that grief and sadness after a loved one’s death can constitute\\nmajor depressive disorder.\\nThe International Classification of Diseases\\nA second classification system, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), is also widely recognized.\\nPublished by the World Health Organization (WHO), the ICD was developed in Europe shortly after World War\\nII and, like the DSM, has been revised several times. The categories of psychological disorders in both the DSM\\nand ICD are similar, as are the criteria for specific disorders; however, some differences exist. Although the ICD\\nis used for clinical purposes, this tool is also used to examine the general health of populations and to monitor\\nthe prevalence of diseases and other health problems internationally (WHO, 2013). The ICD is in its 10th\\n544 15 • Psychological Disorders\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nedition (ICD-10); however, efforts are now underway to develop a new edition (ICD-11) that, in conjunction with\\nthe changes in DSM-5, will help harmonize the two classification systems as much as possible (APA, 2013).\\nA study that compared the use of the two classification systems found that worldwide the ICD is more\\nfrequently used for clinical diagnosis, whereas the DSM is more valued for research (Mezzich, 2002). Most\\nresearch findings concerning the etiology and treatment of psychological disorders are based on criteria set\\nforth in the DSM (Oltmanns & Castonguay, 2013). The DSM also includes more explicit disorder criteria, along\\nwith an extensive and helpful explanatory text (Regier et al., 2012). The DSM is the classification system of\\nchoice among U.S. mental health professionals, and this chapter is based on the DSM paradigm.\\nThe Compassionate View of Psychological Disorders\\nAs these disorders are outlined, please bear two things in mind. First, remember that psychological disorders\\nrepresent extremes of inner experience and behavior. If, while reading about these disorders, you feel that\\nthese descriptions begin to personally characterize you, do not worry—this moment of enlightenment probably\\nmeans nothing more than you have had a range of experiences and emotions. Each of us experiences episodes\\nof sadness, anxiety, and preoccupation with certain thoughts—times when we do not quite feel ourselves.\\nThese episodes should not be considered problematic unless the accompanying thoughts and behaviors\\nbecome extreme and have a disruptive effect on one’s life. Second, understand that people with psychological\\ndisorders are far more than just embodiments of their disorders. We do not use terms such as schizophrenics,\\ndepressives, or phobics because they are labels that objectify people who have these conditions, thus\\npromoting biased and disparaging assumptions about them. It is important to remember that a psychological\\ndisorder is not what a person is; it is something that a person has—through no fault of their own. As is the case\\nwith cancer or diabetes, those with psychological disorders suffer debilitating, often painful conditions that are\\nnot of their own choosing. These individuals deserve to be viewed and treated with compassion,\\nunderstanding, and dignity.\\n15.3 Perspectives on Psychological Disorders\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Discuss supernatural perspectives on the origin of psychological disorders, in their historical context\\n• Describe modern biological and psychological perspectives on the origin of psychological disorders\\n• Identify which disorders generally show the highest degree of heritability\\n• Describe the diathesis-stress model and its importance to the study of psychopathology\\nScientists, mental health professionals, and cultural healers may adopt different perspectives in attempting to\\nunderstand or explain the underlying mechanisms that contribute to the development of a psychological\\ndisorder. The specific perspective used in explaining a psychological disorder is extremely important. Each\\nperspective explains psychological disorders, their causes or etiology, and effective treatments from a different\\nviewpoint. Different perspectives provide alternate ways for how to think about the nature of psychopathology.\\nSupernatural Perspectives of Psychological Disorders\\nFor centuries, psychological disorders were viewed from a supernatural perspective: attributed to a force\\nbeyond scientific understanding. Those afflicted were thought to be practitioners of black magic or possessed\\nby spirits (Figure 15.6) (Maher & Maher, 1985). For example, convents throughout Europe in the 16th and 17th\\ncenturies reported hundreds of nuns falling into a state of frenzy in which the afflicted foamed at the mouth,\\nscreamed and convulsed, sexually propositioned priests, and confessed to having carnal relations with devils\\nor Christ. Although, today, these cases would suggest serious mental illness; at the time, these events were\\nroutinely explained as possession by devilish forces (Waller, 2009a). Similarly, grievous fits by young girls are\\nbelieved to have precipitated the witch panic in New England late in the 17th century (Demos, 1983). Such\\nbeliefs in supernatural causes of mental illness are still held in some societies today; for example, beliefs that\\nsupernatural forces cause mental illness are common in some cultures in modern-day Nigeria (Aghukwa,\\n15.3 • Perspectives on Psychological Disorders 545\\n2012).\\nFIGURE 15.6 In The Extraction of the Stone of Madness, a 15th century painting by Hieronymus Bosch, a\\npractitioner is using a tool to extract an object (the supposed “stone of madness”) from the head of an afflicted\\nperson.\\nDancing Mania\\nBetween the 11th and 17th centuries, a curious epidemic swept across Western Europe. Groups of people would\\nsuddenly begin to dance with wild abandon. This compulsion to dance—referred to as dancing\\nmania—sometimes gripped thousands of people at a time (Figure 15.7). Historical accounts indicate that those\\nafflicted would sometimes dance with bruised and bloody feet for days or weeks, screaming of terrible visions\\nand begging priests and monks to save their souls (Waller, 2009b). What caused dancing mania is not known, but\\nseveral explanations have been proposed, including spider venom and ergot poisoning (“Dancing Mania,” 2011).\\nFIGURE 15.7 Although the cause of dancing mania, depicted in this painting, was unclear, the behavior was\\nattributed to supernatural forces.\\nHistorian John Waller (2009a, 2009b) has provided a comprehensive and convincing explanation of dancing\\nmania that suggests the phenomenon was attributable to a combination of three factors: psychological distress,\\nsocial contagion, and belief in supernatural forces. Waller argued that various disasters of the time (such as\\nfamine, plagues, and floods) produced high levels of psychological distress that could increase the likelihood of\\nDIG DEEPER\\n546 15 • Psychological Disorders\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nsuccumbing to an involuntary trance state. Waller indicated that anthropological studies and accounts of\\npossession rituals show that people are more likely to enter a trance state if they expect it to happen, and that\\nentranced individuals behave in a ritualistic manner, their thoughts and behavior shaped by the spiritual beliefs\\nof their culture. Thus, during periods of extreme physical and mental distress, all it took were a few\\npeople—believing themselves to have been afflicted with a dancing curse—to slip into a spontaneous trance and\\nthen act out the part of one who is cursed by dancing for days on end.\\nBiological Perspectives of Psychological Disorders\\nThe biological perspective views psychological disorders as linked to biological phenomena, such as genetic\\nfactors, chemical imbalances, and brain abnormalities; it has gained considerable attention and acceptance in\\nrecent decades (Wyatt & Midkiff, 2006). Evidence from many sources indicates that most psychological\\ndisorders have a genetic component; in fact, there is little dispute that some disorders are largely due to\\ngenetic factors. The graph in Figure 15.8 shows heritability estimates for schizophrenia.\\nFIGURE 15.8 A person’s risk of developing schizophrenia increases if a relative has schizophrenia. The closer the\\ngenetic relationship, the higher the risk.\\nFindings such as these have led many of today’s researchers to search for specific genes and genetic mutations\\nthat contribute to mental disorders. Also, sophisticated neural imaging technology in recent decades has\\nrevealed how abnormalities in brain structure and function might be directly involved in many disorders, and\\nadvances in our understanding of neurotransmitters and hormones have yielded insights into their possible\\nconnections. The biological perspective is currently thriving in the study of psychological disorders.\\nThe Diathesis-Stress Model of Psychological Disorders\\nDespite advances in understanding the biological basis of psychological disorders, the psychosocial\\nperspective is still very important. This perspective emphasizes the importance of learning, stress, faulty and\\nself-defeating thinking patterns, and environmental factors. Perhaps the best way to think about psychological\\ndisorders, then, is to view them as originating from a combination of biological and psychological processes.\\nMany develop not from a single cause, but from a delicate fusion between partly biological and partly\\npsychosocial factors.\\nThe diathesis-stress model (Zuckerman, 1999) integrates biological and psychosocial factors to predict the\\nlikelihood of a disorder. This diathesis-stress model suggests that people with an underlying predisposition for\\n15.3 • Perspectives on Psychological Disorders 547\\nin the above studies were diagnosed. Studies that include more recent outcomes show positive effects of\\ntreatment as opposed to non-treatment (Harpin, 2013; Arnold 2015). In most cases, the same studies indicate\\nthat more research and work needs to be undertaken to understand the most effect treatments and their\\nimpacts.\\nCauses of ADHD\\nFamily and twin studies indicate that genetics play a significant role in the development of ADHD. Burt (2009),\\nin a review of 26 studies, reported that the median rate of concordance for identical twins was .66 (one study\\nreported a rate of .90), whereas the median concordance rate for fraternal twins was .20. This study also found\\nthat the median concordance rate for unrelated (adoptive) siblings was .09; although this number is small, it is\\ngreater than 0, thus suggesting that the environment may have at least some influence. Another review of\\nstudies concluded that the heritability of inattention and hyperactivity were 71% and 73%, respectively\\n(Nikolas & Burt, 2010).\\nThe specific genes involved in ADHD are thought to include at least two that are important in the regulation of\\nthe neurotransmitter dopamine (Gizer, Ficks, & Waldman, 2009), suggesting that dopamine may be important\\nin ADHD. Indeed, medications used in the treatment of ADHD, such as methylphenidate (Ritalin) and\\namphetamine with dextroamphetamine (Adderall), have stimulant qualities and elevate dopamine activity.\\nPeople with ADHD show less dopamine activity in key regions of the brain, especially those associated with\\nmotivation and reward (Volkow et al., 2009), which provides support to the theory that dopamine deficits may\\nbe a vital factor in the development this disorder (Swanson et al., 2007).\\nBrain imaging studies have shown that children with ADHD exhibit abnormalities in their frontal lobes, an area\\nin which dopamine is in abundance. Compared to children without ADHD, those with ADHD appear to have\\nsmaller frontal lobe volume, and they show less frontal lobe activation when performing mental tasks. Recall\\nthat one of the functions of the frontal lobes is to inhibit our behavior. Thus, abnormalities in this region may\\ngo a long way toward explaining the hyperactive, uncontrolled behavior of ADHD.\\nBy the 1970s, many had become aware of the connection between nutritional factors and childhood behavior.\\nAt the time, much of the public believed that hyperactivity was caused by sugar and food additives, such as\\nartificial coloring and flavoring. Undoubtedly, part of the appeal of this hypothesis was that it provided a\\nsimple explanation of (and treatment for) behavioral problems in children. A statistical review of 16 studies,\\nhowever, concluded that sugar consumption has no effect at all on the behavioral and cognitive performance of\\nchildren (Wolraich, Wilson, & White, 1995). Additionally, although food additives have been shown to increase\\nhyperactivity in non-ADHD children, the effect is rather small (McCann et al., 2007). Numerous studies,\\nhowever, have shown a significant relationship between exposure to nicotine in cigarette smoke during the\\nprenatal period and ADHD (Linnet et al., 2003). Maternal smoking during pregnancy is associated with the\\ndevelopment of more severe symptoms of the disorder (Thakur et al., 2013).\\nIs ADHD caused by poor parenting? No. Remember, the genetics studies discussed above suggested that the\\nfamily environment does not seem to play much of a role in the development of this disorder; if it did, we\\nwould expect the concordance rates to be higher for fraternal twins and adoptive siblings than has been\\ndemonstrated. All things considered, the evidence seems to point to the conclusion that ADHD is triggered\\nmore by genetic and neurological factors and less by social or environmental ones.\\nWhy Is the Prevalence Rate of ADHD Increasing?\\nMany people believe that the rates of ADHD have increased in recent years, and there is evidence to support this\\ncontention. In a recent study, investigators found that the parent-reported prevalence of ADHD among children\\n(4–17 years old) in the United States increased by 22% during a 4-year period, from 7.8% in 2003 to 9.5% in\\nDIG DEEPER\\n578 15 • Psychological Disorders\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\n2007 (CDC, 2010). Over time this increase in parent-reported ADHD was observed in all sociodemographic\\ngroups and was reflected by substantial increases in 12 states (Indiana, North Carolina, and Colorado were the\\ntop three). The increases were greatest for older teens (ages 15–17), multiracial and Hispanic children, and\\nchildren with a primary language other than English. Another investigation found that from 1998–2000 through\\n2007–2009 the parent-reported prevalence of ADHD increased among U.S. children between the ages of 5–17\\nyears old, from 6.9% to 9.0% (Akinbami, Liu, Pastor, & Reuben, 2011).\\nA major weakness of both studies was that children were not actually given a formal diagnosis. Instead, parents\\nwere simply asked whether or not a doctor or other health-care provider had ever told them their child had\\nADHD; the reported prevalence rates thus may have been affected by the accuracy of parental memory.\\nNevertheless, the findings from these studies raise important questions concerning what appears to be a\\ndemonstrable rise in the prevalence of ADHD. Although the reasons underlying this apparent increase in the\\nrates of ADHD over time are poorly understood and, at best, speculative, several explanations are viable:\\n• ADHD may be over-diagnosed by doctors who are too quick to medicate children as a behavior treatment.\\n• There is greater awareness of ADHD now than in the past. Nearly everyone has heard of ADHD, and most\\nparents and teachers are aware of its key symptoms. Thus, parents may be quick to take their children to a\\ndoctor if they believe their child possesses these symptoms, or teachers may be more likely now than in the\\npast to notice the symptoms and refer the child for evaluation.\\n• The use of computers, video games, iPhones, and other electronic devices has become pervasive among\\nchildren in the early 21st century, and these devices could potentially shorten children’s attentions spans.\\nThus, what might seem like inattention to some parents and teachers could simply reflect exposure to too\\nmuch technology.\\n• ADHD diagnostic criteria have changed over time.\\nAutism Spectrum Disorder\\nA seminal paper published in 1943 by psychiatrist Leo Kanner described an unusual neurodevelopmental\\ncondition he observed in a group of children. He called this condition early infantile autism, and it was\\ncharacterized mainly by an inability to form close emotional ties with others, speech and language\\nabnormalities, repetitive behaviors, and an intolerance of minor changes in the environment and in normal\\nroutines (Bregman, 2005). What the DSM-5 refers to as autism spectrum disorder today, is a direct extension\\nof Kanner’s work.\\nAutism spectrum disorder is probably the most misunderstood of the neurodevelopmental disorders. Children\\nwith this disorder show signs of significant disturbances in three main areas: (a) deficits in social interaction,\\n(b) deficits in communication, and (c) repetitive patterns of behavior or interests. These disturbances appear\\nearly in life and cause serious impairments in functioning (APA, 2013). The child with autism spectrum\\ndisorder might exhibit deficits in social interaction by not initiating conversations with other children or\\nturning their head away when spoken to. Typically, these children do not make eye contact with others and\\nseem to prefer playing alone rather than with others. In some cases, it is almost as though these individuals\\nlive in a personal and isolated social world others are simply not privy to or able to penetrate. Communication\\ndeficits can range from a complete lack of speech, to one word responses (e.g., saying “Yes” or “No” when\\nreplying to questions or statements that require additional elaboration), to echoed speech (e.g., parroting what\\nanother person says, either immediately or several hours or even days later), to difficulty maintaining a\\nconversation because of an inability to reciprocate others’ comments. These deficits can also include problems\\nin using and understanding nonverbal cues (e.g., facial expressions, gestures, and postures) that facilitate\\nnormal communication.\\nRepetitive patterns of behavior or interests can be exhibited a number of ways. The child might engage in\\nstereotyped, repetitive movements (rocking, head-banging, or repeatedly dropping an object and then picking\\n15.10 • Disorders in Childhood 579\\nit up), or they might show great distress at small changes in routine or the environment. In some cases, the\\nperson with autism spectrum disorder might show highly restricted and fixated interests that appear to be\\nabnormal in their intensity. For instance, the person might learn and memorize every detail about something\\neven though doing so serves no apparent purpose. Importantly, autism spectrum disorder is not the same\\nthing as intellectual disability, although these two conditions are often comorbid. The DSM-5 specifies that the\\nsymptoms of autism spectrum disorder are not caused or explained by intellectual disability.\\nLife Problems From Autism Spectrum Disorder\\nAutism spectrum disorder is referred to in everyday language as autism; in fact, the disorder was termed\\n“autistic disorder” in earlier editions of the DSM, and its diagnostic criteria were much narrower than those of\\nautism spectrum disorder. The qualifier “spectrum” in autism spectrum disorder is used to indicate that\\nindividuals with the disorder can show a range, or spectrum, of symptoms that vary in their magnitude and\\nseverity: some severe, others less severe. The previous edition of the DSM included a diagnosis of Asperger’s\\ndisorder, generally recognized as a less severe form of autistic disorder; individuals diagnosed with Asperger’s\\ndisorder were described as having average or high intelligence and a strong vocabulary, but exhibiting\\nimpairments in social interaction and social communication, such as talking only about their special interests\\n(Wing, Gould, & Gillberg, 2011). However, because research has failed to demonstrate that Asperger’s disorder\\ndiffers qualitatively from autistic disorder, the DSM-5 does not include it, which is prompting concerns among\\nsome parents that their children may no longer be eligible for special services (“Asperger’s Syndrome\\nDropped,” 2012). Some individuals with autism spectrum disorder, particularly those with better language and\\nintellectual skills, can live and work independently as adults. However, most do not because the symptoms\\nremain sufficient to cause serious impairment in many realms of life (APA, 2013).\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nWatch this video about early signs of autism (http://openstax.org/l/sevautism) to learn more.\\nCurrent estimates from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s Autism and Developmental Disabilities\\nMonitoring Network indicate that 1 in 59 children in the United States has autism spectrum disorder; the\\ndisorder is 4 times more common among boys (1 in 38) than in girls (1 in 152) (Baio et al, 2018). Rates of\\nautistic spectrum disorder have increased dramatically since the 1980s. For example, California saw an\\nincrease of 273% in reported cases from 1987 through 1998 (Byrd, 2002); between 2000 and 2008, the rate of\\nautism diagnoses in the United States increased 78% (CDC, 2012). Although it is difficult to interpret this\\nincrease, it is possible that the rise in prevalence is the result of the broadening of the diagnosis, increased\\nefforts to identify cases in the community, and greater awareness and acceptance of the diagnosis. In addition,\\nmental health professionals are now more knowledgeable about autism spectrum disorder and are better\\nequipped to make the diagnosis, even in subtle cases (Novella, 2008).\\nCauses of Autism Spectrum Disorder\\nThe exact causes of autism spectrum disorder remain unknown despite massive research efforts over the last\\ntwo decades (Meek, Lemery-Chalfant, Jahromi, & Valiente, 2013). Autism appears to be strongly influenced by\\ngenetics, as identical twins show concordance rates of 60%–90%, whereas concordance rates for fraternal\\ntwins and siblings are 5%–10% (Autism Genome Project Consortium, 2007). Many different genes and gene\\nmutations have been implicated in autism (Meek et al., 2013). Among the genes involved are those important\\nin the formation of synaptic circuits that facilitate communication between different areas of the brain\\n(Gauthier et al., 2011). A number of environmental factors are also thought to be associated with increased\\nrisk for autism spectrum disorder, at least in part, because they contribute to new mutations. These factors\\ninclude exposure to pollutants, such as plant emissions and mercury, urban versus rural residence, and\\nvitamin D deficiency (Kinney, Barch, Chayka, Napoleon, & Munir, 2009).\\n580 15 • Psychological Disorders\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nChild Vaccinations and Autism Spectrum Disorder\\nIn the late 1990s, a prestigious medical journal published an article purportedly showing that autism is\\ntriggered by the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine. These findings were very controversial and drew\\na great deal of attention, sparking an international forum on whether children should be vaccinated. In a\\nshocking turn of events, some years later the article was retracted by the journal that had published it after\\nevidence of fraud and unethical practices on the part of the lead researcher. Despite the retraction, the\\nreporting in popular media led to concerns about a possible link between vaccines and autism persisting. A\\nrecent survey of parents, for example, found that roughly a third of respondents expressed such a concern\\n(Kennedy, LaVail, Nowak, Basket, & Landry, 2011); and perhaps fearing that their children would develop\\nautism, more than 10% of parents of young children refuse or delay vaccinations (Dempsey et al., 2011). Some\\nparents of children with autism mounted a campaign against scientists who refuted the vaccine-autism link.\\nEven politicians and several well-known celebrities weighed in; for example, actress Jenny McCarthy (who\\nbelieved that a vaccination caused her son’s autism) co-authored a book on the matter. However, there is no\\nscientific evidence that a link exists between autism and vaccinations (Hughes, 2007). Indeed, a recent study\\ncompared the vaccination histories of 256 children with autism spectrum disorder with that of 752 control\\nchildren across three time periods during their first two years of life (birth to 3 months, birth to 7 months, and\\nbirth to 2 years) (DeStefano, Price, & Weintraub, 2013). At the time of the study, the children were between 6\\nand 13 years old, and their prior vaccination records were obtained. Because vaccines contain immunogens\\n(substances that fight infections), the investigators examined medical records to see how many immunogens\\nchildren received to determine if those children who received more immunogens were at greater risk for\\ndeveloping autism spectrum disorder. The results of this study, a portion of which are shown in Figure 15.19,\\nclearly demonstrate that the quantity of immunogens from vaccines received during the first two years of life\\nwere not at all related to the development of autism spectrum disorder. There is not a relationship between\\nvaccinations and autism spectrum disorders.\\nFIGURE 15.19 In terms of their exposure to immunogens in vaccines, overall, there is not a significant difference\\nbetween children with autism spectrum disorder and their age-matched controls without the disorder (DeStefano et\\nal., 2013).\\nWhy does concern over vaccines and autism spectrum disorder persist? Since the proliferation of the Internet\\nin the 1990s, parents have been constantly bombarded with online information that can become magnified\\nand take on a life of its own. The enormous volume of electronic information pertaining to autism spectrum\\n15.10 • Disorders in Childhood 581\\ndisorder, combined with how difficult it can be to grasp complex scientific concepts, can make separating good\\nresearch from bad challenging (Downs, 2008). Notably, the study that fueled the controversy reported that 8\\nout of 12 children—according to their parents—developed symptoms consistent with autism spectrum\\ndisorder shortly after receiving a vaccination. To conclude that vaccines cause autism spectrum disorder on\\nthis basis, as many did, is clearly incorrect for a number of reasons, not the least of which is because\\ncorrelation does not imply causation, as you’ve learned.\\nAdditionally, as was the case with diet and ADHD in the 1970s, the notion that autism spectrum disorder is\\ncaused by vaccinations is appealing to some because it provides a simple explanation for this condition. Like\\nall disorders, however, there are no simple explanations for autism spectrum disorder. Although the research\\ndiscussed above has shed some light on its causes, science is still a long way from complete understanding of\\nthe disorder.\\n15.11 Personality Disorders\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Describe the nature of personality disorders and how they differ from other disorders\\n• List and distinguish between the three clusters of personality disorders\\n• Identify the basic features of borderline personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder, and the factors\\nthat are important in the etiology of both\\nThe term personality refers loosely to one’s stable, consistent, and distinctive way of thinking about, feeling,\\nacting, and relating to the world. People with personality disorders exhibit a personality style that differs\\nmarkedly from the expectations of their culture, is pervasive and inflexible, begins in adolescence or early\\nadulthood, and causes distress or impairment (APA, 2013). Generally, individuals with these disorders exhibit\\nenduring personality styles that are extremely troubling and often create problems for them and those with\\nwhom they come into contact. Their maladaptive personality styles frequently bring them into conflict with\\nothers, disrupt their ability to develop and maintain social relationships, and prevent them from\\naccomplishing realistic life goals.\\nThe DSM-5 recognizes 10 personality disorders, organized into 3 different clusters. Cluster A disorders include\\nparanoid personality disorder, schizoid personality disorder, and schizotypal personality disorder. People with\\nthese disorders display a personality style that is odd or eccentric. Cluster B disorders include antisocial\\npersonality disorder, histrionic personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder, and borderline\\npersonality disorder. People with these disorders usually are impulsive, overly dramatic, highly emotional, and\\nerratic. Cluster C disorders include avoidant personality disorder, dependent personality disorder, and\\nobsessive-compulsive personality disorder (which is not the same thing as obsessive-compulsive disorder).\\nPeople with these disorders often appear to be nervous and fearful.

Context: cultural expectations, and a person who reports such inner experiences is readily labeled as psychologically disordered. In other cultures, visions that, for example, pertain to future events may be regarded as normal experiences that are positively valued (Bourguignon, 1970). Finally, it is important to recognize that cultural norms change over time: what might be considered typical in a society at one time may no longer be viewed this way later, similar to how fashion trends from one era may elicit quizzical looks decades later—imagine how a headband, legwarmers, and the big hair of the 1980s would go over on your campus today. The Myth of Mental Illness In the 1950s and 1960s, the concept of mental illness was widely criticized. One of the major criticisms focused on the notion that mental illness was a “myth that justifies psychiatric intervention in socially disapproved behavior” (Wakefield, 1992). Thomas Szasz (1960), a noted psychiatrist, was perhaps the biggest proponent of this view. Szasz argued that the notion of mental illness was invented by society (and the mental health establishment) to stigmatize and subjugate people whose behavior violates accepted social and legal norms. Indeed, Szasz suggested that what appear to be symptoms of mental illness are more appropriately characterized as “problems in living” (Szasz, 1960). In his 1961 book, The Myth of Mental Illness: Foundations of a Theory of Personal Conduct, Szasz expressed his disdain for the concept of mental illness and for the field of psychiatry in general (Oliver, 2006). The basis for Szasz’s attack was his contention that detectable abnormalities in bodily structures and functions (e.g., infections and organ damage or dysfunction) represent the defining features of genuine illness or disease, and because symptoms of purported mental illness are not accompanied by such detectable abnormalities, so-called psychological disorders are not disorders at all. Szasz (1961/2010) proclaimed that “disease or illness can only be defined by the presence of disease or abnormality, not by its absence” and that there is no such thing as a “normal” or “healthy” state of mind (p. 3). He went on to argue that psychiatrists and other medical professionals should abandon their efforts to diagnose and treat mental illnesses and instead focus on the improvement of people’s physical health and well-being. Szasz’s views were not shared by most of his contemporaries, however. For instance, in an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine (N Engl J Med), in which he argued against the use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in the treatment of depression, he was met with strong opposition from many of those who believed that ECT was an effective treatment for depression. The article, entitled “Psychiatry and Ectoplasmic Treatment of Depression,” was written by a psychiatrist who was not a member of either the American Psychiatric Association (APA) or the National Association of Social Workers (NASW), and it was rejected by APA and NASW for being “incompatible with the APA’s ethical standards and professional code of conduct” and “contrary to the principles of professional conduct and ethics” of both of these professional organizations (Szasz, et al., n.d.). In addition to rejecting the article in its entirety, many other articles and books were written in response to his views, such as the book The Psychopathology of Everyday Life, which was published by the University of California Press and was heavily criticized for its anti-psychiatrist stance and its emphasis on everyday life rather than on psychiatric diagnosis and treatment (Cohen & Cohen, n. d.). The book was later reprinted by Oxford University Press (OUP) and became a best-seller, selling more than 5 million copies worldwide. It has also been translated into several other languages, including French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Arabic, Hebrew, Swahili, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, Hindi, Kannada, Punjabi, Malayalam, Thai, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Cambodian, Burmese, Lao, Mongolian, Uighur, Kazakh, Tajik, Kyrgyz, Uzbek, Georgian, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Tatar, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Armenian, Bulgarian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish,', 'references': '{\"sections\": [\"Psychological Disorders\", \"Psychological Disorders/Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders\"], \"pages\": [\"592\", \"554\", \"557\"]}'}\n",

Research conducted by the College Board suggests that\\nscores on the SAT have high predictive validity for first-year college students’ GPA (Kobrin, Patterson, Shaw,\\nMattern, & Barbuti, 2008). In this context, predictive validity refers to the test’s ability to effectively predict the\\nGPA of college freshmen. Given that many institutions of higher education require the SAT or ACT for admission,\\nthis high degree of predictive validity might be comforting.\\nHowever, the emphasis placed on SAT or ACT scores in college admissions is changing based on a number of\\nfactors. For one, some researchers assert that these tests are biased, and students from historically marginalized\\npopulations are at a disadvantage that unfairly reduces the likelihood of being admitted into a college (Santelices\\n& Wilson, 2010). Additionally, some research has suggested that the predictive validity of these tests is grossly\\nexaggerated in how well they are able to predict the GPA of first-year college students. In fact, it has been\\nsuggested that the SAT’s predictive validity may be overestimated by as much as 150% (Rothstein, 2004). Many\\ninstitutions of higher education are beginning to consider de-emphasizing the significance of SAT scores in\\nmaking admission decisions (Rimer, 2008).\\nRecent examples of high profile cheating scandals both domestically and abroad have only increased the scrutiny\\nbeing placed on these types of tests, and as of March 2019, more than 1000 institutions of higher education have\\neither relaxed or eliminated the requirements for SAT or ACT testing for admissions (Strauss, 2019, March 19).\\n2.4 Ethics\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Discuss how research involving human subjects is regulated\\n• Summarize the processes of informed consent and debriefing\\n• Explain how research involving animal subjects is regulated\\nToday, scientists agree that good research is ethical in nature and is guided by a basic respect for human\\ndignity and safety. However, as you will read in the feature box, this has not always been the case. Modern\\nresearchers must demonstrate that the research they perform is ethically sound. This section presents how\\nethical considerations affect the design and implementation of research conducted today.\\nResearch Involving Human Participants\\nAny experiment involving the participation of human subjects is governed by extensive, strict guidelines\\ndesigned to ensure that the experiment does not result in harm. Any research institution that receives federal\\nsupport for research involving human participants must have access to an institutional review board (IRB).\\nThe IRB is a committee of individuals often made up of members of the institution’s administration, scientists,\\nand community members (Figure 2.20). The purpose of the IRB is to review proposals for research that\\ninvolves human participants. The IRB reviews these proposals with the principles mentioned above in mind,\\nand generally, approval from the IRB is required in order for the experiment to proceed.\\nEVERYDAY CONNECTION\\n2.4 • Ethics 59\\nFIGURE 2.20 An institution’s IRB meets regularly to review experimental proposals that involve human\\nparticipants. (credit: International Hydropower Association/Flickr)\\nAn institution’s IRB requires several components in any experiment it approves. For one, each participant\\nmust sign an informed consent form before they can participate in the experiment. An informed consent form\\nprovides a written description of what participants can expect during the experiment, including potential risks\\nand implications of the research. It also lets participants know that their involvement is completely voluntary\\nand can be discontinued without penalty at any time. Furthermore, the informed consent guarantees that any\\ndata collected in the experiment will remain completely confidential. In cases where research participants are\\nunder the age of 18, the parents or legal guardians are required to sign the informed consent form.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nView this example of a consent form (http://openstax.org/l/consentform) to learn more.\\nWhile the informed consent form should be as honest as possible in describing exactly what participants will\\nbe doing, sometimes deception is necessary to prevent participants’ knowledge of the exact research question\\nfrom affecting the results of the study. Deception involves purposely misleading experiment participants in\\norder to maintain the integrity of the experiment, but not to the point where the deception could be considered\\nharmful. For example, if we are interested in how our opinion of someone is affected by their attire, we might\\nuse deception in describing the experiment to prevent that knowledge from affecting participants’ responses.\\nIn cases where deception is involved, participants must receive a full debriefing upon conclusion of the\\nstudy—complete, honest information about the purpose of the experiment, how the data collected will be used,\\nthe reasons why deception was necessary, and information about how to obtain additional information about\\nthe study.\\nEthics and the Tuskegee Syphilis Study\\nUnfortunately, the ethical guidelines that exist for research today were not always applied in the past. In 1932,\\nrural, Black men from Tuskegee, Alabama, were recruited to participate in an experiment conducted by the U.S.\\nPublic Health Service, with the aim of studying syphilis in Black men (Figure 2.21). In exchange for free medical\\ncare, meals, and burial insurance, 600 men agreed to participate in the study. A little more than half of the men\\ntested positive for syphilis, and they served as the experimental group (given that the researchers could not\\nrandomly assign participants to groups, this represents a quasi-experiment). The remaining syphilis-free\\nDIG DEEPER\\n60 2 • Psychological Research\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nindividuals served as the control group. However, those individuals that tested positive for syphilis were never\\ninformed that they had the disease.\\nWhile there was no treatment for syphilis when the study began, by 1947 penicillin was recognized as an\\neffective treatment for the disease. Despite this, no penicillin was administered to the participants in this study,\\nand the participants were not allowed to seek treatment at any other facilities if they continued in the study. Over\\nthe course of 40 years, many of the participants unknowingly spread syphilis to their wives (and subsequently\\ntheir children born from their wives) and eventually died because they never received treatment for the disease.\\nThis study was discontinued in 1972 when the experiment was discovered by the national press (Tuskegee\\nUniversity, n.d.). The resulting outrage over the experiment led directly to the National Research Act of 1974 and\\nthe strict ethical guidelines for research on humans described in this chapter. Why is this study unethical? How\\nwere the men who participated and their families harmed as a function of this research?\\nFIGURE 2.21 A participant in the Tuskegee Syphilis Study receives an injection.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nVisit this website about the Tuskegee Syphilis Study (http://openstax.org/l/tuskegee) to learn more.\\nResearch Involving Animal Subjects\\nMany psychologists conduct research involving animal subjects. Often, these researchers use rodents (Figure\\n2.22) or birds as the subjects of their experiments—the APA estimates that 90% of all animal research in\\npsychology uses these species (American Psychological Association, n.d.). Because many basic processes in\\nanimals are sufficiently similar to those in humans, these animals are acceptable substitutes for research that\\nwould be considered unethical in human participants.\\nFIGURE 2.22 Rats, like the one shown here, often serve as the subjects of animal research.\\nThis does not mean that animal researchers are immune to ethical concerns. Indeed, the humane and ethical\\n2.4 • Ethics 61\\ntreatment of animal research subjects is a critical aspect of this type of research. Researchers must design\\ntheir experiments to minimize any pain or distress experienced by animals serving as research subjects.\\nWhereas IRBs review research proposals that involve human participants, animal experimental proposals are\\nreviewed by an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). An IACUC consists of institutional\\nadministrators, scientists, veterinarians, and community members. This committee is charged with ensuring\\nthat all experimental proposals require the humane treatment of animal research subjects. It also conducts\\nsemi-annual inspections of all animal facilities to ensure that the research protocols are being followed. No\\nanimal research project can proceed without the committee’s approval.\\n62 2 • Psychological Research\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nKey Terms\\narchival research method of research using past records or data sets to answer various research questions, or\\nto search for interesting patterns or relationships\\nattrition reduction in number of research participants as some drop out of the study over time\\ncause-and-effect relationship changes in one variable cause the changes in the other variable; can be\\ndetermined only through an experimental research design\\nclinical or case study observational research study focusing on one or a few people\\nconfirmation bias tendency to ignore evidence that disproves ideas or beliefs\\nconfounding variable unanticipated outside factor that affects both variables of interest, often giving the false\\nimpression that changes in one variable causes changes in the other variable, when, in actuality, the\\noutside factor causes changes in both variables\\ncontrol group serves as a basis for comparison and controls for chance factors that might influence the\\nresults of the study—by holding such factors constant across groups so that the experimental\\nmanipulation is the only difference between groups\\ncorrelation relationship between two or more variables; when two variables are correlated, one variable\\nchanges as the other does\\ncorrelation coefficient number from -1 to +1, indicating the strength and direction of the relationship\\nbetween variables, and usually represented by r\\ncross-sectional research compares multiple segments of a population at a single time\\ndebriefing when an experiment involved deception, participants are told complete and truthful information\\nabout the experiment at its conclusion\\ndeception purposely misleading experiment participants in order to maintain the integrity of the experiment\\ndeductive reasoning results are predicted based on a general premise\\ndependent variable variable that the researcher measures to see how much effect the independent variable\\nhad\\ndouble-blind study experiment in which both the researchers and the participants are blind to group\\nassignments\\nempirical grounded in objective, tangible evidence that can be observed time and time again, regardless of\\nwho is observing\\nexperimental group group designed to answer the research question; experimental manipulation is the only\\ndifference between the experimental and control groups, so any differences between the two are due to\\nexperimental manipulation rather than chance\\nexperimenter bias researcher expectations skew the results of the study\\nfact objective and verifiable observation, established using evidence collected through empirical research\\nfalsifiable able to be disproven by experimental results\\ngeneralize inferring that the results for a sample apply to the larger population\\nhypothesis (plural: hypotheses) tentative and testable statement about the relationship between two or more\\nvariables\\nillusory correlation seeing relationships between two things when in reality no such relationship exists\\nindependent variable variable that is influenced or controlled by the experimenter; in a sound experimental\\nstudy, the independent variable is the only important difference between the experimental and control\\ngroup\\ninductive reasoning conclusions are drawn from observations\\ninformed consent process of informing a research participant about what to expect during an experiment,\\nany risks involved, and the implications of the research, and then obtaining the person’s consent to\\nparticipate\\nInstitutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) committee of administrators, scientists,\\nveterinarians, and community members that reviews proposals for research involving non-human\\nanimals\\n2 • Key Terms 63\\n17. ________ means that everyone in the population has the same likelihood of being asked to participate in\\nthe study.\\na. operationalizing\\nb. placebo effect\\nc. random assignment\\nd. random sampling\\n18.

In this section, there was a discussion about researchers arriving at different conclusions about the use of\\ntechnology in certain student populations, with one study determining that a smartphone app for surgery\\nstudents seemed effective, but another study finding negative impacts on sleep, communication, and time\\nmanagement resulting from the use of technology by undergraduates. How might an educational leader\\nbest work through these discrepancies?\\n26. The scientific method is often described as self-correcting and cyclical. Briefly describe your\\nunderstanding of the scientific method with regard to these concepts.\\n27. In this section, conjoined twins, Krista and Tatiana, were described as being potential participants in a\\ncase study. In what other circumstances would you think that this particular research approach would be\\nespecially helpful and why?\\n28. Presumably, reality television programs aim to provide a realistic portrayal of the behavior displayed by\\nthe characters featured in such programs. This section pointed out why this is not really the case. What\\nchanges could be made in the way that these programs are produced that would result in more honest\\nportrayals of realistic behavior?\\n29. Which of the research methods discussed in this section would be best suited to study the impact of diet\\nand exercise on the prevalence of a disease such as diabetes? Why?\\n30. Aside from biomedical research, what other areas of research could greatly benefit by both longitudinal\\nand archival research?\\n31. Earlier in this section, we read about research suggesting that there is a correlation between eating cereal\\nand weight. Cereal companies that present this information in their advertisements could lead someone\\nto believe that eating more cereal causes healthy weight. Why would they make such a claim and what\\narguments could you make to counter this cause-and-effect claim?\\n32. Recently a study was published in the journal, Nutrition and Cancer, which established a negative\\ncorrelation between coffee consumption and breast cancer. Specifically, it was found that women\\nconsuming more than 5 cups of coffee a day were less likely to develop breast cancer than women who\\nnever consumed coffee (Lowcock, Cotterchio, Anderson, Boucher, & El-Sohemy, 2013). Imagine you see a\\nnewspaper story about this research that says, “Coffee Protects Against Cancer.” Why is this headline\\nmisleading and why would a more accurate headline draw less interest?\\n33. Sometimes, true random sampling can be very difficult to obtain. Many researchers make use of\\nconvenience samples as an alternative. For example, one popular convenience sample would involve\\nstudents enrolled in Introduction to Psychology courses. What are the implications of using this sampling\\ntechnique?\\n34. Peer review is an important part of publishing research findings in many scientific disciplines. This\\nprocess is normally conducted anonymously; in other words, the author of the article being reviewed does\\nnot know who is reviewing the article, and the reviewers are unaware of the author’s identity. Why would\\nthis be an important part of this process?\\n2 • Critical Thinking Questions 69\\n35. Some argue that animal research is inherently flawed in terms of being ethical because unlike human\\nparticipants, animals do not consent to be involved in research. Do you agree with this perspective? Given\\nthat animals do not consent to be involved in research projects, what sorts of extra precautions should be\\ntaken to ensure that they receive the most humane treatment possible?\\n36. At the end of the last section, you were asked to design a basic experiment to answer some question of\\ninterest. What ethical considerations should be made with the study you proposed to ensure that your\\nexperiment would conform to the scientific community’s expectations of ethical research?\\nPersonal Application Questions\\n37. Healthcare professionals cite an enormous number of health problems related to obesity, and many\\npeople have an understandable desire to attain a healthy weight. There are many diet programs, services,\\nand products on the market to aid those who wish to lose weight. If a close friend was considering\\npurchasing or participating in one of these products, programs, or services, how would you make sure\\nyour friend was fully aware of the potential consequences of this decision? What sort of information would\\nyou want to review before making such an investment or lifestyle change yourself?\\n38. A friend of yours is working part-time in a local pet store. Your friend has become increasingly interested\\nin how dogs normally communicate and interact with each other, and is thinking of visiting a local\\nveterinary clinic to see how dogs interact in the waiting room. After reading this section, do you think this\\nis the best way to better understand such interactions? Do you have any suggestions that might result in\\nmore valid data?\\n39. As a college student, you are no doubt concerned about the grades that you earn while completing your\\ncoursework. If you wanted to know how overall GPA is related to success in life after college, how would\\nyou choose to approach this question and what kind of resources would you need to conduct this\\nresearch?\\n40. We all have a tendency to make illusory correlations from time to time. Try to think of an illusory\\ncorrelation that is held by you, a family member, or a close friend. How do you think this illusory\\ncorrelation came about and what can be done in the future to combat them?\\n41. Are there any questions about human or animal behavior that you would really like to answer? Generate a\\nhypothesis and briefly describe how you would conduct an experiment to answer your question.\\n42. Take a few minutes to think about all of the advancements that our society has achieved as a function of\\nresearch involving animal subjects.

Many of us have done so,\\nwhether to attempt a repair or simply to satisfy our curiosity. A device’s internal workings are often distinct\\nfrom its user interface on the outside. For example, we don’t think about microchips and circuits when we turn\\nup the volume on a mobile phone; instead, we think about getting the volume just right. Similarly, the inner\\nworkings of the human body are often distinct from the external expression of those workings. It is the job of\\npsychologists to find the connection between these—for example, to figure out how the firings of millions of\\nneurons become a thought.\\nThis chapter strives to explain the biological mechanisms that underlie behavior. These physiological and\\nanatomical foundations are the basis for many areas of psychology. In this chapter, you will learn how genetics\\ninfluence both physiological and psychological traits. You will become familiar with the structure and function\\nof the nervous system. And, finally, you will learn how the nervous system interacts with the endocrine system.\\n3Biopsychology\\n3.1 Human Genetics\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Explain the basic principles of the theory of evolution by natural selection\\n• Describe the differences between genotype and phenotype\\n• Discuss how gene-environment interactions are critical for expression of physical and psychological\\ncharacteristics\\nPsychological researchers study genetics in order to better understand the biological factors that contribute to\\ncertain behaviors. While all humans share certain biological mechanisms, we are each unique. And while our\\nbodies have many of the same parts—brains and hormones and cells with genetic codes—these are expressed\\nin a wide variety of behaviors, thoughts, and reactions.\\nWhy do two people infected by the same disease have different outcomes: one surviving and one succumbing\\nto the ailment? How are genetic diseases passed through family lines? Are there genetic components to\\npsychological disorders, such as depression or schizophrenia? To what extent might there be a psychological\\nbasis to health conditions such as childhood obesity?\\nTo explore these questions, let’s start by focusing on a specific genetic disorder, sickle cell anemia, and how it\\nmight manifest in two affected sisters. Sickle-cell anemia is a genetic condition in which red blood cells, which\\nare normally round, take on a crescent-like shape (Figure 3.2). The changed shape of these cells affects how\\nthey function: sickle-shaped cells can clog blood vessels and block blood flow, leading to high fever, severe\\npain, swelling, and tissue damage.\\nFIGURE 3.2 Normal blood cells travel freely through the blood vessels, while sickle-shaped cells form blockages\\npreventing blood flow.\\nMany people with sickle-cell anemia—and the particular genetic mutation that causes it—die at an early age.\\nWhile the notion of “survival of the fittest” may suggest that people with this disorder have a low survival rate\\nand therefore the disorder will become less common, this is not the case. Despite the negative evolutionary\\neffects associated with this genetic mutation, the sickle-cell gene remains relatively common among people of\\nAfrican descent. Why is this? The explanation is illustrated with the following scenario.\\nImagine two young women—Luwi and Sena—sisters in rural Zambia, Africa. Luwi carries the gene for sickle-\\ncell anemia; Sena does not carry the gene. Sickle-cell carriers have one copy of the sickle-cell gene but do not\\nhave full-blown sickle-cell anemia. They experience symptoms only if they are severely dehydrated or are\\ndeprived of oxygen (as in mountain climbing). Carriers are thought to be immune from malaria (an often\\ndeadly disease that is widespread in tropical climates) because changes in their blood chemistry and immune\\nfunctioning prevent the malaria parasite from having its effects (Gong, Parikh, Rosenthal, & Greenhouse,\\n2013). However, full-blown sickle-cell anemia, with two copies of the sickle-cell gene, does not provide\\nimmunity to malaria.\\n72 3 • Biopsychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\n', 'answer': \"Answer VERY concisely from the provided context only.

      "Response for query ID 33: {'context': 'The Skinner box is a chamber that isolates the subject from the external environment and has a behavior\\nindicator such as a lever or a button. When the animal pushes the button or lever, the box is able to deliver a\\npositive reinforcement of the behavior (such as food) or a punishment (such as a noise).\\nSkinner’s focus on positive and negative reinforcement of learned behaviors had a lasting influence in\\npsychology that has waned somewhat since the growth of research in cognitive psychology. Despite this,\\nconditioned learning is still used in human behavioral modification (Greengrass, 2004).\\nMaslow, Rogers, and Humanism\\nDuring the early 20th century, American psychology was dominated by behaviorism and psychoanalysis.\\nHowever, some psychologists were uncomfortable with what they viewed as limited perspectives being so\\ninfluential to the field. They objected to the pessimism and determinism (all actions driven by the\\nunconscious) of Freud. They also disliked the reductionism, or simplifying nature, of behaviorism.\\nBehaviorism is also deterministic at its core, because it sees human behavior as entirely determined by a\\ncombination of genetics and environment. Some psychologists began to form their own ideas that emphasized\\npersonal control, intentionality, and a true predisposition for “good” as important for our self-concept and our\\nbehavior. Thus, humanism emerged. Humanism is a perspective within psychology that emphasizes the\\npotential for good that is innate to all humans. Two of the most well-known proponents of humanistic\\npsychology are Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers (O’Hara, n.d.).\\nAbraham Maslow (1908–1970) was an American psychologist who is best known for proposing a hierarchy of\\nhuman needs in motivating behavior (Figure 1.7). Although this concept will be discussed in more detail in a\\nlater chapter, a brief overview will be provided here. Maslow asserted that so long as basic needs necessary for\\nsurvival were met (e.g., food, water, shelter), higher-level needs (e.g., social needs) would begin to motivate\\nbehavior. According to Maslow, the highest-level needs relate to self-actualization, a process by which we\\nachieve our full potential. Obviously, the focus on the positive aspects of human nature that are characteristic\\nof the humanistic perspective is evident (Thorne & Henley, 2005). Humanistic psychologists rejected, on\\nprinciple, the research approach based on reductionist experimentation in the tradition of the physical and\\nbiological sciences, because it missed the “whole” human being. Beginning with Maslow and Rogers, there was\\nan insistence on a humanistic research program. This program has been largely qualitative (not\\nmeasurement-based), but there exist a number of quantitative research strains within humanistic psychology,\\nincluding research on happiness, self-concept, meditation, and the outcomes of humanistic psychotherapy\\n(Friedman, 2008).\\n14 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nFIGURE 1.7 Maslow’s hierarchy of needs is shown.\\nCarl Rogers (1902–1987) was also an American psychologist who, like Maslow, emphasized the potential for\\ngood that exists within all people (Figure 1.8). Rogers used a therapeutic technique known as client-centered\\ntherapy in helping his clients deal with problematic issues that resulted in their seeking psychotherapy. Unlike\\na psychoanalytic approach in which the therapist plays an important role in interpreting what conscious\\nbehavior reveals about the unconscious mind, client-centered therapy involves the patient taking a lead role in\\nthe therapy session. Rogers believed that a therapist needed to display three features to maximize the\\neffectiveness of this particular approach: unconditional positive regard, genuineness, and empathy.\\nUnconditional positive regard refers to the fact that the therapist accepts their client for who they are, no\\nmatter what they might say. Provided these factors, Rogers believed that people were more than capable of\\ndealing with and working through their own issues (Thorne & Henley, 2005).\\nFIGURE 1.8 Carl Rogers, shown in this portrait, developed a client-centered therapy method that has been\\ninfluential in clinical settings. (credit: \"Didius\"/Wikimedia Commons)\\nHumanism has been influential to psychology as a whole. Both Maslow and Rogers are well-known names\\namong students of psychology (you will read more about both later in this text), and their ideas have influenced\\nmany scholars. Furthermore, Rogers’ client-centered approach to therapy is still commonly used in\\npsychotherapeutic settings today (O’hara, n.d.)\\n1.2 • History of Psychology 15\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nView a brief video of Carl Rogers describing his therapeutic approach (http://openstax.org/l/crogers1) to learn\\nmore.\\nThe Cognitive Revolution\\nBehaviorism’s emphasis on objectivity and focus on external behavior had pulled psychologists’ attention away\\nfrom the mind for a prolonged period of time. The early work of the humanistic psychologists redirected\\nattention to the individual human as a whole, and as a conscious and self-aware being. By the 1950s, new\\ndisciplinary perspectives in linguistics, neuroscience, and computer science were emerging, and these areas\\nrevived interest in the mind as a focus of scientific inquiry. This particular perspective has come to be known\\nas the cognitive revolution (Miller, 2003). By 1967, Ulric Neisser published the first textbook entitled Cognitive\\nPsychology, which served as a core text in cognitive psychology courses around the country (Thorne & Henley,\\n2005).\\nAlthough no one person is entirely responsible for starting the cognitive revolution, Noam Chomsky was very\\ninfluential in the early days of this movement (Figure 1.9). Chomsky (1928–), an American linguist, was\\ndissatisfied with the influence that behaviorism had had on psychology. He believed that psychology’s focus on\\nbehavior was short-sighted and that the field had to re-incorporate mental functioning into its purview if it\\nwere to offer any meaningful contributions to understanding behavior (Miller, 2003).\\nFIGURE 1.9 Noam Chomsky was very influential in beginning the cognitive revolution. In 2010, this mural honoring\\nhim was put up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (credit: Robert Moran)\\nEuropean psychology had never really been as influenced by behaviorism as had American psychology; and\\nthus, the cognitive revolution helped reestablish lines of communication between European psychologists and\\ntheir American counterparts. Furthermore, psychologists began to cooperate with scientists in other fields,\\nlike anthropology, linguistics, computer science, and neuroscience, among others. This interdisciplinary\\napproach often was referred to as the cognitive sciences, and the influence and prominence of this particular\\nperspective resonates in modern-day psychology (Miller, 2003).\\nFeminist Psychology\\nThe science of psychology has had an impact on human wellbeing, both positive and negative. The dominant\\ninfluence of Western, White, and male academics in the early history of psychology meant that psychology\\ndeveloped with the biases inherent in those individuals, which often had negative consequences for members of\\nsociety who were not White or male. Women, members of ethnic minorities in both the United States and other\\ncountries, and individuals with sexual orientations other than straight had difficulties entering the field of\\npsychology and therefore influencing its development. They also suffered from the attitudes of White male\\npsychologists who were not immune to the nonscientific attitudes prevalent in the society in which they\\nDIG DEEPER\\n16 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\ndeveloped and worked. Until the 1960s, the science of psychology was largely a “womanless” psychology\\n(Crawford & Marecek, 1989), meaning that few women were able to practice psychology, so they had little\\ninfluence on what was studied. In addition, the experimental subjects of psychology were mostly men, which\\nresulted from underlying assumptions that gender had no influence on psychology and that women were not of\\nsufficient interest to study.\\nAn article by Naomi Weisstein, first published in 1968 (Weisstein, 1993), stimulated a feminist revolution in\\npsychology by presenting a critique of psychology as a science. She also specifically criticized male psychologists\\nfor constructing the psychology of women entirely out of their own cultural biases and without careful\\nexperimental tests to verify any of their characterizations of women. Weisstein used, as examples, statements by\\nprominent psychologists in the 1960s, such as this quote by Bruno Bettleheim: “We must start with the\\nrealization that, as much as women want to be good scientists or engineers, they want first and foremost to be\\nwomanly companions of men and to be mothers.” Weisstein’s critique formed the foundation for the subsequent\\ndevelopment of a feminist psychology that attempted to be free of the influence of male cultural biases on our\\nknowledge of the psychology of women.\\nCrawford & Marecek (1989) identify several feminist approaches to psychology that can be described as feminist\\npsychology. These include re-evaluating and discovering the contributions of women to the history of psychology,\\nstudying psychological gender differences, and questioning the male bias present across the practice of the\\nscientific approach to knowledge.\\nMulticultural And Cross-Cultural Psychology\\nCulture impacts individuals, groups, and society. An ongoing issue researchers are trying to correct is that\\ncertain populations have been over-studied and the results of these studies have been applied to other\\npopulations. For example, Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan discuss how WEIRD societies have been\\noverstudied and the results have been wrongly applied to non-WEIRD societies (2010). WEIRD stands for\\nwestern, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic. Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan found that there are\\nmany differences between people in the WEIRD group and people in less industrialized, less urban, and non-\\nWestern societies. These differences occur in a variety of areas, including perception, cooperation, and moral\\nreasoning. That is, people vary depending on their culture and environment. Multicultural psychologists\\ndevelop theories and conduct research with diverse populations, typically within one country. Cross-cultural\\npsychologists compare populations across countries, such as participants from the United States compared to\\nparticipants from China.\\nIn 1920, Francis Cecil Sumner was the first African American to receive a PhD in psychology in the United\\nStates. Sumner established a psychology degree program at Howard University, leading to the education of a\\nnew generation of African American psychologists (Black, Spence, and Omari, 2004). Much of the work of early\\npsychologists from diverse backgrounds was dedicated to challenging intelligence testing and promoting\\ninnovative educational methods for children. George I. Sanchez contested such testing with Mexican American\\nchildren. As a psychologist of Mexican heritage, he pointed out that the language and cultural barriers in\\ntesting were keeping children from equal opportunities (Guthrie, 1998). By 1940, he was teaching with his\\ndoctoral degree at University of Texas at Austin and challenging segregated educational practices (Romo,\\n1986).\\nTwo famous African American researchers and psychologists are Mamie Phipps Clark and her husband,\\nKenneth Clark. They are best known for their studies conducted on African American children and doll\\npreference, research that was instrumental in the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court desegregation\\ncase. The Clarks applied their research to social services and opened the first child guidance center in Harlem\\n(American Psychological Association, 2019).\\nListen to the podcast below describing the Clarks\\' research and impact on the Supreme Court decision.\\n1.2 • History of Psychology 17\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nListen to a podcast about the influence of an African American\\'s psychology research on the historic Brown v.\\nBoard of Education civil rights case (http://openstax.org/l/crogers2) to learn more.\\nThe American Psychological Association has several ethnically based organizations for professional\\npsychologists that facilitate interactions among members. Since psychologists belonging to specific ethnic\\ngroups or cultures have the most interest in studying the psychology of their communities, these organizations\\nprovide an opportunity for the growth of research on the interplay between culture and psychology.\\nWOMEN IN PSYCHOLOGY\\nAlthough rarely given credit, women have been contributing to psychology since its inception as a field of\\nstudy. In 1894, Margaret Floy Washburn was the first woman awarded the doctoral degree in psychology. She\\nwrote The Animal Mind: A Textbook of Comparative Psychology, and it was the standard in the field for over 20\\nyears. In the mid 1890s, Mary Whiton Calkins completed all requirements toward the PhD in psychology, but\\nHarvard University refused to award her that degree because she was a woman. She had been taught and\\nmentored by William James, who tried and failed to convince Harvard to award her the doctoral degree. Her\\nmemory research studied primacy and recency (Madigan & O’Hara, 1992), and she also wrote about how\\nstructuralism and functionalism both explained self-psychology (Calkins, 1906).\\nAnother influential woman, Mary Cover Jones, conducted a study she considered to be a sequel to John B.\\nWatson’s study of Little Albert (you’ll learn about this study in the chapter on Learning). Jones unconditioned\\nfear in Little Peter, who had been afraid of rabbits (Jones, 1924).\\nEthnic minority women contributing to the field of psychology include Martha Bernal and Inez Beverly Prosser;\\ntheir studies were related to education. Bernal, the first Latina to earn her doctoral degree in psychology\\n(1962) conducted much of her research with Mexican American children. Prosser was the first African\\nAmerican woman awarded the PhD in 1933 at the University of Cincinnati (Benjamin, Henry, & McMahon,\\n2005).\\n1.3 Contemporary Psychology\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Appreciate the diversity of interests and foci within psychology\\n• Understand basic interests and applications in each of the described areas of psychology\\n• Demonstrate familiarity with some of the major concepts or important figures in each of the described areas of\\npsychology\\nContemporary psychology is a diverse field that is influenced by all of the historical perspectives described in\\nthe preceding section. Reflective of the discipline’s diversity is the diversity seen within the American\\nPsychological Association (APA). The APA is a professional organization representing psychologists in the\\nUnited States. The APA is the largest organization of psychologists in the world, and its mission is to advance\\nand disseminate psychological knowledge for the betterment of people. There are 54 divisions within the APA,\\nrepresenting a wide variety of specialties that range from Societies for the Psychology of Religion and\\nSpirituality to Exercise and Sport Psychology to Behavioral Neuroscience and Comparative Psychology.\\nReflecting the diversity of the field of psychology itself, members, affiliate members, and associate members\\nspan the spectrum from students to doctoral-level psychologists, and come from a variety of places including\\neducational settings, criminal justice, hospitals, the armed forces, and industry (American Psychological\\nAssociation, 2014). G. Stanley Hall was the first president of the APA. Before he earned his doctoral degree, he\\nwas an adjunct instructor at Wilberforce University, a historically Black college/university (HBCU), while\\nserving as faculty at Antioch College. Hall went on to work under William James, earning his PhD. Eventually,\\n18 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nhe became the first president of Clark University in Massachusetts when it was founded (Pickren & Rutherford,\\n2010).\\nThe Association for Psychological Science (APS) was founded in 1988 and seeks to advance the scientific\\norientation of psychology. Its founding resulted from disagreements between members of the scientific and\\nclinical branches of psychology within the APA. The APS publishes five research journals and engages in\\neducation and advocacy with funding agencies. A significant proportion of its members are international,\\nalthough the majority is located in the United States. Other organizations provide networking and\\ncollaboration opportunities for professionals of several ethnic or racial groups working in psychology, such as\\nthe National Latina/o Psychological Association (NLPA), the Asian American Psychological Association (AAPA),\\nthe Association of Black Psychologists (ABPsi), and the Society of Indian Psychologists (SIP). Most of these\\ngroups are also dedicated to studying psychological and social issues within their specific communities.\\nThis section will provide an overview of the major subdivisions within psychology today in the order in which\\nthey are introduced throughout the remainder of this textbook. This is not meant to be an exhaustive listing,\\nbut it will provide insight into the major areas of research and practice of modern-day psychologists.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nPlease visit this website about the divisions within the APA (http://openstax.org/l/biopsychology) to learn more.\\nView these student resources (http://openstax.org/l/studentresource) also provided by the APA.\\nBiopsychology and Evolutionary Psychology\\nAs the name suggests, biopsychology explores how our biology influences our behavior. While biological\\npsychology is a broad field, many biological psychologists want to understand how the structure and function\\nof the nervous system is related to behavior (Figure 1.10). As such, they often combine the research strategies\\nof both psychologists and physiologists to accomplish this goal (as discussed in Carlson, 2013).\\nFIGURE 1.10 Biological psychologists study how the structure and function of the nervous system generate\\nbehavior.\\nThe research interests of biological psychologists span a number of domains, including but not limited to,\\n1.3 • Contemporary Psychology 19\\nsensory and motor systems, sleep, drug use and abuse, ingestive behavior, reproductive behavior,\\nneurodevelopment, plasticity of the nervous system, and biological correlates of psychological disorders.\\nGiven the broad areas of interest falling under the purview of biological psychology, it will probably come as no\\nsurprise that individuals from all sorts of backgrounds are involved in this research, including biologists,\\nmedical professionals, physiologists, and chemists. This interdisciplinary approach is often referred to as\\nneuroscience, of which biological psychology is a component (Carlson, 2013).\\nWhile biopsychology typically focuses on the immediate causes of behavior based in the physiology of a\\nhuman or other animal, evolutionary psychology seeks to study the ultimate biological causes of behavior. To\\nthe extent that a behavior is impacted by genetics, a behavior, like any anatomical characteristic of a human or\\nanimal, will demonstrate adaption to its surroundings. These surroundings include the physical environment\\nand, since interactions between organisms can be important to survival and reproduction, the social\\nenvironment. The study of behavior in the context of evolution has its origins with Charles Darwin, the co-\\ndiscoverer of the theory of evolution by natural selection. Darwin was well aware that behaviors should be\\nadaptive and wrote books titled, The Descent of Man (1871) and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and\\nAnimals (1872), to explore this field.\\nEvolutionary psychology, and specifically, the evolutionary psychology of humans, has enjoyed a resurgence in\\nrecent decades. To be subject to evolution by natural selection, a behavior must have a significant genetic\\ncause. In general, we expect all human cultures to express a behavior if it is caused genetically, since the\\ngenetic differences among human groups are small. The approach taken by most evolutionary psychologists is\\nto predict the outcome of a behavior in a particular situation based on evolutionary theory and then to make\\nobservations, or conduct experiments, to determine whether the results match the theory. It is important to\\nrecognize that these types of studies are not strong evidence that a behavior is adaptive, since they lack\\ninformation that the behavior is in some part genetic and not entirely cultural (Endler, 1986). Demonstrating\\nthat a trait, especially in humans, is naturally selected is extraordinarily difficult; perhaps for this reason,\\nsome evolutionary psychologists are content to assume the behaviors they study have genetic determinants\\n(Confer et al., 2010).\\nOne other drawback of evolutionary psychology is that the traits that we possess now evolved under\\nenvironmental and social conditions far back in human history, and we have a poor understanding of what\\nthese conditions were. This makes predictions about what is adaptive for a behavior difficult. Behavioral traits\\nneed not be adaptive under current conditions, only under the conditions of the past when they evolved, about\\nwhich we can only hypothesize.\\nThere are many areas of human behavior for which evolution can make predictions. Examples include\\nmemory, mate choice, relationships between kin, friendship and cooperation, parenting, social organization,\\nand status (Confer et al., 2010).\\nEvolutionary psychologists have had success in finding experimental correspondence between observations\\nand expectations. In one example, in a study of mate preference differences between men and women that\\nspanned 37 cultures, Buss (1989) found that women valued earning potential factors greater than men, and\\nmen valued potential reproductive factors (youth and attractiveness) greater than women in their prospective\\nmates. In general, the predictions were in line with the predictions of evolution, although there were deviations\\nin some cultures.\\nSensation and Perception\\nScientists interested in both physiological aspects of sensory systems as well as in the psychological\\nexperience of sensory information work within the area of sensation and perception (Figure 1.11). As such,\\nsensation and perception research is also quite interdisciplinary. Imagine walking between buildings as you\\nmove from one class to another. You are inundated with sights, sounds, touch sensations, and smells. You also\\nexperience the temperature of the air around you and maintain your balance as you make your way. These are\\n20 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nall factors of interest to someone working in the domain of sensation and perception.\\nFIGURE 1.11 When you look at this image, you may see a duck or a rabbit. The sensory information remains the\\nsame, but your perception can vary dramatically.\\nAs described in a later chapter that focuses on the results of studies in sensation and perception, our\\nexperience of our world is not as simple as the sum total of all of the sensory information (or sensations)\\ntogether. Rather, our experience (or perception) is complex and is influenced by where we focus our attention,\\nour previous experiences, and even our cultural backgrounds.\\nCognitive Psychology\\nAs mentioned in the previous section, the cognitive revolution created an impetus for psychologists to focus\\ntheir attention on better understanding the mind and mental processes that underlie behavior. Thus, cognitive\\npsychology is the area of psychology that focuses on studying cognitions, or thoughts, and their relationship to\\nour experiences and our actions. Like biological psychology, cognitive psychology is broad in its scope and\\noften involves collaborations among people from a diverse range of disciplinary backgrounds. This has led\\nsome to coin the term cognitive science to describe the interdisciplinary nature of this area of research (Miller,\\n2003).\\nCognitive psychologists have research interests that span a spectrum of topics, ranging from attention to\\nproblem solving to language to memory. The approaches used in studying these topics are equally diverse.\\nGiven such diversity, cognitive psychology is not captured in one chapter of this text per se; rather, various\\nconcepts related to cognitive psychology will be covered in relevant portions of the chapters in this text on\\nsensation and perception, thinking and intelligence, memory, lifespan development, social psychology, and\\ntherapy.\\nDevelopmental Psychology\\nDevelopmental psychology is the scientific study of development across a lifespan. Developmental\\npsychologists are interested in processes related to physical maturation. However, their focus is not limited to\\nthe physical changes associated with aging, as they also focus on changes in cognitive skills, moral reasoning,\\nsocial behavior, and other psychological attributes.\\nEarly developmental psychologists focused primarily on changes that occurred through reaching adulthood,\\nproviding enormous insight into the differences in physical, cognitive, and social capacities that exist between\\nvery young children and adults. For instance, research by Jean Piaget (Figure 1.12) demonstrated that very\\nyoung children do not demonstrate object permanence. Object permanence refers to the understanding that\\nphysical things continue to exist, even if they are hidden from us. If you were to show an adult a toy, and then\\nhide it behind a curtain, the adult knows that the toy still exists. However, very young infants act as if a hidden\\nobject no longer exists. The age at which object permanence is achieved is somewhat controversial (Munakata,\\nMcClelland, Johnson, and Siegler, 1997).\\n1.3 • Contemporary Psychology 21\\nFIGURE 1.12 Jean Piaget is famous for his theories regarding changes in cognitive ability that occur as we move\\nfrom infancy to adulthood.\\nWhile Piaget was focused on cognitive changes during infancy and childhood as we move to adulthood, there is\\nan increasing interest in extending research into the changes that occur much later in life. This may be\\nreflective of changing population demographics of developed nations as a whole. As more and more people live\\nlonger lives, the number of people of advanced age will continue to increase. Indeed, it is estimated that there\\nwere just over 40 million people aged 65 or older living in the United States in 2010. However, by 2020, this\\nnumber is expected to increase to about 55 million. By the year 2050, it is estimated that nearly 90 million\\npeople in this country will be 65 or older (Department of Health and Human Services, n.d.).\\nPersonality Psychology\\nPersonality psychology focuses on patterns of thoughts and behaviors that make each individual unique.\\nSeveral individuals (e.g., Freud and Maslow) that we have already discussed in our historical overview of\\npsychology, and the American psychologist Gordon Allport, contributed to early theories of personality. These\\nearly theorists attempted to explain how an individual’s personality develops from their given perspective. For\\nexample, Freud proposed that personality arose as conflicts between the conscious and unconscious parts of\\nthe mind were carried out over the lifespan. Specifically, Freud theorized that an individual went through\\nvarious psychosexual stages of development. According to Freud, adult personality would result from the\\nresolution of various conflicts that centered on the migration of erogenous (or sexual pleasure-producing)\\nzones from the oral (mouth) to the anus to the phallus to the genitals. Like many of Freud’s theories, this\\nparticular idea was controversial and did not lend itself to experimental tests (Person, 1980).\\nMore recently, the study of personality has taken on a more quantitative approach. Rather than explaining how\\npersonality arises, research is focused on identifying personality traits, measuring these traits, and\\ndetermining how these traits interact in a particular context to determine how a person will behave in any\\ngiven situation. Personality traits are relatively consistent patterns of thought and behavior, and many have\\nproposed that five trait dimensions are sufficient to capture the variations in personality seen across\\nindividuals. These five dimensions are known as the “Big Five” or the Five Factor model, and include\\ndimensions of conscientiousness, agreeableness, neuroticism, openness, and extraversion (Figure 1.13). Each\\nof these traits has been demonstrated to be relatively stable over the lifespan (e.g., Rantanen, Metsäpelto, Feldt,\\nPulkinnen, and Kokko, 2007; Soldz & Vaillant, 1999; McCrae & Costa, 2008) and is influenced by genetics (e.g.,\\nJang, Livesly, and Vernon, 1996).\\n22 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nFIGURE 1.13 Each of the dimensions of the Five Factor model is shown in this figure. The provided description\\nwould describe someone who scored highly on that given dimension. Someone with a lower score on a given\\ndimension could be described in opposite terms.\\nSocial Psychology\\nSocial psychology focuses on how we interact with and relate to others. Social psychologists conduct research\\non a wide variety of topics that include differences in how we explain our own behavior versus how we explain\\nthe behaviors of others, prejudice, and attraction, and how we resolve interpersonal conflicts. Social\\npsychologists have also sought to determine how being among other people changes our own behavior and\\npatterns of thinking.\\nThere are many interesting examples of social psychological research, and you will read about many of these\\nin a later chapter of this textbook. Until then, you will be introduced to one of the most controversial\\npsychological studies ever conducted. Stanley Milgram was an American social psychologist who is most\\nfamous for research that he conducted on obedience. After the holocaust, in 1961, a Nazi war criminal, Adolf\\nEichmann, who was accused of committing mass atrocities, was put on trial. Many people wondered how\\nGerman soldiers were capable of torturing prisoners in concentration camps, and they were unsatisfied with\\nthe excuses given by soldiers that they were simply following orders. At the time, most psychologists agreed\\nthat few people would be willing to inflict such extraordinary pain and suffering, simply because they were\\nobeying orders. Milgram decided to conduct research to determine whether or not this was true (Figure 1.14).\\nAs you will read later in the text, Milgram found that nearly two-thirds of his participants were willing to\\ndeliver what they believed to be lethal shocks to another person, simply because they were instructed to do so\\nby an authority figure (in this case, a man dressed in a lab coat). This was in spite of the fact that participants\\n1.3 • Contemporary Psychology 23\\nthen, that individuals earning bachelor’s degrees in psychology find themselves in a number of different\\ncareers, as shown in Table 1.1. Examples of a few such careers can involve serving as case managers, working\\nin sales, working in human resource departments, and teaching in high schools. The rapidly growing realm of\\nhealthcare professions is another field in which an education in psychology is helpful and sometimes required.\\nFor example, the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) exam that people must take to be admitted to medical\\nschool now includes a section on the psychological foundations of behavior.\\nTop Occupations Employing Graduates with a BA in Psychology (Fogg, Harrington, Harrington, & Shatkin,\\n2012)\\nRanking Occupation\\n1 Mid- and top-level management (executive, administrator)\\n2 Sales\\n3 Social work\\n4 Other management positions\\n5 Human resources (personnel, training)\\n6 Other administrative positions\\n7 Insurance, real estate, business\\n8 Marketing and sales\\n9 Healthcare (nurse, pharmacist, therapist)\\n10 Finance (accountant, auditor)\\nTABLE 1.1\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nThe APA provides career information (http://openstax.org/l/careers) about various areas of psychology.\\n1.4 • Careers in Psychology 29\\nKey Terms\\nAmerican Psychological Association (APA) professional organization representing psychologists in the\\nUnited States\\nbehaviorism focus on observing and controlling behavior\\nbiopsychology study of how biology influences behavior\\nbiopsychosocial model perspective that asserts that biology, psychology, and social factors interact to\\ndetermine an individual’s health\\nclinical psychology area of psychology that focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of psychological disorders\\nand other problematic patterns of behavior\\ncognitive psychology study of cognitions, or thoughts, and their relationship to experiences and actions\\ncounseling psychology area of psychology that focuses on improving emotional, social, vocational, and other\\naspects of the lives of psychologically healthy individuals\\ndevelopmental psychology scientific study of development across a lifespan\\ndissertation long research paper about research that was conducted as a part of the candidate’s doctoral\\ntraining\\nempirical method method for acquiring knowledge based on observation, including experimentation, rather\\nthan a method based only on forms of logical argument or previous authorities\\nforensic psychology area of psychology that applies the science and practice of psychology to issues within\\nand related to the justice system\\nfunctionalism focused on how mental activities helped an organism adapt to its environment\\nhumanism perspective within psychology that emphasizes the potential for good that is innate to all humans\\nintrospection process by which someone examines their own conscious experience in an attempt to break it\\ninto its component parts\\nology suffix that denotes “scientific study of”\\npersonality psychology study of patterns of thoughts and behaviors that make each individual unique\\npersonality trait consistent pattern of thought and behavior\\nPhD (doctor of philosophy) doctoral degree conferred in many disciplinary perspectives housed in a\\ntraditional college of liberal arts and sciences\\npostdoctoral training program allows young scientists to further develop their research programs and\\nbroaden their research skills under the supervision of other professionals in the field\\npsychoanalytic theory focus on the role of the unconscious in affecting conscious behavior\\npsychology scientific study of the mind and behavior\\nPsyD (doctor of psychology) doctoral degree that places less emphasis on research-oriented skills and focuses\\nmore on application of psychological principles in the clinical context\\nsport and exercise psychology area of psychology that focuses on the interactions between mental and\\nemotional factors and physical performance in sports, exercise, and other activities\\nstructuralism understanding the conscious experience through introspection\\nSummary\\n1.1 What Is Psychology?\\nPsychology is defined as the scientific study of mind and behavior. Students of psychology develop critical\\nthinking skills, become familiar with the scientific method, and recognize the complexity of behavior.\\n1.2 History of Psychology\\nBefore the time of Wundt and James, questions about the mind were considered by philosophers. However,\\nboth Wundt and James helped create psychology as a distinct scientific discipline. Wundt was a structuralist,\\nwhich meant he believed that our cognitive experience was best understood by breaking that experience into\\nits component parts. He thought this was best accomplished by introspection.\\n30 1 • Key Terms\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nWilliam James was the first American psychologist, and he was a proponent of functionalism. This particular\\nperspective focused on how mental activities served as adaptive responses to an organism’s environment. Like\\nWundt, James also relied on introspection; however, his research approach also incorporated more objective\\nmeasures as well.\\nSigmund Freud believed that understanding the unconscious mind was absolutely critical to understand\\nconscious behavior. This was especially true for individuals that he saw who suffered from various hysterias\\nand neuroses. Freud relied on dream analysis, slips of the tongue, and free association as means to access the\\nunconscious. Psychoanalytic theory remained a dominant force in clinical psychology for several decades.\\nGestalt psychology was very influential in Europe. Gestalt psychology takes a holistic view of an individual and\\nhis experiences. As the Nazis came to power in Germany, Wertheimer, Koffka, and Köhler immigrated to the\\nUnited States. Although they left their laboratories and their research behind, they did introduce America to\\nGestalt ideas. Some of the principles of Gestalt psychology are still very influential in the study of sensation\\nand perception.\\nOne of the most influential schools of thought within psychology’s history was behaviorism. Behaviorism\\nfocused on making psychology an objective science by studying overt behavior and deemphasizing the\\nimportance of unobservable mental processes. John Watson is often considered the father of behaviorism, and\\nB. F. Skinner’s contributions to our understanding of principles of operant conditioning cannot be\\nunderestimated.\\nAs behaviorism and psychoanalytic theory took hold of so many aspects of psychology, some began to become\\ndissatisfied with psychology’s picture of human nature. Thus, a humanistic movement within psychology\\nbegan to take hold. Humanism focuses on the potential of all people for good. Both Maslow and Rogers were\\ninfluential in shaping humanistic psychology.\\nDuring the 1950s, the landscape of psychology began to change. A science of behavior began to shift back to its\\nroots of focus on mental processes. The emergence of neuroscience and computer science aided this\\ntransition. Ultimately, the cognitive revolution took hold, and people came to realize that cognition was crucial\\nto a true appreciation and understanding of behavior.\\n1.3 Contemporary Psychology\\nPsychology is a diverse discipline that is made up of several major subdivisions with unique perspectives.\\nBiological psychology involves the study of the biological bases of behavior. Sensation and perception refer to\\nthe area of psychology that is focused on how information from our sensory modalities is received, and how\\nthis information is transformed into our perceptual experiences of the world around us. Cognitive psychology\\nis concerned with the relationship that exists between thought and behavior, and developmental psychologists\\nstudy the physical and cognitive changes that occur throughout one’s lifespan. Personality psychology focuses\\non individuals’ unique patterns of behavior, thought, and emotion. Industrial and organizational psychology,\\nhealth psychology, sport and exercise psychology, forensic psychology, and clinical psychology are all\\nconsidered applied areas of psychology. Industrial and organizational psychologists apply psychological\\nconcepts to I-O settings. Health psychologists look for ways to help people live healthier lives, and clinical\\npsychology involves the diagnosis and treatment of psychological disorders and other problematic behavioral\\npatterns. Sport and exercise psychologists study the interactions between thoughts, emotions, and physical\\nperformance in sports, exercise, and other activities. Forensic psychologists carry out activities related to\\npsychology in association with the justice system.\\n1.4 Careers in Psychology\\nGenerally, academic careers in psychology require doctoral degrees. However, there are a number of\\nnonacademic career options for people who have master’s degrees in psychology.

Plain text, no Markdown. Answer only, no other questions. Context: The Skinner box is a chamber that isolates the subject from the external environment and has a behavior indicator such as a lever or a button. When the animal pushes the button or lever, the box is able to deliver a positive reinforcement of the behavior (such as food) or a punishment (such as a noise). Skinner’s focus on positive and negative reinforcement of learned behaviors had a lasting influence in psychology that has waned somewhat since the growth of research in cognitive psychology. Despite this, conditioned learning is still used in human behavioral modification (Greengrass, 2004). Maslow, Rogers, and Humanism During the early 20th century, American psychology was dominated by behaviorism and psychoanalysis. However, some psychologists were uncomfortable with what they viewed as limited perspectives being so influential to the field. They objected to the pessimism and determinism (all actions driven by the unconscious) of Freud. They also disliked the reductionism, or simplifying nature, of behaviorism. Behaviorism is also deterministic at its core, because it sees human behavior as entirely determined by a combination of genetics and environment. Some psychologists began to form their own ideas that emphasized personal control, intentionality, and a true predisposition for “good” as important for our self-concept and our behavior. Thus, humanism emerged. Humanism is a perspective within psychology that emphasizes the potential for good that is innate to all humans. Two of the most well-known proponents of humanistic psychology are Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers (O’Hara, n.d.). Abraham Maslow (1908–1970) was an American psychologist who is best known for proposing a hierarchy of human needs in motivating behavior (Figure 1.7). Although this concept will be discussed in more detail in a later chapter, a brief overview will be provided here. Maslow asserted that so long as basic needs necessary for survival were met (e.g., food, water, shelter), higher-level needs (e.g., social needs) would begin to motivate behavior. According to Maslow, the highest-level needs relate to self-actualization, a process by which we achieve our full potential as human beings. In other words, we strive to become the best version of ourselves that we are capable of becoming. This process of self-realization is what motivates us to pursue our goals and accomplish our life’s purpose. The higher the level of need that a person is motivated to meet (i.e., the higher the “hierarchy” of needs), the more likely it is that he or she will act on that need. For example, if someone is motivated to fulfill their need for love and belonging, they are likely to seek out a romantic partner. If they are not motivated by this need, then they may not pursue romantic relationships. Similarly, someone motivated by the need to be respected and valued will likely avoid relationships with people who do not meet their needs. However, this does not mean that they will avoid all relationships altogether. Rather, it means that they will only pursue relationships in which they feel valued and respected. The concept of motivation has been a topic of debate among psychologists for many years. There are several theories that have been proposed to explain the relationship between motivation and behavior. One of these theories is known as the dual-process theory, which posits that there are two types of processes involved in motivation: the automatic process and the deliberate process. Automatic processes are those processes that occur without conscious thought or effort, while deliberate processes occur with conscious thought and effort. These processes can be further divided into two categories: goal-directed and task directed processes. Goal-directed processes refer to those processes that are focused on achieving a specific goal or objective, whereas task directed processes involve the pursuit of a task or activity. It is important to note that these categories are not mutually exclusive, as some processes may be a combination of both goal and task-oriented processes. Goal- and Task- Oriented Processes Goal-Oriented Process A goal-oriented process is one that involves an individual’s desire to achieve a particular goal or objective. Examples of goal-orientated processes include: • Pursuing a hobby or interest • Completing a project or task at work or school Task- oriented processes, on the other hand, involve activities or tasks that individuals engage in in order to achieve their goals or objectives. Tasks can range from simple to complex, depending on their nature. Examples of tasks include completing a math problem, solving a puzzle, performing a physical activity, or working on a creative project.

While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember\\nwhat he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is\\nassociated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend’s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John\\nNash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would\\ntell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended\\nfor him. He also began to hear voices and became suspicious of the people around him. Soon thereafter, Nash\\nwas diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a state-run mental institution (O’Connor & Robertson,\\n1Introduction to Psychology\\n2002). Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these\\nexperiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain’s internal\\nprocesses and people’s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of\\npsychology has explored these questions.\\n1.1 What Is Psychology?\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Define psychology\\n• Understand the merits of an education in psychology\\nWhat is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology\\nexplores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists\\nuse the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question\\nabout how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the\\nphenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or\\ngroup of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over\\ntime. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes\\nobservations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then\\npublished or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.\\nScientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because\\nit is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We\\nmust ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However,\\nwe can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus,\\npsychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.\\nIn general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot\\narrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the\\nmind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific\\nmethod is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on\\nobservation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or\\nprevious authorities.\\nIt was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this\\ntime, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is,\\nat its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological\\norganism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore,\\npsychology is also a social science.\\nWHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?\\nOften, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to\\nlearn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course\\nbecause it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as\\nnursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare\\npsychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses\\nacross the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology\\nmajors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook’s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality\\nand political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About\\n6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S.\\nDepartment of Education, 2016).\\n8 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nAn education in psychology is valuable for a number of reasons. Psychology students hone critical thinking\\nskills and are trained in the use of the scientific method. Critical thinking is the active application of a set of\\nskills to information for the understanding and evaluation of that information. The evaluation of\\ninformation—assessing its reliability and usefulness— is an important skill in a world full of competing “facts,”\\nmany of which are designed to be misleading. For example, critical thinking involves maintaining an attitude\\nof skepticism, recognizing internal biases, making use of logical thinking, asking appropriate questions, and\\nmaking observations. Psychology students also can develop better communication skills during the course of\\ntheir undergraduate coursework (American Psychological Association, 2011). Together, these factors increase\\nstudents’ scientific literacy and prepare students to critically evaluate the various sources of information they\\nencounter.\\nIn addition to these broad-based skills, psychology students come to understand the complex factors that\\nshape one’s behavior. They appreciate the interaction of our biology, our environment, and our experiences in\\ndetermining who we are and how we will behave. They learn about basic principles that guide how we think\\nand behave, and they come to recognize the tremendous diversity that exists across individuals and across\\ncultural boundaries (American Psychological Association, 2011).\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nWatch a brief video about some questions to consider before deciding to major in psychology\\n(http://openstax.org/l/psycmajor) to learn more.\\n1.2 History of Psychology\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Understand the importance of Wundt and James in the development of psychology\\n• Appreciate Freud’s influence on psychology\\n• Understand the basic tenets of Gestalt psychology\\n• Appreciate the important role that behaviorism played in psychology’s history\\n• Understand basic tenets of humanism\\n• Understand how the cognitive revolution shifted psychology’s focus back to the mind\\nPsychology is a relatively young science with its experimental roots in the 19th century, compared, for\\nexample, to human physiology, which dates much earlier. As mentioned, anyone interested in exploring issues\\nrelated to the mind generally did so in a philosophical context prior to the 19th century. Two 19th century\\nscholars, Wilhelm Wundt and William James, are generally credited as being the founders of psychology as a\\nscience and academic discipline that was distinct from philosophy. This section will provide an overview of the\\nshifts in paradigms that have influenced psychology from Wundt and James through today.\\nWundt and Structuralism\\nWilhelm Wundt (1832–1920) was a German scientist who was the first person to be referred to as a\\npsychologist. His famous book entitled Principles of Physiological Psychology was published in 1873. Wundt\\nviewed psychology as a scientific study of conscious experience, and he believed that the goal of psychology\\nwas to identify components of consciousness and how those components combined to result in our conscious\\nexperience. Wundt used introspection (he called it “internal perception”), a process by which someone\\nexamines their own conscious experience as objectively as possible, making the human mind like any other\\naspect of nature that a scientist observed. He believed in the notion of voluntarism—that people have free will\\nand should know the intentions of a psychological experiment if they were participating (Danziger, 1980).\\nWundt considered his version experimental introspection; he used instruments such as those that measured\\nreaction time. He also wrote Volkerpsychologie in 1904 in which he suggested that psychology should include\\nthe study of culture, as it involves the study of people. Edward Titchener, one of his students, went on to\\n1.2 • History of Psychology 9\\ndevelop structuralism. Its focus was on the contents of mental processes rather than their function (Pickren &\\nRutherford, 2010). Wundt established his psychology laboratory at the University at Leipzig in 1879 (Figure\\n1.2). In this laboratory, Wundt and his students conducted experiments on, for example, reaction times. A\\nsubject, sometimes in a room isolated from the scientist, would receive a stimulus such as a light, image, or\\nsound. The subject’s reaction to the stimulus would be to push a button, and an apparatus would record the\\ntime to reaction. Wundt could measure reaction time to one-thousandth of a second (Nicolas & Ferrand, 1999).\\nFIGURE 1.2 (a) Wilhelm Wundt is credited as one of the founders of psychology. He created the first laboratory for\\npsychological research. (b) This photo shows him seated and surrounded by fellow researchers and equipment in\\nhis laboratory in Germany.\\nHowever, despite his efforts to train individuals in the process of introspection, this process remained highly\\nsubjective, and there was very little agreement between individuals.\\nFunctionalism\\nWilliam James, John Dewey, and Charles Sanders Peirce helped establish functional psychology (Figure 1.3).\\nThey accepted Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection and viewed this theory as an explanation of an\\norganism’s characteristics. Key to that theory is the idea that natural selection leads to organisms that are\\nadapted to their environment, including their behavior. Adaptation means that a trait of an organism has a\\nfunction for the survival and reproduction of the individual, because it has been naturally selected. As James\\nsaw it, psychology’s purpose was to study the function of behavior in the world, and as such, his perspective\\nwas known as functionalism. Functionalism focused on how mental activities helped an organism fit into its\\nenvironment. Functionalism has a second, more subtle meaning in that functionalists were more interested in\\nthe operation of the whole mind rather than of its individual parts, which were the focus of structuralism. Like\\nWundt, James believed that introspection could serve as one means by which someone might study mental\\nactivities, but James also relied on more objective measures, including the use of various recording devices,\\nand examinations of concrete products of mental activities and of anatomy and physiology (Gordon, 1995).\\n10 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nThe Skinner box is a chamber that isolates the subject from the external environment and has a behavior\\nindicator such as a lever or a button. When the animal pushes the button or lever, the box is able to deliver a\\npositive reinforcement of the behavior (such as food) or a punishment (such as a noise).\\nSkinner’s focus on positive and negative reinforcement of learned behaviors had a lasting influence in\\npsychology that has waned somewhat since the growth of research in cognitive psychology. Despite this,\\nconditioned learning is still used in human behavioral modification (Greengrass, 2004).\\nMaslow, Rogers, and Humanism\\nDuring the early 20th century, American psychology was dominated by behaviorism and psychoanalysis.\\nHowever, some psychologists were uncomfortable with what they viewed as limited perspectives being so\\ninfluential to the field. They objected to the pessimism and determinism (all actions driven by the\\nunconscious) of Freud. They also disliked the reductionism, or simplifying nature, of behaviorism.\\nBehaviorism is also deterministic at its core, because it sees human behavior as entirely determined by a\\ncombination of genetics and environment. Some psychologists began to form their own ideas that emphasized\\npersonal control, intentionality, and a true predisposition for “good” as important for our self-concept and our\\nbehavior. Thus, humanism emerged. Humanism is a perspective within psychology that emphasizes the\\npotential for good that is innate to all humans. Two of the most well-known proponents of humanistic\\npsychology are Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers (O’Hara, n.d.).\\nAbraham Maslow (1908–1970) was an American psychologist who is best known for proposing a hierarchy of\\nhuman needs in motivating behavior (Figure 1.7). Although this concept will be discussed in more detail in a\\nlater chapter, a brief overview will be provided here. Maslow asserted that so long as basic needs necessary for\\nsurvival were met (e.g., food, water, shelter), higher-level needs (e.g., social needs) would begin to motivate\\nbehavior. According to Maslow, the highest-level needs relate to self-actualization, a process by which we\\nachieve our full potential. Obviously, the focus on the positive aspects of human nature that are characteristic\\nof the humanistic perspective is evident (Thorne & Henley, 2005). Humanistic psychologists rejected, on\\nprinciple, the research approach based on reductionist experimentation in the tradition of the physical and\\nbiological sciences, because it missed the “whole” human being. Beginning with Maslow and Rogers, there was\\nan insistence on a humanistic research program. This program has been largely qualitative (not\\nmeasurement-based), but there exist a number of quantitative research strains within humanistic psychology,\\nincluding research on happiness, self-concept, meditation, and the outcomes of humanistic psychotherapy\\n(Friedman, 2008).\\n14 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nFIGURE 1.7 Maslow’s hierarchy of needs is shown.\\nCarl Rogers (1902–1987) was also an American psychologist who, like Maslow, emphasized the potential for\\ngood that exists within all people (Figure 1.8). Rogers used a therapeutic technique known as client-centered\\ntherapy in helping his clients deal with problematic issues that resulted in their seeking psychotherapy. Unlike\\na psychoanalytic approach in which the therapist plays an important role in interpreting what conscious\\nbehavior reveals about the unconscious mind, client-centered therapy involves the patient taking a lead role in\\nthe therapy session. Rogers believed that a therapist needed to display three features to maximize the\\neffectiveness of this particular approach: unconditional positive regard, genuineness, and empathy.\\nUnconditional positive regard refers to the fact that the therapist accepts their client for who they are, no\\nmatter what they might say. Provided these factors, Rogers believed that people were more than capable of\\ndealing with and working through their own issues (Thorne & Henley, 2005).\\nFIGURE 1.8 Carl Rogers, shown in this portrait, developed a client-centered therapy method that has been\\ninfluential in clinical settings. (credit: \"Didius\"/Wikimedia Commons)\\nHumanism has been influential to psychology as a whole. Both Maslow and Rogers are well-known names\\namong students of psychology (you will read more about both later in this text), and their ideas have influenced\\nmany scholars. Furthermore, Rogers’ client-centered approach to therapy is still commonly used in\\npsychotherapeutic settings today (O’hara, n.d.)\\n1.2 • History of Psychology 15\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nView a brief video of Carl Rogers describing his therapeutic approach (http://openstax.org/l/crogers1) to learn\\nmore.\\nThe Cognitive Revolution\\nBehaviorism’s emphasis on objectivity and focus on external behavior had pulled psychologists’ attention away\\nfrom the mind for a prolonged period of time. The early work of the humanistic psychologists redirected\\nattention to the individual human as a whole, and as a conscious and self-aware being. By the 1950s, new\\ndisciplinary perspectives in linguistics, neuroscience, and computer science were emerging, and these areas\\nrevived interest in the mind as a focus of scientific inquiry. This particular perspective has come to be known\\nas the cognitive revolution (Miller, 2003). By 1967, Ulric Neisser published the first textbook entitled Cognitive\\nPsychology, which served as a core text in cognitive psychology courses around the country (Thorne & Henley,\\n2005).\\nAlthough no one person is entirely responsible for starting the cognitive revolution, Noam Chomsky was very\\ninfluential in the early days of this movement (Figure 1.9). Chomsky (1928–), an American linguist, was\\ndissatisfied with the influence that behaviorism had had on psychology. He believed that psychology’s focus on\\nbehavior was short-sighted and that the field had to re-incorporate mental functioning into its purview if it\\nwere to offer any meaningful contributions to understanding behavior (Miller, 2003).\\nFIGURE 1.9 Noam Chomsky was very influential in beginning the cognitive revolution. In 2010, this mural honoring\\nhim was put up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (credit: Robert Moran)\\nEuropean psychology had never really been as influenced by behaviorism as had American psychology; and\\nthus, the cognitive revolution helped reestablish lines of communication between European psychologists and\\ntheir American counterparts. Furthermore, psychologists began to cooperate with scientists in other fields,\\nlike anthropology, linguistics, computer science, and neuroscience, among others. This interdisciplinary\\napproach often was referred to as the cognitive sciences, and the influence and prominence of this particular\\nperspective resonates in modern-day psychology (Miller, 2003).\\nFeminist Psychology\\nThe science of psychology has had an impact on human wellbeing, both positive and negative. The dominant\\ninfluence of Western, White, and male academics in the early history of psychology meant that psychology\\ndeveloped with the biases inherent in those individuals, which often had negative consequences for members of\\nsociety who were not White or male. Women, members of ethnic minorities in both the United States and other\\ncountries, and individuals with sexual orientations other than straight had difficulties entering the field of\\npsychology and therefore influencing its development. They also suffered from the attitudes of White male\\npsychologists who were not immune to the nonscientific attitudes prevalent in the society in which they\\nDIG DEEPER\\n16 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\ndeveloped and worked. Until the 1960s, the science of psychology was largely a “womanless” psychology\\n(Crawford & Marecek, 1989), meaning that few women were able to practice psychology, so they had little\\ninfluence on what was studied. In addition, the experimental subjects of psychology were mostly men, which\\nresulted from underlying assumptions that gender had no influence on psychology and that women were not of\\nsufficient interest to study.\\nAn article by Naomi Weisstein, first published in 1968 (Weisstein, 1993), stimulated a feminist revolution in\\npsychology by presenting a critique of psychology as a science. She also specifically criticized male psychologists\\nfor constructing the psychology of women entirely out of their own cultural biases and without careful\\nexperimental tests to verify any of their characterizations of women. Weisstein used, as examples, statements by\\nprominent psychologists in the 1960s, such as this quote by Bruno Bettleheim: “We must start with the\\nrealization that, as much as women want to be good scientists or engineers, they want first and foremost to be\\nwomanly companions of men and to be mothers.” Weisstein’s critique formed the foundation for the subsequent\\ndevelopment of a feminist psychology that attempted to be free of the influence of male cultural biases on our\\nknowledge of the psychology of women.\\nCrawford & Marecek (1989) identify several feminist approaches to psychology that can be described as feminist\\npsychology. These include re-evaluating and discovering the contributions of women to the history of psychology,\\nstudying psychological gender differences, and questioning the male bias present across the practice of the\\nscientific approach to knowledge.\\nMulticultural And Cross-Cultural Psychology\\nCulture impacts individuals, groups, and society. An ongoing issue researchers are trying to correct is that\\ncertain populations have been over-studied and the results of these studies have been applied to other\\npopulations. For example, Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan discuss how WEIRD societies have been\\noverstudied and the results have been wrongly applied to non-WEIRD societies (2010). WEIRD stands for\\nwestern, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic. Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan found that there are\\nmany differences between people in the WEIRD group and people in less industrialized, less urban, and non-\\nWestern societies. These differences occur in a variety of areas, including perception, cooperation, and moral\\nreasoning. That is, people vary depending on their culture and environment. Multicultural psychologists\\ndevelop theories and conduct research with diverse populations, typically within one country. Cross-cultural\\npsychologists compare populations across countries, such as participants from the United States compared to\\nparticipants from China.\\nIn 1920, Francis Cecil Sumner was the first African American to receive a PhD in psychology in the United\\nStates. Sumner established a psychology degree program at Howard University, leading to the education of a\\nnew generation of African American psychologists (Black, Spence, and Omari, 2004). Much of the work of early\\npsychologists from diverse backgrounds was dedicated to challenging intelligence testing and promoting\\ninnovative educational methods for children. George I. Sanchez contested such testing with Mexican American\\nchildren. As a psychologist of Mexican heritage, he pointed out that the language and cultural barriers in\\ntesting were keeping children from equal opportunities (Guthrie, 1998). By 1940, he was teaching with his\\ndoctoral degree at University of Texas at Austin and challenging segregated educational practices (Romo,\\n1986).\\nTwo famous African American researchers and psychologists are Mamie Phipps Clark and her husband,\\nKenneth Clark. They are best known for their studies conducted on African American children and doll\\npreference, research that was instrumental in the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court desegregation\\ncase. The Clarks applied their research to social services and opened the first child guidance center in Harlem\\n(American Psychological Association, 2019).\\nListen to the podcast below describing the Clarks\\' research and impact on the Supreme Court decision.\\n1.2 • History of Psychology 17\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nListen to a podcast about the influence of an African American\\'s psychology research on the historic Brown v.\\nBoard of Education civil rights case (http://openstax.org/l/crogers2) to learn more.\\nThe American Psychological Association has several ethnically based organizations for professional\\npsychologists that facilitate interactions among members. Since psychologists belonging to specific ethnic\\ngroups or cultures have the most interest in studying the psychology of their communities, these organizations\\nprovide an opportunity for the growth of research on the interplay between culture and psychology.\\nWOMEN IN PSYCHOLOGY\\nAlthough rarely given credit, women have been contributing to psychology since its inception as a field of\\nstudy. In 1894, Margaret Floy Washburn was the first woman awarded the doctoral degree in psychology. She\\nwrote The Animal Mind: A Textbook of Comparative Psychology, and it was the standard in the field for over 20\\nyears. In the mid 1890s, Mary Whiton Calkins completed all requirements toward the PhD in psychology, but\\nHarvard University refused to award her that degree because she was a woman. She had been taught and\\nmentored by William James, who tried and failed to convince Harvard to award her the doctoral degree. Her\\nmemory research studied primacy and recency (Madigan & O’Hara, 1992), and she also wrote about how\\nstructuralism and functionalism both explained self-psychology (Calkins, 1906).\\nAnother influential woman, Mary Cover Jones, conducted a study she considered to be a sequel to John B.\\nWatson’s study of Little Albert (you’ll learn about this study in the chapter on Learning). Jones unconditioned\\nfear in Little Peter, who had been afraid of rabbits (Jones, 1924).\\nEthnic minority women contributing to the field of psychology include Martha Bernal and Inez Beverly Prosser;\\ntheir studies were related to education. Bernal, the first Latina to earn her doctoral degree in psychology\\n(1962) conducted much of her research with Mexican American children. Prosser was the first African\\nAmerican woman awarded the PhD in 1933 at the University of Cincinnati (Benjamin, Henry, & McMahon,\\n2005).\\n1.3 Contemporary Psychology\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Appreciate the diversity of interests and foci within psychology\\n• Understand basic interests and applications in each of the described areas of psychology\\n• Demonstrate familiarity with some of the major concepts or important figures in each of the described areas of\\npsychology\\nContemporary psychology is a diverse field that is influenced by all of the historical perspectives described in\\nthe preceding section. Reflective of the discipline’s diversity is the diversity seen within the American\\nPsychological Association (APA). The APA is a professional organization representing psychologists in the\\nUnited States. The APA is the largest organization of psychologists in the world, and its mission is to advance\\nand disseminate psychological knowledge for the betterment of people. There are 54 divisions within the APA,\\nrepresenting a wide variety of specialties that range from Societies for the Psychology of Religion and\\nSpirituality to Exercise and Sport Psychology to Behavioral Neuroscience and Comparative Psychology.\\nReflecting the diversity of the field of psychology itself, members, affiliate members, and associate members\\nspan the spectrum from students to doctoral-level psychologists, and come from a variety of places including\\neducational settings, criminal justice, hospitals, the armed forces, and industry (American Psychological\\nAssociation, 2014). G. Stanley Hall was the first president of the APA. Before he earned his doctoral degree, he\\nwas an adjunct instructor at Wilberforce University, a historically Black college/university (HBCU), while\\nserving as faculty at Antioch College. Hall went on to work under William James, earning his PhD. Eventually,\\n18 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nhe became the first president of Clark University in Massachusetts when it was founded (Pickren & Rutherford,\\n2010).\\nThe Association for Psychological Science (APS) was founded in 1988 and seeks to advance the scientific\\norientation of psychology. Its founding resulted from disagreements between members of the scientific and\\nclinical branches of psychology within the APA. The APS publishes five research journals and engages in\\neducation and advocacy with funding agencies. A significant proportion of its members are international,\\nalthough the majority is located in the United States. Other organizations provide networking and\\ncollaboration opportunities for professionals of several ethnic or racial groups working in psychology, such as\\nthe National Latina/o Psychological Association (NLPA), the Asian American Psychological Association (AAPA),\\nthe Association of Black Psychologists (ABPsi), and the Society of Indian Psychologists (SIP). Most of these\\ngroups are also dedicated to studying psychological and social issues within their specific communities.\\nThis section will provide an overview of the major subdivisions within psychology today in the order in which\\nthey are introduced throughout the remainder of this textbook.

While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember what he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is associated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend’s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John Nash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would tell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended for him. He also began to hear voices in his head that he could not control. When he tried to stop them, they would come back to him, and when he did not want them to, the voices would leave him (Wearing, n.d.). These are just a few of the many examples of how people experience the world around them in ways that are unpredictable and difficult to understand. In this chapter, we will explore what psychology is, what it is not, and how it has evolved over time. We will also look at some common misconceptions about psychology. Finally, we will discuss some careers in psychology and the role that psychology plays in our lives. 2. WHAT IS PSYCHOLOGY? The word “psychology” comes from two Greek words, “psyche” and “logos,” which mean “mind” or “thinking.” Psychologists are interested in how the mind works and how we think and feel. They study the mental processes that occur in the brain, such as perception, attention, memory, thinking, problem solving, emotion, motivation, learning, decision making, self-regulation, personality, social behavior, etc. Psychologists use a variety of methods to study these processes, including observation, experiments, surveys, interviews, questionnaires, brain imaging, neuropsychology, cognitive neuroscience, psychometrics, clinical psychology, developmental psychology, ethnopsychology and social psychology. Psychology has a long and rich history. It has been practiced for thousands of years in many different cultures and societies. For example, in ancient Greece, Plato and Aristotle studied psychology in order to understand the nature of human beings and their relationships with each other and with their environment. In the Middle Ages, Christian theologians and philosophers used psychology as a tool for understanding the nature of God and his relationship with his creatures. During the Renaissance, scientists and thinkers such as Galileo Galilei, Isaac Newton, René Descartes, John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Auguste Comte, Jean-Paul Sartre, Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, William James, Edward Thorndike, B.F. Skinner and others developed theories of psychology that continue to shape our understanding of this field today. Today, psychology is a broad and diverse field that encompasses a wide range of subfields and disciplines. Some of these disciplines include: • Clinical psychology: This field focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders, as well as', 'references': '{\"sections\": [\"Introduction to Psychology/Careers in Psychology\", \"Introduction to Psychology/Contemporary Psychology\"], \"pages\": [\"28\", \"29\", \"20\"]}'}\n",

While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember\\nwhat he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is\\nassociated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend’s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John\\nNash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would\\ntell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended\\nfor him. He also began to hear voices and became suspicious of the people around him. Soon thereafter, Nash\\nwas diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a state-run mental institution (O’Connor & Robertson,\\n1Introduction to Psychology\\n2002). Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these\\nexperiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain’s internal\\nprocesses and people’s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of\\npsychology has explored these questions.\\n1.1 What Is Psychology?\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Define psychology\\n• Understand the merits of an education in psychology\\nWhat is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology\\nexplores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists\\nuse the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question\\nabout how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the\\nphenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or\\ngroup of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over\\ntime. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes\\nobservations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then\\npublished or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.\\nScientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because\\nit is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We\\nmust ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However,\\nwe can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus,\\npsychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.\\nIn general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot\\narrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the\\nmind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific\\nmethod is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on\\nobservation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or\\nprevious authorities.\\nIt was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this\\ntime, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is,\\nat its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological\\norganism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore,\\npsychology is also a social science.\\nWHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?\\nOften, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to\\nlearn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course\\nbecause it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as\\nnursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare\\npsychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses\\nacross the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology\\nmajors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook’s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality\\nand political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About\\n6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S.\\nDepartment of Education, 2016).\\n8 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nAn education in psychology is valuable for a number of reasons. Psychology students hone critical thinking\\nskills and are trained in the use of the scientific method. Critical thinking is the active application of a set of\\nskills to information for the understanding and evaluation of that information. The evaluation of\\ninformation—assessing its reliability and usefulness— is an important skill in a world full of competing “facts,”\\nmany of which are designed to be misleading. For example, critical thinking involves maintaining an attitude\\nof skepticism, recognizing internal biases, making use of logical thinking, asking appropriate questions, and\\nmaking observations. Psychology students also can develop better communication skills during the course of\\ntheir undergraduate coursework (American Psychological Association, 2011). Together, these factors increase\\nstudents’ scientific literacy and prepare students to critically evaluate the various sources of information they\\nencounter.\\nIn addition to these broad-based skills, psychology students come to understand the complex factors that\\nshape one’s behavior. They appreciate the interaction of our biology, our environment, and our experiences in\\ndetermining who we are and how we will behave. They learn about basic principles that guide how we think\\nand behave, and they come to recognize the tremendous diversity that exists across individuals and across\\ncultural boundaries (American Psychological Association, 2011).\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nWatch a brief video about some questions to consider before deciding to major in psychology\\n(http://openstax.org/l/psycmajor) to learn more.\\n1.2 History of Psychology\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Understand the importance of Wundt and James in the development of psychology\\n• Appreciate Freud’s influence on psychology\\n• Understand the basic tenets of Gestalt psychology\\n• Appreciate the important role that behaviorism played in psychology’s history\\n• Understand basic tenets of humanism\\n• Understand how the cognitive revolution shifted psychology’s focus back to the mind\\nPsychology is a relatively young science with its experimental roots in the 19th century, compared, for\\nexample, to human physiology, which dates much earlier. As mentioned, anyone interested in exploring issues\\nrelated to the mind generally did so in a philosophical context prior to the 19th century. Two 19th century\\nscholars, Wilhelm Wundt and William James, are generally credited as being the founders of psychology as a\\nscience and academic discipline that was distinct from philosophy. This section will provide an overview of the\\nshifts in paradigms that have influenced psychology from Wundt and James through today.\\nWundt and Structuralism\\nWilhelm Wundt (1832–1920) was a German scientist who was the first person to be referred to as a\\npsychologist. His famous book entitled Principles of Physiological Psychology was published in 1873. Wundt\\nviewed psychology as a scientific study of conscious experience, and he believed that the goal of psychology\\nwas to identify components of consciousness and how those components combined to result in our conscious\\nexperience. Wundt used introspection (he called it “internal perception”), a process by which someone\\nexamines their own conscious experience as objectively as possible, making the human mind like any other\\naspect of nature that a scientist observed. He believed in the notion of voluntarism—that people have free will\\nand should know the intentions of a psychological experiment if they were participating (Danziger, 1980).\\nWundt considered his version experimental introspection; he used instruments such as those that measured\\nreaction time. He also wrote Volkerpsychologie in 1904 in which he suggested that psychology should include\\nthe study of culture, as it involves the study of people. Edward Titchener, one of his students, went on to\\n1.2 • History of Psychology 9\\ndevelop structuralism. Its focus was on the contents of mental processes rather than their function (Pickren &\\nRutherford, 2010). Wundt established his psychology laboratory at the University at Leipzig in 1879 (Figure\\n1.2). In this laboratory, Wundt and his students conducted experiments on, for example, reaction times. A\\nsubject, sometimes in a room isolated from the scientist, would receive a stimulus such as a light, image, or\\nsound. The subject’s reaction to the stimulus would be to push a button, and an apparatus would record the\\ntime to reaction. Wundt could measure reaction time to one-thousandth of a second (Nicolas & Ferrand, 1999).\\nFIGURE 1.2 (a) Wilhelm Wundt is credited as one of the founders of psychology. He created the first laboratory for\\npsychological research. (b) This photo shows him seated and surrounded by fellow researchers and equipment in\\nhis laboratory in Germany.\\nHowever, despite his efforts to train individuals in the process of introspection, this process remained highly\\nsubjective, and there was very little agreement between individuals.\\nFunctionalism\\nWilliam James, John Dewey, and Charles Sanders Peirce helped establish functional psychology (Figure 1.3).\\nThey accepted Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection and viewed this theory as an explanation of an\\norganism’s characteristics. Key to that theory is the idea that natural selection leads to organisms that are\\nadapted to their environment, including their behavior. Adaptation means that a trait of an organism has a\\nfunction for the survival and reproduction of the individual, because it has been naturally selected. As James\\nsaw it, psychology’s purpose was to study the function of behavior in the world, and as such, his perspective\\nwas known as functionalism. Functionalism focused on how mental activities helped an organism fit into its\\nenvironment. Functionalism has a second, more subtle meaning in that functionalists were more interested in\\nthe operation of the whole mind rather than of its individual parts, which were the focus of structuralism. Like\\nWundt, James believed that introspection could serve as one means by which someone might study mental\\nactivities, but James also relied on more objective measures, including the use of various recording devices,\\nand examinations of concrete products of mental activities and of anatomy and physiology (Gordon, 1995).\\n10 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nFIGURE 1.7 Maslow’s hierarchy of needs is shown.\\nCarl Rogers (1902–1987) was also an American psychologist who, like Maslow, emphasized the potential for\\ngood that exists within all people (Figure 1.8). Rogers used a therapeutic technique known as client-centered\\ntherapy in helping his clients deal with problematic issues that resulted in their seeking psychotherapy. Unlike\\na psychoanalytic approach in which the therapist plays an important role in interpreting what conscious\\nbehavior reveals about the unconscious mind, client-centered therapy involves the patient taking a lead role in\\nthe therapy session. Rogers believed that a therapist needed to display three features to maximize the\\neffectiveness of this particular approach: unconditional positive regard, genuineness, and empathy.\\nUnconditional positive regard refers to the fact that the therapist accepts their client for who they are, no\\nmatter what they might say. Provided these factors, Rogers believed that people were more than capable of\\ndealing with and working through their own issues (Thorne & Henley, 2005).\\nFIGURE 1.8 Carl Rogers, shown in this portrait, developed a client-centered therapy method that has been\\ninfluential in clinical settings. (credit: \"Didius\"/Wikimedia Commons)\\nHumanism has been influential to psychology as a whole. Both Maslow and Rogers are well-known names\\namong students of psychology (you will read more about both later in this text), and their ideas have influenced\\nmany scholars. Furthermore, Rogers’ client-centered approach to therapy is still commonly used in\\npsychotherapeutic settings today (O’hara, n.d.)\\n1.2 • History of Psychology 15\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nView a brief video of Carl Rogers describing his therapeutic approach (http://openstax.org/l/crogers1) to learn\\nmore.\\nThe Cognitive Revolution\\nBehaviorism’s emphasis on objectivity and focus on external behavior had pulled psychologists’ attention away\\nfrom the mind for a prolonged period of time. The early work of the humanistic psychologists redirected\\nattention to the individual human as a whole, and as a conscious and self-aware being. By the 1950s, new\\ndisciplinary perspectives in linguistics, neuroscience, and computer science were emerging, and these areas\\nrevived interest in the mind as a focus of scientific inquiry. This particular perspective has come to be known\\nas the cognitive revolution (Miller, 2003). By 1967, Ulric Neisser published the first textbook entitled Cognitive\\nPsychology, which served as a core text in cognitive psychology courses around the country (Thorne & Henley,\\n2005).\\nAlthough no one person is entirely responsible for starting the cognitive revolution, Noam Chomsky was very\\ninfluential in the early days of this movement (Figure 1.9). Chomsky (1928–), an American linguist, was\\ndissatisfied with the influence that behaviorism had had on psychology. He believed that psychology’s focus on\\nbehavior was short-sighted and that the field had to re-incorporate mental functioning into its purview if it\\nwere to offer any meaningful contributions to understanding behavior (Miller, 2003).\\nFIGURE 1.9 Noam Chomsky was very influential in beginning the cognitive revolution. In 2010, this mural honoring\\nhim was put up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (credit: Robert Moran)\\nEuropean psychology had never really been as influenced by behaviorism as had American psychology; and\\nthus, the cognitive revolution helped reestablish lines of communication between European psychologists and\\ntheir American counterparts. Furthermore, psychologists began to cooperate with scientists in other fields,\\nlike anthropology, linguistics, computer science, and neuroscience, among others. This interdisciplinary\\napproach often was referred to as the cognitive sciences, and the influence and prominence of this particular\\nperspective resonates in modern-day psychology (Miller, 2003).\\nFeminist Psychology\\nThe science of psychology has had an impact on human wellbeing, both positive and negative. The dominant\\ninfluence of Western, White, and male academics in the early history of psychology meant that psychology\\ndeveloped with the biases inherent in those individuals, which often had negative consequences for members of\\nsociety who were not White or male. Women, members of ethnic minorities in both the United States and other\\ncountries, and individuals with sexual orientations other than straight had difficulties entering the field of\\npsychology and therefore influencing its development. They also suffered from the attitudes of White male\\npsychologists who were not immune to the nonscientific attitudes prevalent in the society in which they\\nDIG DEEPER\\n16 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\ndeveloped and worked. Until the 1960s, the science of psychology was largely a “womanless” psychology\\n(Crawford & Marecek, 1989), meaning that few women were able to practice psychology, so they had little\\ninfluence on what was studied. In addition, the experimental subjects of psychology were mostly men, which\\nresulted from underlying assumptions that gender had no influence on psychology and that women were not of\\nsufficient interest to study.\\nAn article by Naomi Weisstein, first published in 1968 (Weisstein, 1993), stimulated a feminist revolution in\\npsychology by presenting a critique of psychology as a science. She also specifically criticized male psychologists\\nfor constructing the psychology of women entirely out of their own cultural biases and without careful\\nexperimental tests to verify any of their characterizations of women. Weisstein used, as examples, statements by\\nprominent psychologists in the 1960s, such as this quote by Bruno Bettleheim: “We must start with the\\nrealization that, as much as women want to be good scientists or engineers, they want first and foremost to be\\nwomanly companions of men and to be mothers.” Weisstein’s critique formed the foundation for the subsequent\\ndevelopment of a feminist psychology that attempted to be free of the influence of male cultural biases on our\\nknowledge of the psychology of women.\\nCrawford & Marecek (1989) identify several feminist approaches to psychology that can be described as feminist\\npsychology. These include re-evaluating and discovering the contributions of women to the history of psychology,\\nstudying psychological gender differences, and questioning the male bias present across the practice of the\\nscientific approach to knowledge.\\nMulticultural And Cross-Cultural Psychology\\nCulture impacts individuals, groups, and society. An ongoing issue researchers are trying to correct is that\\ncertain populations have been over-studied and the results of these studies have been applied to other\\npopulations. For example, Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan discuss how WEIRD societies have been\\noverstudied and the results have been wrongly applied to non-WEIRD societies (2010). WEIRD stands for\\nwestern, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic. Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan found that there are\\nmany differences between people in the WEIRD group and people in less industrialized, less urban, and non-\\nWestern societies. These differences occur in a variety of areas, including perception, cooperation, and moral\\nreasoning. That is, people vary depending on their culture and environment. Multicultural psychologists\\ndevelop theories and conduct research with diverse populations, typically within one country. Cross-cultural\\npsychologists compare populations across countries, such as participants from the United States compared to\\nparticipants from China.\\nIn 1920, Francis Cecil Sumner was the first African American to receive a PhD in psychology in the United\\nStates. Sumner established a psychology degree program at Howard University, leading to the education of a\\nnew generation of African American psychologists (Black, Spence, and Omari, 2004). Much of the work of early\\npsychologists from diverse backgrounds was dedicated to challenging intelligence testing and promoting\\ninnovative educational methods for children. George I. Sanchez contested such testing with Mexican American\\nchildren. As a psychologist of Mexican heritage, he pointed out that the language and cultural barriers in\\ntesting were keeping children from equal opportunities (Guthrie, 1998). By 1940, he was teaching with his\\ndoctoral degree at University of Texas at Austin and challenging segregated educational practices (Romo,\\n1986).\\nTwo famous African American researchers and psychologists are Mamie Phipps Clark and her husband,\\nKenneth Clark. They are best known for their studies conducted on African American children and doll\\npreference, research that was instrumental in the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court desegregation\\ncase. The Clarks applied their research to social services and opened the first child guidance center in Harlem\\n(American Psychological Association, 2019).\\nListen to the podcast below describing the Clarks\\' research and impact on the Supreme Court decision.\\n1.2 • History of Psychology 17\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nListen to a podcast about the influence of an African American\\'s psychology research on the historic Brown v.\\nBoard of Education civil rights case (http://openstax.org/l/crogers2) to learn more.\\nThe American Psychological Association has several ethnically based organizations for professional\\npsychologists that facilitate interactions among members. Since psychologists belonging to specific ethnic\\ngroups or cultures have the most interest in studying the psychology of their communities, these organizations\\nprovide an opportunity for the growth of research on the interplay between culture and psychology.\\nWOMEN IN PSYCHOLOGY\\nAlthough rarely given credit, women have been contributing to psychology since its inception as a field of\\nstudy. In 1894, Margaret Floy Washburn was the first woman awarded the doctoral degree in psychology. She\\nwrote The Animal Mind: A Textbook of Comparative Psychology, and it was the standard in the field for over 20\\nyears. In the mid 1890s, Mary Whiton Calkins completed all requirements toward the PhD in psychology, but\\nHarvard University refused to award her that degree because she was a woman. She had been taught and\\nmentored by William James, who tried and failed to convince Harvard to award her the doctoral degree. Her\\nmemory research studied primacy and recency (Madigan & O’Hara, 1992), and she also wrote about how\\nstructuralism and functionalism both explained self-psychology (Calkins, 1906).\\nAnother influential woman, Mary Cover Jones, conducted a study she considered to be a sequel to John B.\\nWatson’s study of Little Albert (you’ll learn about this study in the chapter on Learning). Jones unconditioned\\nfear in Little Peter, who had been afraid of rabbits (Jones, 1924).\\nEthnic minority women contributing to the field of psychology include Martha Bernal and Inez Beverly Prosser;\\ntheir studies were related to education. Bernal, the first Latina to earn her doctoral degree in psychology\\n(1962) conducted much of her research with Mexican American children. Prosser was the first African\\nAmerican woman awarded the PhD in 1933 at the University of Cincinnati (Benjamin, Henry, & McMahon,\\n2005).\\n1.3 Contemporary Psychology\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Appreciate the diversity of interests and foci within psychology\\n• Understand basic interests and applications in each of the described areas of psychology\\n• Demonstrate familiarity with some of the major concepts or important figures in each of the described areas of\\npsychology\\nContemporary psychology is a diverse field that is influenced by all of the historical perspectives described in\\nthe preceding section. Reflective of the discipline’s diversity is the diversity seen within the American\\nPsychological Association (APA). The APA is a professional organization representing psychologists in the\\nUnited States. The APA is the largest organization of psychologists in the world, and its mission is to advance\\nand disseminate psychological knowledge for the betterment of people. There are 54 divisions within the APA,\\nrepresenting a wide variety of specialties that range from Societies for the Psychology of Religion and\\nSpirituality to Exercise and Sport Psychology to Behavioral Neuroscience and Comparative Psychology.\\nReflecting the diversity of the field of psychology itself, members, affiliate members, and associate members\\nspan the spectrum from students to doctoral-level psychologists, and come from a variety of places including\\neducational settings, criminal justice, hospitals, the armed forces, and industry (American Psychological\\nAssociation, 2014). G. Stanley Hall was the first president of the APA. Before he earned his doctoral degree, he\\nwas an adjunct instructor at Wilberforce University, a historically Black college/university (HBCU), while\\nserving as faculty at Antioch College. Hall went on to work under William James, earning his PhD. Eventually,\\n18 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nhe became the first president of Clark University in Massachusetts when it was founded (Pickren & Rutherford,\\n2010).\\nThe Association for Psychological Science (APS) was founded in 1988 and seeks to advance the scientific\\norientation of psychology. Its founding resulted from disagreements between members of the scientific and\\nclinical branches of psychology within the APA. The APS publishes five research journals and engages in\\neducation and advocacy with funding agencies. A significant proportion of its members are international,\\nalthough the majority is located in the United States. Other organizations provide networking and\\ncollaboration opportunities for professionals of several ethnic or racial groups working in psychology, such as\\nthe National Latina/o Psychological Association (NLPA), the Asian American Psychological Association (AAPA),\\nthe Association of Black Psychologists (ABPsi), and the Society of Indian Psychologists (SIP). Most of these\\ngroups are also dedicated to studying psychological and social issues within their specific communities.\\nThis section will provide an overview of the major subdivisions within psychology today in the order in which\\nthey are introduced throughout the remainder of this textbook. This is not meant to be an exhaustive listing,\\nbut it will provide insight into the major areas of research and practice of modern-day psychologists.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nPlease visit this website about the divisions within the APA (http://openstax.org/l/biopsychology) to learn more.\\nView these student resources (http://openstax.org/l/studentresource) also provided by the APA.\\nBiopsychology and Evolutionary Psychology\\nAs the name suggests, biopsychology explores how our biology influences our behavior. While biological\\npsychology is a broad field, many biological psychologists want to understand how the structure and function\\nof the nervous system is related to behavior (Figure 1.10). As such, they often combine the research strategies\\nof both psychologists and physiologists to accomplish this goal (as discussed in Carlson, 2013).\\nFIGURE 1.10 Biological psychologists study how the structure and function of the nervous system generate\\nbehavior.\\nThe research interests of biological psychologists span a number of domains, including but not limited to,\\n1.3 • Contemporary Psychology 19\\nIn addition to clinical scales, the tests also have validity and reliability scales. (Recall the concepts of reliability\\nand validity from your study of psychological research.) One of the validity scales, the Lie Scale (or “L” Scale),\\nconsists of 15 items and is used to ascertain whether the respondent is “faking good” (underreporting\\npsychological problems to appear healthier). For example, if someone responds “yes” to a number of\\nunrealistically positive items such as “I have never told a lie,” they may be trying to “fake good” or appear\\nbetter than they actually are.\\nReliability scales test an instrument’s consistency over time, assuring that if you take the MMPI-2-RF today and\\nthen again 5 years later, your two scores will be similar. Beutler, Nussbaum, and Meredith (1988) gave the\\nMMPI to newly recruited police officers and then to the same police officers 2 years later. After 2 years on the\\njob, police officers’ responses indicated an increased vulnerability to alcoholism, somatic symptoms (vague,\\nunexplained physical complaints), and anxiety. When the test was given an additional 2 years later (4 years\\nafter starting on the job), the results suggested high risk for alcohol-related difficulties.\\nProjective Tests\\nAnother method for assessment of personality is projective testing. This kind of test relies on one of the\\ndefense mechanisms proposed by Freud—projection—as a way to assess unconscious processes. During this\\ntype of testing, a series of ambiguous cards is shown to the person being tested, who then is encouraged to\\nproject their feelings, impulses, and desires onto the cards—by telling a story, interpreting an image, or\\ncompleting a sentence. Many projective tests have undergone standardization procedures (for example, Exner,\\n2002) and can be used to access whether someone has unusual thoughts or a high level of anxiety, or is likely\\nto become volatile. Some examples of projective tests are the Rorschach Inkblot Test, the Thematic\\nApperception Test (TAT), the Contemporized-Themes Concerning Blacks test, the TEMAS (Tell-Me-A-Story),\\nand the Rotter Incomplete Sentence Blank (RISB). Projective tests are less subject to intentional distortion; it is\\nhard to fake “good\" because it is not obvious what a \"good” answer is. Projective tests are more time\\nconsuming for the evaluator than self-report inventories. If an evaluator scores the Rorschach using the Exner\\nscoring system, the test is considered a valid and reliable measure. However, the validity of the other projective\\ntests is questionable, and the results are often not usable for court cases (Goldstein, n.d.).\\nThe Rorschach Inkblot Test was developed in 1921 by a Swiss psychologist named Hermann Rorschach\\n(pronounced “ROAR-shock”). It is a series of symmetrical inkblot cards that are presented to a client by a\\npsychologist. Upon presentation of each card, the psychologist asks the client, “What might this be?” What the\\ntest-taker sees reveals unconscious feelings and struggles (Piotrowski, 1987; Weiner, 2003). The Rorschach\\nhas been standardized using the Exner system and is effective in measuring depression, psychosis, and\\nanxiety.\\nA second projective test is the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT), created in the 1930s by Henry Murray, an\\nAmerican psychologist, and a psychoanalyst named Christiana Morgan. A person taking the TAT is shown\\n8–12 ambiguous pictures and is asked to tell a story about each picture (Figure 11.18). The stories give insight\\ninto their social world, revealing hopes, fears, interests, and goals. The storytelling format helps to lower a\\nperson’s resistance divulging unconscious personal details (Cramer, 2004). The TAT has been used in clinical\\nsettings to evaluate psychological disorders; more recently, it has been used in counseling settings to help\\nclients gain a better understanding of themselves and achieve personal growth. Standardization of test\\nadministration is virtually nonexistent among clinicians, and the test tends to be modest to low on validity and\\nreliability (Aronow, Weiss, & Rezinkoff, 2001; Lilienfeld, Wood, & Garb, 2000). Despite these shortcomings, the\\nTAT has been one of the most widely used projective tests.\\n388 11 • Personality\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nFIGURE 11.18 This image from the Thematic Apperception Tests (TAT) can be used in counseling settings.\\nA third projective test is the Rotter Incomplete Sentence Blank (RISB) developed by Julian Rotter in 1950\\n(recall his theory of locus of control, covered earlier in this chapter). There are three forms of this test for use\\nwith different age groups: the school form, the college form, and the adult form. The tests include 40\\nincomplete sentences that people are asked to complete as quickly as possible (Figure 11.19). The average\\ntime for completing the test is approximately 20 minutes, as responses are only 1–2 words in length. This test\\nis similar to a word association test, and like other types of projective tests, it is presumed that responses will\\nreveal desires, fears, and struggles. The RISB is used in screening college students for adjustment problems\\nand in career counseling (Holaday, Smith, & Sherry, 2010; Rotter & Rafferty 1950).\\nFIGURE 11.19 These incomplete sentences resemble the types of questions on the RISB.

It is\\ndifficult to assess the personalities and lifestyles of members of widely divergent ethnic/cultural groups using\\npersonality instruments based on data from a single culture or race (Hoy-Watkins & Jenkins-Moore, 2008). For\\nexample, when the TAT was used with African-American test takers, the result was often shorter story length\\nand low levels of cultural identification (Duzant, 2005). Therefore, it was vital to develop other personality\\nassessments that explored factors such as race, language, and level of acculturation (Hoy-Watkins & Jenkins-\\nMoore, 2008). To address this need, Robert Williams developed the first culturally specific projective test\\ndesigned to reflect the everyday life experiences of African Americans (Hoy-Watkins & Jenkins-Moore, 2008).\\nThe updated version of the instrument is the Contemporized-Themes Concerning Blacks Test (C-TCB)\\n(Williams, 1972). The C-TCB contains 20 color images that show scenes of African-American lifestyles. When\\nthe C-TCB was compared with the TAT for African Americans, it was found that use of the C-TCB led to\\nincreased story length, higher degrees of positive feelings, and stronger identification with the C-TCB (Hoy,\\n1997; Hoy-Watkins & Jenkins-Moore, 2008).\\n11.9 • Personality Assessment 389\\nThe TEMAS Multicultural Thematic Apperception Test is another tool designed to be culturally relevant to\\nminority groups, especially Hispanic youths.

The word “psychology” comes from two Greek words, “psyche” and “logos,” which mean “mind” or “thinking.” Psychologists are interested in how the mind works and how we think and feel. They study the mental processes that occur in the brain, such as perception, attention, memory, thinking, problem solving, emotion, motivation, learning, decision making, self-regulation, personality, social behavior, etc. Psychologists use a variety of methods to study these processes, including observation, experiments, surveys, interviews, questionnaires, brain imaging, neuropsychology, cognitive neuroscience, psychometrics, clinical psychology, developmental psychology, ethnopsychology and social psychology. Psychology has a long and rich history. It has been practiced for thousands of years in many different cultures and societies. For example, in ancient Greece, Plato and Aristotle studied psychology in order to understand the nature of human beings and their relationships with each other and with their environment. In the Middle Ages, Christian theologians and philosophers used psychology as a tool for understanding the nature of God and his relationship with his creatures. During the Renaissance, scientists and thinkers such as Galileo Galilei, Isaac Newton, René Descartes, John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Auguste Comte, Jean-Paul Sartre, Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, William James, Edward Thorndike, B.F. Skinner and others developed theories of psychology that continue to shape our understanding of this field today. Today, psychology is a broad and diverse field that encompasses a wide range of subfields and disciplines. Some of these disciplines include: • Clinical psychology: This field focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders, as well as', 'references': '{\"sections\": [\"Introduction to Psychology/Careers in Psychology\", \"Social Psychology/What Is Social Psychology?\", \"Introduction to Psychology/Contemporary Psychology\"], \"pages\": [\"29\", \"402\", \"20\"]}'}\n",

However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would\\ntell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended\\nfor him. He also began to hear voices and became suspicious of the people around him. Soon thereafter, Nash\\nwas diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a state-run mental institution (O’Connor & Robertson,\\n1Introduction to Psychology\\n2002). Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these\\nexperiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain’s internal\\nprocesses and people’s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of\\npsychology has explored these questions.\\n1.1 What Is Psychology?\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Define psychology\\n• Understand the merits of an education in psychology\\nWhat is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology\\nexplores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists\\nuse the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question\\nabout how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the\\nphenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or\\ngroup of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over\\ntime. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes\\nobservations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then\\npublished or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.\\nScientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because\\nit is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We\\nmust ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However,\\nwe can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus,\\npsychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.\\nIn general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot\\narrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the\\nmind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific\\nmethod is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on\\nobservation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or\\nprevious authorities.\\nIt was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this\\ntime, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is,\\nat its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological\\norganism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore,\\npsychology is also a social science.\\nWHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?\\nOften, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to\\nlearn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course\\nbecause it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as\\nnursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare\\npsychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses\\nacross the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology\\nmajors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook’s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality\\nand political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About\\n6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S.\\nDepartment of Education, 2016).\\n8 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nAn education in psychology is valuable for a number of reasons. Psychology students hone critical thinking\\nskills and are trained in the use of the scientific method. Critical thinking is the active application of a set of\\nskills to information for the understanding and evaluation of that information. The evaluation of\\ninformation—assessing its reliability and usefulness— is an important skill in a world full of competing “facts,”\\nmany of which are designed to be misleading. For example, critical thinking involves maintaining an attitude\\nof skepticism, recognizing internal biases, making use of logical thinking, asking appropriate questions, and\\nmaking observations. Psychology students also can develop better communication skills during the course of\\ntheir undergraduate coursework (American Psychological Association, 2011). Together, these factors increase\\nstudents’ scientific literacy and prepare students to critically evaluate the various sources of information they\\nencounter.\\nIn addition to these broad-based skills, psychology students come to understand the complex factors that\\nshape one’s behavior. They appreciate the interaction of our biology, our environment, and our experiences in\\ndetermining who we are and how we will behave. They learn about basic principles that guide how we think\\nand behave, and they come to recognize the tremendous diversity that exists across individuals and across\\ncultural boundaries (American Psychological Association, 2011).\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nWatch a brief video about some questions to consider before deciding to major in psychology\\n(http://openstax.org/l/psycmajor) to learn more.\\n1.2 History of Psychology\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Understand the importance of Wundt and James in the development of psychology\\n• Appreciate Freud’s influence on psychology\\n• Understand the basic tenets of Gestalt psychology\\n• Appreciate the important role that behaviorism played in psychology’s history\\n• Understand basic tenets of humanism\\n• Understand how the cognitive revolution shifted psychology’s focus back to the mind\\nPsychology is a relatively young science with its experimental roots in the 19th century, compared, for\\nexample, to human physiology, which dates much earlier. As mentioned, anyone interested in exploring issues\\nrelated to the mind generally did so in a philosophical context prior to the 19th century. Two 19th century\\nscholars, Wilhelm Wundt and William James, are generally credited as being the founders of psychology as a\\nscience and academic discipline that was distinct from philosophy. This section will provide an overview of the\\nshifts in paradigms that have influenced psychology from Wundt and James through today.\\nWundt and Structuralism\\nWilhelm Wundt (1832–1920) was a German scientist who was the first person to be referred to as a\\npsychologist. His famous book entitled Principles of Physiological Psychology was published in 1873. Wundt\\nviewed psychology as a scientific study of conscious experience, and he believed that the goal of psychology\\nwas to identify components of consciousness and how those components combined to result in our conscious\\nexperience. Wundt used introspection (he called it “internal perception”), a process by which someone\\nexamines their own conscious experience as objectively as possible, making the human mind like any other\\naspect of nature that a scientist observed. He believed in the notion of voluntarism—that people have free will\\nand should know the intentions of a psychological experiment if they were participating (Danziger, 1980).\\nWundt considered his version experimental introspection; he used instruments such as those that measured\\nreaction time. He also wrote Volkerpsychologie in 1904 in which he suggested that psychology should include\\nthe study of culture, as it involves the study of people. Edward Titchener, one of his students, went on to\\n1.2 • History of Psychology 9\\ndevelop structuralism. Its focus was on the contents of mental processes rather than their function (Pickren &\\nRutherford, 2010). Wundt established his psychology laboratory at the University at Leipzig in 1879 (Figure\\n1.2). In this laboratory, Wundt and his students conducted experiments on, for example, reaction times. A\\nsubject, sometimes in a room isolated from the scientist, would receive a stimulus such as a light, image, or\\nsound. The subject’s reaction to the stimulus would be to push a button, and an apparatus would record the\\ntime to reaction. Wundt could measure reaction time to one-thousandth of a second (Nicolas & Ferrand, 1999).\\nFIGURE 1.2 (a) Wilhelm Wundt is credited as one of the founders of psychology. He created the first laboratory for\\npsychological research. (b) This photo shows him seated and surrounded by fellow researchers and equipment in\\nhis laboratory in Germany.\\nHowever, despite his efforts to train individuals in the process of introspection, this process remained highly\\nsubjective, and there was very little agreement between individuals.\\nFunctionalism\\nWilliam James, John Dewey, and Charles Sanders Peirce helped establish functional psychology (Figure 1.3).\\nThey accepted Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection and viewed this theory as an explanation of an\\norganism’s characteristics. Key to that theory is the idea that natural selection leads to organisms that are\\nadapted to their environment, including their behavior. Adaptation means that a trait of an organism has a\\nfunction for the survival and reproduction of the individual, because it has been naturally selected. As James\\nsaw it, psychology’s purpose was to study the function of behavior in the world, and as such, his perspective\\nwas known as functionalism. Functionalism focused on how mental activities helped an organism fit into its\\nenvironment. Functionalism has a second, more subtle meaning in that functionalists were more interested in\\nthe operation of the whole mind rather than of its individual parts, which were the focus of structuralism. Like\\nWundt, James believed that introspection could serve as one means by which someone might study mental\\nactivities, but James also relied on more objective measures, including the use of various recording devices,\\nand examinations of concrete products of mental activities and of anatomy and physiology (Gordon, 1995).\\n10 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nFIGURE 1.7 Maslow’s hierarchy of needs is shown.\\nCarl Rogers (1902–1987) was also an American psychologist who, like Maslow, emphasized the potential for\\ngood that exists within all people (Figure 1.8). Rogers used a therapeutic technique known as client-centered\\ntherapy in helping his clients deal with problematic issues that resulted in their seeking psychotherapy. Unlike\\na psychoanalytic approach in which the therapist plays an important role in interpreting what conscious\\nbehavior reveals about the unconscious mind, client-centered therapy involves the patient taking a lead role in\\nthe therapy session. Rogers believed that a therapist needed to display three features to maximize the\\neffectiveness of this particular approach: unconditional positive regard, genuineness, and empathy.\\nUnconditional positive regard refers to the fact that the therapist accepts their client for who they are, no\\nmatter what they might say. Provided these factors, Rogers believed that people were more than capable of\\ndealing with and working through their own issues (Thorne & Henley, 2005).\\nFIGURE 1.8 Carl Rogers, shown in this portrait, developed a client-centered therapy method that has been\\ninfluential in clinical settings. (credit: \"Didius\"/Wikimedia Commons)\\nHumanism has been influential to psychology as a whole. Both Maslow and Rogers are well-known names\\namong students of psychology (you will read more about both later in this text), and their ideas have influenced\\nmany scholars. Furthermore, Rogers’ client-centered approach to therapy is still commonly used in\\npsychotherapeutic settings today (O’hara, n.d.)\\n1.2 • History of Psychology 15\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nView a brief video of Carl Rogers describing his therapeutic approach (http://openstax.org/l/crogers1) to learn\\nmore.\\nThe Cognitive Revolution\\nBehaviorism’s emphasis on objectivity and focus on external behavior had pulled psychologists’ attention away\\nfrom the mind for a prolonged period of time. The early work of the humanistic psychologists redirected\\nattention to the individual human as a whole, and as a conscious and self-aware being. By the 1950s, new\\ndisciplinary perspectives in linguistics, neuroscience, and computer science were emerging, and these areas\\nrevived interest in the mind as a focus of scientific inquiry. This particular perspective has come to be known\\nas the cognitive revolution (Miller, 2003). By 1967, Ulric Neisser published the first textbook entitled Cognitive\\nPsychology, which served as a core text in cognitive psychology courses around the country (Thorne & Henley,\\n2005).\\nAlthough no one person is entirely responsible for starting the cognitive revolution, Noam Chomsky was very\\ninfluential in the early days of this movement (Figure 1.9). Chomsky (1928–), an American linguist, was\\ndissatisfied with the influence that behaviorism had had on psychology. He believed that psychology’s focus on\\nbehavior was short-sighted and that the field had to re-incorporate mental functioning into its purview if it\\nwere to offer any meaningful contributions to understanding behavior (Miller, 2003).\\nFIGURE 1.9 Noam Chomsky was very influential in beginning the cognitive revolution. In 2010, this mural honoring\\nhim was put up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (credit: Robert Moran)\\nEuropean psychology had never really been as influenced by behaviorism as had American psychology; and\\nthus, the cognitive revolution helped reestablish lines of communication between European psychologists and\\ntheir American counterparts. Furthermore, psychologists began to cooperate with scientists in other fields,\\nlike anthropology, linguistics, computer science, and neuroscience, among others. This interdisciplinary\\napproach often was referred to as the cognitive sciences, and the influence and prominence of this particular\\nperspective resonates in modern-day psychology (Miller, 2003).\\nFeminist Psychology\\nThe science of psychology has had an impact on human wellbeing, both positive and negative. The dominant\\ninfluence of Western, White, and male academics in the early history of psychology meant that psychology\\ndeveloped with the biases inherent in those individuals, which often had negative consequences for members of\\nsociety who were not White or male. Women, members of ethnic minorities in both the United States and other\\ncountries, and individuals with sexual orientations other than straight had difficulties entering the field of\\npsychology and therefore influencing its development. They also suffered from the attitudes of White male\\npsychologists who were not immune to the nonscientific attitudes prevalent in the society in which they\\nDIG DEEPER\\n16 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\ndeveloped and worked. Until the 1960s, the science of psychology was largely a “womanless” psychology\\n(Crawford & Marecek, 1989), meaning that few women were able to practice psychology, so they had little\\ninfluence on what was studied. In addition, the experimental subjects of psychology were mostly men, which\\nresulted from underlying assumptions that gender had no influence on psychology and that women were not of\\nsufficient interest to study.\\nAn article by Naomi Weisstein, first published in 1968 (Weisstein, 1993), stimulated a feminist revolution in\\npsychology by presenting a critique of psychology as a science. She also specifically criticized male psychologists\\nfor constructing the psychology of women entirely out of their own cultural biases and without careful\\nexperimental tests to verify any of their characterizations of women. Weisstein used, as examples, statements by\\nprominent psychologists in the 1960s, such as this quote by Bruno Bettleheim: “We must start with the\\nrealization that, as much as women want to be good scientists or engineers, they want first and foremost to be\\nwomanly companions of men and to be mothers.” Weisstein’s critique formed the foundation for the subsequent\\ndevelopment of a feminist psychology that attempted to be free of the influence of male cultural biases on our\\nknowledge of the psychology of women.\\nCrawford & Marecek (1989) identify several feminist approaches to psychology that can be described as feminist\\npsychology. These include re-evaluating and discovering the contributions of women to the history of psychology,\\nstudying psychological gender differences, and questioning the male bias present across the practice of the\\nscientific approach to knowledge.\\nMulticultural And Cross-Cultural Psychology\\nCulture impacts individuals, groups, and society. An ongoing issue researchers are trying to correct is that\\ncertain populations have been over-studied and the results of these studies have been applied to other\\npopulations. For example, Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan discuss how WEIRD societies have been\\noverstudied and the results have been wrongly applied to non-WEIRD societies (2010). WEIRD stands for\\nwestern, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic. Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan found that there are\\nmany differences between people in the WEIRD group and people in less industrialized, less urban, and non-\\nWestern societies. These differences occur in a variety of areas, including perception, cooperation, and moral\\nreasoning. That is, people vary depending on their culture and environment. Multicultural psychologists\\ndevelop theories and conduct research with diverse populations, typically within one country. Cross-cultural\\npsychologists compare populations across countries, such as participants from the United States compared to\\nparticipants from China.\\nIn 1920, Francis Cecil Sumner was the first African American to receive a PhD in psychology in the United\\nStates. Sumner established a psychology degree program at Howard University, leading to the education of a\\nnew generation of African American psychologists (Black, Spence, and Omari, 2004). Much of the work of early\\npsychologists from diverse backgrounds was dedicated to challenging intelligence testing and promoting\\ninnovative educational methods for children. George I. Sanchez contested such testing with Mexican American\\nchildren. As a psychologist of Mexican heritage, he pointed out that the language and cultural barriers in\\ntesting were keeping children from equal opportunities (Guthrie, 1998). By 1940, he was teaching with his\\ndoctoral degree at University of Texas at Austin and challenging segregated educational practices (Romo,\\n1986).\\nTwo famous African American researchers and psychologists are Mamie Phipps Clark and her husband,\\nKenneth Clark. They are best known for their studies conducted on African American children and doll\\npreference, research that was instrumental in the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court desegregation\\ncase.

Since psychologists belonging to specific ethnic\\ngroups or cultures have the most interest in studying the psychology of their communities, these organizations\\nprovide an opportunity for the growth of research on the interplay between culture and psychology.\\nWOMEN IN PSYCHOLOGY\\nAlthough rarely given credit, women have been contributing to psychology since its inception as a field of\\nstudy. In 1894, Margaret Floy Washburn was the first woman awarded the doctoral degree in psychology. She\\nwrote The Animal Mind: A Textbook of Comparative Psychology, and it was the standard in the field for over 20\\nyears. In the mid 1890s, Mary Whiton Calkins completed all requirements toward the PhD in psychology, but\\nHarvard University refused to award her that degree because she was a woman. She had been taught and\\nmentored by William James, who tried and failed to convince Harvard to award her the doctoral degree. Her\\nmemory research studied primacy and recency (Madigan & O’Hara, 1992), and she also wrote about how\\nstructuralism and functionalism both explained self-psychology (Calkins, 1906).\\nAnother influential woman, Mary Cover Jones, conducted a study she considered to be a sequel to John B.\\nWatson’s study of Little Albert (you’ll learn about this study in the chapter on Learning). Jones unconditioned\\nfear in Little Peter, who had been afraid of rabbits (Jones, 1924).\\nEthnic minority women contributing to the field of psychology include Martha Bernal and Inez Beverly Prosser;\\ntheir studies were related to education. Bernal, the first Latina to earn her doctoral degree in psychology\\n(1962) conducted much of her research with Mexican American children. Prosser was the first African\\nAmerican woman awarded the PhD in 1933 at the University of Cincinnati (Benjamin, Henry, & McMahon,\\n2005).\\n1.3 Contemporary Psychology\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Appreciate the diversity of interests and foci within psychology\\n• Understand basic interests and applications in each of the described areas of psychology\\n• Demonstrate familiarity with some of the major concepts or important figures in each of the described areas of\\npsychology\\nContemporary psychology is a diverse field that is influenced by all of the historical perspectives described in\\nthe preceding section. Reflective of the discipline’s diversity is the diversity seen within the American\\nPsychological Association (APA). The APA is a professional organization representing psychologists in the\\nUnited States. The APA is the largest organization of psychologists in the world, and its mission is to advance\\nand disseminate psychological knowledge for the betterment of people. There are 54 divisions within the APA,\\nrepresenting a wide variety of specialties that range from Societies for the Psychology of Religion and\\nSpirituality to Exercise and Sport Psychology to Behavioral Neuroscience and Comparative Psychology.\\nReflecting the diversity of the field of psychology itself, members, affiliate members, and associate members\\nspan the spectrum from students to doctoral-level psychologists, and come from a variety of places including\\neducational settings, criminal justice, hospitals, the armed forces, and industry (American Psychological\\nAssociation, 2014). G. Stanley Hall was the first president of the APA. Before he earned his doctoral degree, he\\nwas an adjunct instructor at Wilberforce University, a historically Black college/university (HBCU), while\\nserving as faculty at Antioch College. Hall went on to work under William James, earning his PhD. Eventually,\\n18 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nhe became the first president of Clark University in Massachusetts when it was founded (Pickren & Rutherford,\\n2010).\\nThe Association for Psychological Science (APS) was founded in 1988 and seeks to advance the scientific\\norientation of psychology. Its founding resulted from disagreements between members of the scientific and\\nclinical branches of psychology within the APA. The APS publishes five research journals and engages in\\neducation and advocacy with funding agencies. A significant proportion of its members are international,\\nalthough the majority is located in the United States. Other organizations provide networking and\\ncollaboration opportunities for professionals of several ethnic or racial groups working in psychology, such as\\nthe National Latina/o Psychological Association (NLPA), the Asian American Psychological Association (AAPA),\\nthe Association of Black Psychologists (ABPsi), and the Society of Indian Psychologists (SIP). Most of these\\ngroups are also dedicated to studying psychological and social issues within their specific communities.\\nThis section will provide an overview of the major subdivisions within psychology today in the order in which\\nthey are introduced throughout the remainder of this textbook.

While biological\\npsychology is a broad field, many biological psychologists want to understand how the structure and function\\nof the nervous system is related to behavior (Figure 1.10). As such, they often combine the research strategies\\nof both psychologists and physiologists to accomplish this goal (as discussed in Carlson, 2013).\\nFIGURE 1.10 Biological psychologists study how the structure and function of the nervous system generate\\nbehavior.\\nThe research interests of biological psychologists span a number of domains, including but not limited to,\\n1.3 • Contemporary Psychology 19\\nThey often are called Likert scales after their developer, Rensis Likert (1932) (Figure 11.16). Self-report\\ninventories are generally easy to administer and cost effective. There is also an increased likelihood of test\\ntakers being inclined to answer in ways that are intentionally or unintentionally more socially desirable,\\nexaggerated, biased, or misleading. For example, someone applying for a job will likely try to present\\nthemselves in a positive light, perhaps as an even better candidate than they actually are.\\nFIGURE 11.16 If you’ve ever taken a survey, you are probably familiar with Likert-type scale questions. Most\\npersonality inventories employ these types of response scales.\\nOne of the most widely used personality inventories is the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory\\n(MMPI), first published in 1943, with 504 true/false questions, and updated to the MMPI-2 in 1989, with 567\\nquestions. The original MMPI was based on a small, limited sample, composed mostly of Minnesota farmers\\nand psychiatric patients; the revised inventory was based on a more representative, national sample to allow\\nfor better standardization. The MMPI-2 takes 1–2 hours to complete. Responses are scored to produce a\\nclinical profile composed of 10 scales: hypochondriasis, depression, hysteria, psychopathic deviance (social\\ndeviance), masculinity versus femininity, paranoia, psychasthenia (obsessive/compulsive qualities),\\nschizophrenia, hypomania, and social introversion. There is also a scale to ascertain risk factors for alcohol\\nabuse. In 2008, the test was again revised, using more advanced methods, to the MMPI-2-RF. This version\\ntakes about one-half the time to complete and has only 338 questions (Figure 11.17). Despite the new test’s\\nadvantages, the MMPI-2 is more established and is still more widely used. Typically, the tests are administered\\nby computer. Although the MMPI was originally developed to assist in the clinical diagnosis of psychological\\ndisorders, it is now also used for occupational screening, such as in law enforcement, and in college, career,\\nand marital counseling (Ben-Porath & Tellegen, 2008).\\nFIGURE 11.17 These true/false questions resemble the kinds of questions you would find on the MMPI.\\n11.9 • Personality Assessment 387\\nIn addition to clinical scales, the tests also have validity and reliability scales. (Recall the concepts of reliability\\nand validity from your study of psychological research.) One of the validity scales, the Lie Scale (or “L” Scale),\\nconsists of 15 items and is used to ascertain whether the respondent is “faking good” (underreporting\\npsychological problems to appear healthier). For example, if someone responds “yes” to a number of\\nunrealistically positive items such as “I have never told a lie,” they may be trying to “fake good” or appear\\nbetter than they actually are.\\nReliability scales test an instrument’s consistency over time, assuring that if you take the MMPI-2-RF today and\\nthen again 5 years later, your two scores will be similar. Beutler, Nussbaum, and Meredith (1988) gave the\\nMMPI to newly recruited police officers and then to the same police officers 2 years later. After 2 years on the\\njob, police officers’ responses indicated an increased vulnerability to alcoholism, somatic symptoms (vague,\\nunexplained physical complaints), and anxiety. When the test was given an additional 2 years later (4 years\\nafter starting on the job), the results suggested high risk for alcohol-related difficulties.\\nProjective Tests\\nAnother method for assessment of personality is projective testing. This kind of test relies on one of the\\ndefense mechanisms proposed by Freud—projection—as a way to assess unconscious processes. During this\\ntype of testing, a series of ambiguous cards is shown to the person being tested, who then is encouraged to\\nproject their feelings, impulses, and desires onto the cards—by telling a story, interpreting an image, or\\ncompleting a sentence. Many projective tests have undergone standardization procedures (for example, Exner,\\n2002) and can be used to access whether someone has unusual thoughts or a high level of anxiety, or is likely\\nto become volatile. Some examples of projective tests are the Rorschach Inkblot Test, the Thematic\\nApperception Test (TAT), the Contemporized-Themes Concerning Blacks test, the TEMAS (Tell-Me-A-Story),\\nand the Rotter Incomplete Sentence Blank (RISB). Projective tests are less subject to intentional distortion; it is\\nhard to fake “good\" because it is not obvious what a \"good” answer is. Projective tests are more time\\nconsuming for the evaluator than self-report inventories. If an evaluator scores the Rorschach using the Exner\\nscoring system, the test is considered a valid and reliable measure. However, the validity of the other projective\\ntests is questionable, and the results are often not usable for court cases (Goldstein, n.d.).\\nThe Rorschach Inkblot Test was developed in 1921 by a Swiss psychologist named Hermann Rorschach\\n(pronounced “ROAR-shock”). It is a series of symmetrical inkblot cards that are presented to a client by a\\npsychologist. Upon presentation of each card, the psychologist asks the client, “What might this be?” What the\\ntest-taker sees reveals unconscious feelings and struggles (Piotrowski, 1987; Weiner, 2003). The Rorschach\\nhas been standardized using the Exner system and is effective in measuring depression, psychosis, and\\nanxiety.\\nA second projective test is the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT), created in the 1930s by Henry Murray, an\\nAmerican psychologist, and a psychoanalyst named Christiana Morgan. A person taking the TAT is shown\\n8–12 ambiguous pictures and is asked to tell a story about each picture (Figure 11.18). The stories give insight\\ninto their social world, revealing hopes, fears, interests, and goals. The storytelling format helps to lower a\\nperson’s resistance divulging unconscious personal details (Cramer, 2004). The TAT has been used in clinical\\nsettings to evaluate psychological disorders; more recently, it has been used in counseling settings to help\\nclients gain a better understanding of themselves and achieve personal growth. Standardization of test\\nadministration is virtually nonexistent among clinicians, and the test tends to be modest to low on validity and\\nreliability (Aronow, Weiss, & Rezinkoff, 2001; Lilienfeld, Wood, & Garb, 2000). Despite these shortcomings, the\\nTAT has been one of the most widely used projective tests.\\n388 11 • Personality\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nFIGURE 11.18 This image from the Thematic Apperception Tests (TAT) can be used in counseling settings.\\nA third projective test is the Rotter Incomplete Sentence Blank (RISB) developed by Julian Rotter in 1950\\n(recall his theory of locus of control, covered earlier in this chapter). There are three forms of this test for use\\nwith different age groups: the school form, the college form, and the adult form. The tests include 40\\nincomplete sentences that people are asked to complete as quickly as possible (Figure 11.19). The average\\ntime for completing the test is approximately 20 minutes, as responses are only 1–2 words in length. This test\\nis similar to a word association test, and like other types of projective tests, it is presumed that responses will\\nreveal desires, fears, and struggles. The RISB is used in screening college students for adjustment problems\\nand in career counseling (Holaday, Smith, & Sherry, 2010; Rotter & Rafferty 1950).\\nFIGURE 11.19 These incomplete sentences resemble the types of questions on the RISB. How would you complete\\nthese sentences?\\nFor many decades, these traditional projective tests have been used in cross-cultural personality assessments.\\nHowever, it was found that test bias limited their usefulness (Hoy-Watkins & Jenkins-Moore, 2008). It is\\ndifficult to assess the personalities and lifestyles of members of widely divergent ethnic/cultural groups using\\npersonality instruments based on data from a single culture or race (Hoy-Watkins & Jenkins-Moore, 2008). For\\nexample, when the TAT was used with African-American test takers, the result was often shorter story length\\nand low levels of cultural identification (Duzant, 2005). Therefore, it was vital to develop other personality\\nassessments that explored factors such as race, language, and level of acculturation (Hoy-Watkins & Jenkins-\\nMoore, 2008). To address this need, Robert Williams developed the first culturally specific projective test\\ndesigned to reflect the everyday life experiences of African Americans (Hoy-Watkins & Jenkins-Moore, 2008).\\nThe updated version of the instrument is the Contemporized-Themes Concerning Blacks Test (C-TCB)\\n(Williams, 1972). The C-TCB contains 20 color images that show scenes of African-American lifestyles. When\\nthe C-TCB was compared with the TAT for African Americans, it was found that use of the C-TCB led to\\nincreased story length, higher degrees of positive feelings, and stronger identification with the C-TCB (Hoy,\\n1997; Hoy-Watkins & Jenkins-Moore, 2008).\\n11.9 • Personality Assessment 389\\nThe TEMAS Multicultural Thematic Apperception Test is another tool designed to be culturally relevant to\\nminority groups, especially Hispanic youths. TEMAS—standing for “Tell Me a Story” but also a play on the\\nSpanish word temas (themes)—uses images and storytelling cues that relate to minority culture (Constantino,\\n1982).\\n390 11 • Personality\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nKey Terms\\nanal stage psychosexual stage in which children experience pleasure in their bowel and bladder movements\\nanalytical psychology Jung’s theory focusing on the balance of opposing forces within one’s personality and\\nthe significance of the collective unconscious\\narchetype pattern that exists in our collective unconscious across cultures and societies\\ncollective unconscious common psychological tendencies that have been passed down from one generation\\nto the next\\ncongruence state of being in which our thoughts about our real and ideal selves are very similar\\nconscious mental activity (thoughts, feelings, and memories) that we can access at any time\\nContemporized-Themes Concerning Blacks Test (C-TCB) projective test designed to be culturally relevant to\\nAfrican Americans, using images that relate to African-American culture\\nculture all of the beliefs, customs, art, and traditions of a particular society\\ndefense mechanism unconscious protective behaviors designed to reduce ego anxiety\\ndisplacement ego defense mechanism in which a person transfers inappropriate urges or behaviors toward a\\nmore acceptable or less threatening target\\nego aspect of personality that represents the self, or the part of one’s personality that is visible to others\\nFive Factor Model theory that personality is composed of five factors, including openness, conscientiousness,\\nextroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism\\ngenital stage psychosexual stage in which the focus is on mature sexual interests\\nheritability proportion of difference among people that is attributed to genetics\\nid aspect of personality that consists of our most primitive drives or urges, including impulses for hunger,\\nthirst, and sex\\nideal self person we would like to be\\nincongruence state of being in which there is a great discrepancy between our real and ideal selves\\nindividual psychology school of psychology proposed by Adler that focuses on our drive to compensate for\\nfeelings of inferiority\\ninferiority complex refers to a person’s feelings that they lack worth and don’t measure up to others’ or to\\nsociety’s standards\\nlatency period psychosexual stage in which sexual feelings are dormant\\nlocus of control beliefs about the power we have over our lives; an external locus of control is the belief that\\nour outcomes are outside of our control; an internal locus of control is the belief that we control our own\\noutcomes\\nMinnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) personality test composed of a series of true/false\\nquestions in order to establish a clinical profile of an individual\\nneurosis tendency to experience negative emotions\\noral stage psychosexual stage in which an infant’s pleasure is focused on the mouth\\npersonality long-standing traits and patterns that propel individuals to consistently think, feel, and behave in\\nspecific ways\\nphallic stage psychosexual stage in which the focus is on the genitals\\nprojection ego defense mechanism in which a person confronted with anxiety disguises their unacceptable\\nurges or behaviors by attributing them to other people\\nProjective test personality assessment in which a person responds to ambiguous stimuli, revealing hidden\\nfeelings, impulses, and desires\\npsychosexual stages of development stages of child development in which a child’s pleasure-seeking urges\\nare focused on specific areas of the body called erogenous zones\\nrationalization ego defense mechanism in which a person confronted with anxiety makes excuses to justify\\nbehavior\\nreaction formation ego defense mechanism in which a person confronted with anxiety swaps unacceptable\\nurges or behaviors for their opposites\\n11 • Key Terms 391\\n', 'answer': 'Answer VERY concisely from the provided context only.

While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember what he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is associated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend’s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John Nash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would tell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended for him. He also began to hear voices in his head that he could not control. When he tried to stop them, they would come back to him, and when he did not want them to, the voices would leave him (Wearing, n.d.). These are just a few of the many examples of how people experience the world around them in ways that are unpredictable and difficult to understand. In this chapter, we will explore what psychology is, what it is not, and how it has evolved over time. We will also look at some common misconceptions about psychology. Finally, we will discuss some careers in psychology and the role that psychology plays in our lives. 2. WHAT IS PSYCHOLOGY? The word “psychology” comes from two Greek words, “psyche” and “logos,” which mean “mind” or “thinking.” Psychologists are interested in how the mind works and how we think and feel. They study the mental processes that occur in the brain, such as perception, attention, memory, thinking, problem solving, emotion, motivation, learning, decision making, self-regulation, personality, social behavior, etc. Psychologists use a variety of methods to study these processes, including observation, experiments, surveys, interviews, questionnaires, brain imaging, neuropsychology, cognitive neuroscience, psychometrics, clinical psychology, developmental psychology, ethnopsychology and social psychology. Psychology has a long and rich history. It has been practiced for thousands of years in many different cultures and societies. For example, in ancient Greece, Plato and Aristotle studied psychology in order to understand the nature of human beings and their relationships with each other and with their environment. In the Middle Ages, Christian theologians and philosophers used psychology as a tool for understanding the nature of God and his relationship with his creatures. During the Renaissance, scientists and thinkers such as Galileo Galilei, Isaac Newton, René Descartes, John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Auguste Comte, Jean-Paul Sartre, Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, William James, Edward Thorndike, B.F. Skinner and others developed theories of psychology that continue to shape our understanding of this field today. Today, psychology is a broad and diverse field that encompasses a wide range of subfields and disciplines. Some of these disciplines include: • Clinical psychology: This field focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders, as well as', 'references': '{\"sections\": [\"Introduction to Psychology/Careers in Psychology\", \"Introduction to Psychology/Contemporary Psychology\", \"Social Psychology/What Is Social Psychology?\"], \"pages\": [\"29\", \"20\", \"401\"]}'}\n",

In addition to many\\nusual stresses and strains incidental to the college experience (e.g., exams and term papers), students today\\nare faced with increased college tuitions, burdensome debt, and difficulty finding employment after\\ngraduation. A significant population of non-traditional college students may face additional stressors, such as\\nraising children or holding down a full-time job while working toward a degree.\\nOf course, life is filled with many additional challenges beyond those incurred in college or the workplace. We\\nmight have concerns with financial security, difficulties with friends or neighbors, family responsibilities, and\\nwe may not have enough time to do the things we want to do. Even minor hassles—losing things, traffic jams,\\nand loss of internet service—all involve pressure and demands that can make life seem like a struggle and that\\ncan compromise our sense of well-being. That is, all can be stressful in some way.\\nScientific interest in stress, including how we adapt and cope, has been longstanding in psychology; indeed,\\nafter nearly a century of research on the topic, much has been learned and many insights have been\\ndeveloped. This chapter examines stress and highlights our current understanding of the phenomenon,\\nincluding its psychological and physiological natures, its causes and consequences, and the steps we can take\\nto master stress rather than become its victim.\\n14Stress, Lifestyle, and Health\\n14.1 What Is Stress?\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Differentiate between stimulus-based and response-based definitions of stress\\n• Define stress as a process\\n• Differentiate between good stress and bad stress\\n• Describe the early contributions of Walter Cannon and Hans Selye to the stress research field\\n• Understand the physiological basis of stress and describe the general adaptation syndrome\\nThe term stress as it relates to the human condition first emerged in scientific literature in the 1930s, but it did\\nnot enter the popular vernacular until the 1970s (Lyon, 2012). Today, we often use the term loosely in\\ndescribing a variety of unpleasant feeling states; for example, we often say we are stressed out when we feel\\nfrustrated, angry, conflicted, overwhelmed, or fatigued. Despite the widespread use of the term, stress is a\\nfairly vague concept that is difficult to define with precision.\\nResearchers have had a difficult time agreeing on an acceptable definition of stress. Some have conceptualized\\nstress as a demanding or threatening event or situation (e.g., a high-stress job, overcrowding, and long\\ncommutes to work). Such conceptualizations are known as stimulus-based definitions because they\\ncharacterize stress as a stimulus that causes certain reactions. Stimulus-based definitions of stress are\\nproblematic, however, because they fail to recognize that people differ in how they view and react to\\nchallenging life events and situations. For example, a conscientious student who has studied diligently all\\nsemester would likely experience less stress during final exams week than would a less responsible,\\nunprepared student.\\nOthers have conceptualized stress in ways that emphasize the physiological responses that occur when faced\\nwith demanding or threatening situations (e.g., increased arousal). These conceptualizations are referred to as\\nresponse-based definitions because they describe stress as a response to environmental conditions. For\\nexample, the endocrinologist Hans Selye, a famous stress researcher, once defined stress as the “response of\\nthe body to any demand, whether it is caused by, or results in, pleasant or unpleasant conditions” (Selye, 1976,\\np. 74). Selye’s definition of stress is response-based in that it conceptualizes stress chiefly in terms of the\\nbody’s physiological reaction to any demand that is placed on it. Neither stimulus-based nor response-based\\ndefinitions provide a complete definition of stress. Many of the physiological reactions that occur when faced\\nwith demanding situations (e.g., accelerated heart rate) can also occur in response to things that most people\\nwould not consider to be genuinely stressful, such as receiving unanticipated good news: an unexpected\\npromotion or raise.\\nA useful way to conceptualize stress is to view it as a process whereby an individual perceives and responds to\\nevents that they appraise as overwhelming or threatening to their well-being (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). A\\ncritical element of this definition is that it emphasizes the importance of how we appraise—that is,\\njudge—demanding or threatening events (often referred to as stressors); these appraisals, in turn, influence\\nour reactions to such events. Two kinds of appraisals of a stressor are especially important in this regard:\\nprimary and secondary appraisals. A primary appraisal involves judgment about the degree of potential harm\\nor threat to well-being that a stressor might entail. A stressor would likely be appraised as a threat if one\\nanticipates that it could lead to some kind of harm, loss, or other negative consequence; conversely, a stressor\\nwould likely be appraised as a challenge if one believes that it carries the potential for gain or personal growth.\\nFor example, an employee who is promoted to a leadership position would likely perceive the promotion as a\\nmuch greater threat if they believed the promotion would lead to excessive work demands than if they viewed\\nit as an opportunity to gain new skills and grow professionally. Similarly, a college student on the cusp of\\ngraduation may face the change as a threat or a challenge (Figure 14.2).\\n486 14 • Stress, Lifestyle, and Health\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nFIGURE 14.2 Graduating from college and entering the workforce can be viewed as either a threat (loss of financial\\nsupport) or a challenge (opportunity for independence and growth). (credit: Timothy Zanker)\\nThe perception of a threat triggers a secondary appraisal: judgment of the options available to cope with a\\nstressor, as well as perceptions of how effective such options will be (Lyon, 2012) (Figure 14.3). As you may\\nrecall from what you learned about self-efficacy, an individual’s belief in their ability to complete a task is\\nimportant (Bandura, 1994). A threat tends to be viewed as less catastrophic if one believes something can be\\ndone about it (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). Imagine that two middle-aged people, Robin and Madhuri, perform\\nbreast self-examinations one morning and each notices a lump on the lower region of their left breast.\\nAlthough both view the breast lump as a potential threat (primary appraisal), their secondary appraisals differ\\nconsiderably. In considering the breast lump, some of the thoughts racing through Robin’s mind are, “Oh my\\nGod, I could have breast cancer! What if the cancer has spread to the rest of my body and I cannot recover?\\nWhat if I have to go through chemotherapy? I’ve heard that experience is awful! What if I have to quit my job?\\nMy partner and I won’t have enough money to pay the mortgage. Oh, this is just horrible…I can’t deal with it!”\\nOn the other hand, Madhuri thinks, “Hmm, this may not be good. Although most times these things turn out to\\nbe benign, I need to have it checked out. If it turns out to be breast cancer, there are doctors who can take care\\nof it because the medical technology today is quite advanced. I’ll have a lot of different options, and I’ll be just\\nfine.” Clearly, Robin and Madhuri have different outlooks on what might turn out to be a very serious situation:\\nRobin seems to think that little could be done about it, whereas Madhuri believes that, worst case scenario, a\\nnumber of options that are likely to be effective would be available. As such, Robin would clearly experience\\ngreater stress than would Madhuri.\\n14.1 • What Is Stress? 487\\nFIGURE 14.3 When encountering a stressor, a person judges its potential threat (primary appraisal) and then\\ndetermines if effective options are available to manage the situation. Stress is likely to result if a stressor is\\nperceived as extremely threatening or threatening with few or no effective coping options available.\\nTo be sure, some stressors are inherently more stressful than others in that they are more threatening and\\nleave less potential for variation in cognitive appraisals (e.g., objective threats to one’s health or safety).\\nNevertheless, appraisal will still play a role in augmenting or diminishing our reactions to such events (Everly\\n& Lating, 2002).\\nIf a person appraises an event as harmful and believes that the demands imposed by the event exceed the\\navailable resources to manage or adapt to it, the person will subjectively experience a state of stress. In\\ncontrast, if one does not appraise the same event as harmful or threatening, she is unlikely to experience\\nstress. According to this definition, environmental events trigger stress reactions by the way they are\\ninterpreted and the meanings they are assigned. In short, stress is largely in the eye of the beholder: it’s not so\\nmuch what happens to you as it is how you respond (Selye, 1976).\\nGood Stress?\\nAlthough stress carries a negative connotation, at times it may be of some benefit. Stress can motivate us to do\\nthings in our best interests, such as study for exams, visit the doctor regularly, exercise, and perform to the\\nbest of our ability at work. Indeed, Selye (1974) pointed out that not all stress is harmful. He argued that stress\\n488 14 • Stress, Lifestyle, and Health\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\ncan sometimes be a positive, motivating force that can improve the quality of our lives. This kind of stress,\\nwhich Selye called eustress (from the Greek eu = “good”), is a good kind of stress associated with positive\\nfeelings, optimal health, and performance. A moderate amount of stress can be beneficial in challenging\\nsituations. For example, athletes may be motivated and energized by pregame stress, and students may\\nexperience similar beneficial stress before a major exam. Indeed, research shows that moderate stress can\\nenhance both immediate and delayed recall of educational material. Participants in one study who memorized\\na scientific text passage showed improved memory of the passage immediately after exposure to a mild\\nstressor as well as one day following exposure to the stressor (Hupbach & Fieman, 2012).\\nIncreasing one’s level of stress will cause performance to change in a predictable way. As shown in Figure 14.4,\\nas stress increases, so do performance and general well-being (eustress); when stress levels reach an optimal\\nlevel (the highest point of the curve), performance reaches its peak. A person at this stress level is colloquially\\nat the top of their game, meaning they feel fully energized, focused, and can work with minimal effort and\\nmaximum efficiency. But when stress exceeds this optimal level, it is no longer a positive force—it becomes\\nexcessive and debilitating, or what Selye termed distress (from the Latin dis = “bad”). People who reach this\\nlevel of stress feel burned out; they are fatigued, exhausted, and their performance begins to decline. If the\\nstress remains excessive, health may begin to erode as well (Everly & Lating, 2002). A good example of distress\\nis severe test anxiety. When students are feeling very stressed about a test, negative emotions combined with\\nphysical symptoms may make concentration difficult, thereby negatively affecting test scores.\\nFIGURE 14.4 As the stress level increases from low to moderate, so does performance (eustress). At the optimal\\nlevel (the peak of the curve), performance has reached its peak. If stress exceeds the optimal level, it will reach the\\ndistress region, where it will become excessive and debilitating, and performance will decline (Everly & Lating,\\n2002).\\nThe Prevalence of Stress\\nStress is everywhere and, as shown in Figure 14.5, it has been on the rise over the last several years. Each of us\\nis acquainted with stress—some are more familiar than others. In many ways, stress feels like a load you just\\ncan’t carry—a feeling you experience when, for example, you have to drive somewhere in a blizzard, when you\\nwake up late the morning of an important job interview, when you run out of money before the next pay\\nperiod, and before taking an important exam for which you realize you are not fully prepared.\\n14.1 • What Is Stress? 489\\nFIGURE 14.5 Nearly half of U.S. adults indicated that their stress levels have increased over the last five years\\n(Neelakantan, 2013).\\nStress is an experience that evokes a variety of responses, including those that are physiological (e.g.,\\naccelerated heart rate, headaches, or gastrointestinal problems), cognitive (e.g., difficulty concentrating or\\nmaking decisions), and behavioral (e.g., drinking alcohol, smoking, or taking actions directed at eliminating\\nthe cause of the stress). Although stress can be positive at times, it can have deleterious health implications,\\ncontributing to the onset and progression of a variety of physical illnesses and diseases (Cohen & Herbert,\\n1996).\\nThe scientific study of how stress and other psychological factors impact health falls within the realm of health\\npsychology, a subfield of psychology devoted to understanding the importance of psychological influences on\\nhealth, illness, and how people respond when they become ill (Taylor, 1999). Health psychology emerged as a\\ndiscipline in the 1970s, a time during which there was increasing awareness of the role behavioral and lifestyle\\nfactors play in the development of illnesses and diseases (Straub, 2007). In addition to studying the connection\\nbetween stress and illness, health psychologists investigate issues such as why people make certain lifestyle\\nchoices (e.g., smoking or eating unhealthy food despite knowing the potential adverse health implications of\\nsuch behaviors). Health psychologists also design and investigate the effectiveness of interventions aimed at\\nchanging unhealthy behaviors. Perhaps one of the more fundamental tasks of health psychologists is to\\nidentify which groups of people are especially at risk for negative health outcomes, based on psychological or\\nbehavioral factors. For example, measuring differences in stress levels among demographic groups and how\\nthese levels change over time can help identify populations who may have an increased risk for illness or\\ndisease.\\nFigure 14.6 depicts the results of three national surveys in which several thousand individuals from different\\ndemographic groups completed a brief stress questionnaire; the surveys were administered in 1983, 2006,\\nand 2009 (Cohen & Janicki-Deverts, 2012). All three surveys demonstrated higher stress in women than in\\nmen. Unemployed individuals reported high levels of stress in all three surveys, as did those with less\\neducation and income; retired persons reported the lowest stress levels. However, from 2006 to 2009 the\\ngreatest increase in stress levels occurred among men, Hispanic people aged 45–64, college graduates, and\\nthose with full-time employment. One interpretation of these findings is that concerns surrounding the\\n2008–2009 economic downturn (e.g., threat of or actual job loss and substantial loss of retirement savings)\\nmay have been especially stressful to college-educated employed men with limited time remaining in their\\nworking careers.\\n490 14 • Stress, Lifestyle, and Health\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nFIGURE 14.6 The charts above, adapted from Cohen & Janicki-Deverts (2012), depict the mean stress level scores\\namong different demographic groups during the years 1983, 2006, and 2009.

One of the early pioneers in the\\nstudy of stress was Walter Cannon, an eminent American physiologist at Harvard Medical School (Figure 14.7).\\nIn the early part of the 20th century, Cannon was the first to identify the body’s physiological reactions to\\nstress.\\n14.1 • What Is Stress? 491\\n', 'answer': 'Answer VERY concisely from the provided context only.

In addition to many usual stresses and strains incidental to the college experience (e.g., exams and term papers), students today are faced with increased college tuitions, burdensome debt, and difficulty finding employment after graduation. A significant population of non-traditional college students may face additional stressors, such as raising children or holding down a full-time job while working toward a degree. Of course, life is filled with many additional challenges beyond those incurred in college or the workplace. We might have concerns with financial security, difficulties with friends or neighbors, family responsibilities, and we may not have enough time to do the things we want to do. Even minor hassles—losing things, traffic jams, and loss of internet service—all involve pressure and demands that can make life seem like a struggle and that can compromise our sense of well-being and happiness. In this chapter, we will explore the concept of stress and how it relates to our daily lives. Stress is an emotional response to an event or situation that is perceived as harmful or threatening. It is a normal part of our lives and can be beneficial in certain situations. For example, stress can motivate us to work harder and to improve our performance. However, when stress becomes chronic, it can have negative effects on our mental and physical health. Stressors are the events or situations that cause stress. They may be internal or external. Internal stressors include problems at home, work, or school, as well as problems with relationships with family members and friends. Externally, they may include natural disasters, wars, political upheavals, natural disasters, financial problems, illness, death, divorce, job loss, etc. The term “stress” is often used interchangeably with “suffering,” but it is important to understand the differences between the two concepts. While suffering may involve physical or emotional pain and discomfort, stress is more than just physical pain or discomfort. When we experience stress, our bodies and minds respond in a variety of ways, including changes in our heart rate, blood pressure, breathing, digestion, immune system function, sleep patterns, energy levels, mood, appetite, memory, concentration, decision-making, etc. These changes can lead to a range of physical and mental health effects, ranging from mild discomfort to serious illness or even death. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to stress management. The key is to identify the specific stressor that is causing you to feel stressed and then to take steps to address it. There are many ways to manage stress, including relaxation techniques, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), mindfulness meditation, exercise, healthy diet, social support, time management, setting realistic goals and expectations, seeking professional help when needed, talking to trusted friends and family members about how you are feeling, getting enough sleep, eating a healthy diet, engaging in regular physical activity, practicing stress-reducing activities such as yoga, tai chi, deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, listening to music or listening to nature sounds, spending time with loved ones, reading a book, writing, playing a musical instrument, taking a hot bath or shower, going for a walk, watching a movie or TV show, doing crossword puzzles or other mentally stimulating activities', 'references': '{\"sections\": [\"Stress, Lifestyle, and Health/Stressors\"], \"pages\": [\"498\", \"500\", \"501\"]}'}\n",

This field of psychology is\\n316 9 • Summary\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nstudied by developmental psychologists. They view development as a lifelong process that can be studied\\nscientifically across three developmental domains: physical, cognitive development, and psychosocial. There\\nare several theories of development that focus on the following issues: whether development is continuous or\\ndiscontinuous, whether development follows one course or many, and the relative influence of nature versus\\nnurture on development.\\n9.2 Lifespan Theories\\nThere are many theories regarding how babies and children grow and develop into happy, healthy adults.\\nSigmund Freud suggested that we pass through a series of psychosexual stages in which our energy is focused\\non certain erogenous zones on the body. Eric Erikson modified Freud’s ideas and suggested a theory of\\npsychosocial development. Erikson said that our social interactions and successful completion of social tasks\\nshape our sense of self. Jean Piaget proposed a theory of cognitive development that explains how children\\nthink and reason as they move through various stages. Finally, Lawrence Kohlberg turned his attention to\\nmoral development. He said that we pass through three levels of moral thinking that build on our cognitive\\ndevelopment.\\n9.3 Stages of Development\\nAt conception the egg and sperm cell are united to form a zygote, which will begin to divide rapidly. This marks\\nthe beginning of the first stage of prenatal development (germinal stage), which lasts about two weeks. Then\\nthe zygote implants itself into the lining of the uterus, marking the beginning of the second stage of prenatal\\ndevelopment (embryonic stage), which lasts about six weeks. The embryo begins to develop body and organ\\nstructures, and the neural tube forms, which will later become the brain and spinal cord. The third phase of\\nprenatal development (fetal stage) begins at 9 weeks and lasts until birth. The body, brain, and organs grow\\nrapidly during this stage. During all stages of pregnancy it is important that the parent receive prenatal care to\\nreduce health risks to themself and to the developing baby.\\nNewborn infants weigh about 7.5 pounds. Doctors assess a newborn’s reflexes, such as the sucking, rooting,\\nand Moro reflexes. Our physical, cognitive, and psychosocial skills grow and change as we move through\\ndevelopmental stages from infancy through late adulthood. Attachment in infancy is a critical component of\\nhealthy development. Parenting styles have been found to have an effect on childhood outcomes of well-being.\\nThe transition from adolescence to adulthood can be challenging due to the timing of puberty, and due to the\\nextended amount of time spent in emerging adulthood. Although physical decline begins in middle adulthood,\\ncognitive decline does not begin until later. Activities that keep the body and mind active can help maintain\\ngood physical and cognitive health as we age. Social supports through family and friends remain important as\\nwe age.\\n9.4 Death and Dying\\nDeath marks the endpoint of our lifespan. There are many ways that we might react when facing death. Kübler-\\nRoss developed a five-stage model of grief as a way to explain this process. Many people facing death choose\\nhospice care, which allows their last days to be spent at home in a comfortable, supportive environment.\\nReview Questions\\n1.

The information in our unconscious affects our behavior, although we\\nare unaware of it.\\nAccording to Freud, our personality develops from a conflict between two forces: our biological aggressive and\\npleasure-seeking drives versus our internal (socialized) control over these drives. Our personality is the result\\nof our efforts to balance these two competing forces. Freud suggested that we can understand this by\\nimagining three interacting systems within our minds. He called them the id, ego, and superego (Figure 11.6).\\nFIGURE 11.6 The job of the ego, or self, is to balance the aggressive/pleasure-seeking drives of the id with the\\nmoral control of the superego.\\nThe unconscious id contains our most primitive drives or urges, and is present from birth. It directs impulses\\nfor hunger, thirst, and sex. Freud believed that the id operates on what he called the “pleasure principle,” in\\nwhich the id seeks immediate gratification. Through social interactions with parents and others in a child’s\\nenvironment, the ego and superego develop to help control the id. The superego develops as a child interacts\\nwith others, learning the social rules for right and wrong. The superego acts as our conscience; it is our moral\\ncompass that tells us how we should behave. It strives for perfection and judges our behavior, leading to\\nfeelings of pride or—when we fall short of the ideal—feelings of guilt. In contrast to the instinctual id and the\\nrule-based superego, the ego is the rational part of our personality. It’s what Freud considered to be the self,\\nand it is the part of our personality that is seen by others. Its job is to balance the demands of the id and\\nsuperego in the context of reality; thus, it operates on what Freud called the “reality principle.” The ego helps\\nthe id satisfy its desires in a realistic way.\\nThe id and superego are in constant conflict, because the id wants instant gratification regardless of the\\nconsequences, but the superego tells us that we must behave in socially acceptable ways. Thus, the ego’s job is\\nto find the middle ground. It helps satisfy the id’s desires in a rational way that will not lead us to feelings of\\nguilt. According to Freud, a person who has a strong ego, which can balance the demands of the id and the\\nsuperego, has a healthy personality. Freud maintained that imbalances in the system can lead to neurosis (a\\ntendency to experience negative emotions), anxiety disorders, or unhealthy behaviors. For example, a person\\nwho is dominated by their id might be narcissistic and impulsive. A person with a dominant superego might be\\ncontrolled by feelings of guilt and deny themselves even socially acceptable pleasures; conversely, if the\\nsuperego is weak or absent, a person might become a psychopath. An overly dominant superego might be seen\\nin an over-controlled individual whose rational grasp on reality is so strong that they are unaware of their\\nemotional needs, or, in a neurotic who is overly defensive (overusing ego defense mechanisms).\\nDefense Mechanisms\\nFreud believed that feelings of anxiety result from the ego’s inability to mediate the conflict between the id and\\nsuperego. When this happens, Freud believed that the ego seeks to restore balance through various protective\\nmeasures known as defense mechanisms (Figure 11.7). When certain events, feelings, or yearnings cause an\\nindividual anxiety, the individual wishes to reduce that anxiety. To do that, the individual’s unconscious mind\\nuses ego defense mechanisms, unconscious protective behaviors that aim to reduce anxiety. The ego, usually\\n364 11 • Personality\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nconscious, resorts to unconscious strivings to protect the ego from being overwhelmed by anxiety. When we\\nuse defense mechanisms, we are unaware that we are using them. Further, they operate in various ways that\\ndistort reality. According to Freud, we all use ego defense mechanisms.\\nFIGURE 11.7 Defense mechanisms are unconscious protective behaviors that work to reduce anxiety.\\nWhile everyone uses defense mechanisms, Freud believed that overuse of them may be problematic. For\\nexample, let’s say Joe is a high school football player. Deep down, Joe feels sexually attracted to males. His\\nconscious belief is that being gay is immoral and that if he were gay, his family would disown him and he would\\nbe ostracized by his peers. Therefore, there is a conflict between his conscious beliefs (being gay is wrong and\\n11.2 • Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective 365\\nwill result in being ostracized) and his unconscious urges (attraction to males). The idea that he might be gay\\ncauses Joe to have feelings of anxiety. How can he decrease his anxiety? Joe may find himself acting very\\n“macho,” making gay jokes, and picking on a school peer who is gay. This way, Joe’s unconscious impulses are\\nfurther submerged.\\nThere are several different types of defense mechanisms. For instance, in repression, anxiety-causing\\nmemories from consciousness are blocked. As an analogy, let’s say your car is making a strange noise, but\\nbecause you do not have the money to get it fixed, you just turn up the radio so that you no longer hear the\\nstrange noise. Eventually you forget about it. Similarly, in the human psyche, if a memory is too overwhelming\\nto deal with, it might be repressed and thus removed from conscious awareness (Freud, 1920). This repressed\\nmemory might cause symptoms in other areas.\\nAnother defense mechanism is reaction formation, in which someone expresses feelings, thoughts, and\\nbehaviors opposite to their inclinations. In the above example, Joe made fun of a gay peer while himself being\\nattracted to males. In regression, an individual acts much younger than their age. For example, a four-year-old\\nchild who resents the arrival of a newborn sibling may act like a baby and revert to drinking out of a bottle. In\\nprojection, a person refuses to acknowledge her own unconscious feelings and instead sees those feelings in\\nsomeone else. Other defense mechanisms include rationalization, displacement, and sublimation.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nWatch this video of Freud's defense mechanisms (http://openstax.org/l/defmech) to review.\\nStages of Psychosexual Development\\nFreud believed that personality develops during early childhood: Childhood experiences shape our\\npersonalities as well as our behavior as adults. He asserted that we develop via a series of stages during\\nchildhood. Each of us must pass through these childhood stages, and if we do not have the proper nurturing\\nand parenting during a stage, we will be stuck, or fixated, in that stage, even as adults.\\nIn each psychosexual stage of development, the child’s pleasure-seeking urges, coming from the id, are\\nfocused on a different area of the body, called an erogenous zone. The stages are oral, anal, phallic, latency, and\\ngenital (Table 11.1).\\nFreud’s psychosexual development theory is quite controversial. To understand the origins of the theory, it is\\nhelpful to be familiar with the political, social, and cultural influences of Freud’s day in Vienna at the turn of\\nthe 20th century. During this era, a climate of sexual repression, combined with limited understanding and\\neducation surrounding human sexuality, heavily influenced Freud’s perspective. Given that sex was a taboo\\ntopic, Freud assumed that negative emotional states (neuroses) stemmed from suppression of unconscious\\nsexual and aggressive urges. For Freud, his own recollections and interpretations of patients’ experiences and\\ndreams were sufficient proof that psychosexual stages were universal events in early childhood.\\nFreud’s Stages of Psychosexual Development\\nStage Age (years) Erogenous Zone Major Conflict Adult Fixation Example\\nOral 0–1 Mouth Weaning off breast or bottle Smoking, overeating\\nAnal 1–3 Anus Toilet training Neatness, messiness\\nPhallic 3–6 Genitals Oedipus/Electra complex Vanity, overambition\\nLatency 6–12 None None None\\nTABLE 11.1\\n366 11 • Personality\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nStage Age (years) Erogenous Zone Major Conflict Adult Fixation Example\\nGenital 12+ Genitals None None\\nTABLE 11.1\\nOral Stage\\nIn the oral stage (birth to 1 year), pleasure is focused on the mouth. Eating and the pleasure derived from\\nsucking (nipples, pacifiers, and thumbs) play a large part in a baby’s first year of life. At around 1 year of age,\\nbabies are weaned from the bottle or breast, and this process can create conflict if not handled properly by\\ncaregivers. According to Freud, an adult who smokes, drinks, overeats, or bites her nails is fixated in the oral\\nstage of her psychosexual development; she may have been weaned too early or too late, resulting in these\\nfixation tendencies, all of which seek to ease anxiety.\\nAnal Stage\\nAfter passing through the oral stage, children enter what Freud termed the anal stage (1–3 years). In this stage,\\nchildren experience pleasure in their bowel and bladder movements, so it makes sense that the conflict in this\\nstage is over toilet training. During this stage of development, children work to master control of themselves.\\nFreud suggested that success at the anal stage depended on how parents handled toilet training. Parents who\\noffer praise and rewards encourage positive results and can help children feel competent. Parents who are\\nharsh in toilet training can cause a child to become so fearful of soiling that they over-control and become\\nfixated at the anal stage, leading to the development of an anal-retentive personality. The anal-retentive\\npersonality is stingy and stubborn, has a compulsive need for order and neatness, and might be considered a\\nperfectionist. If parents are too lenient in toilet training, the child may fail to develop sufficient self-control,\\nbecome fixated at this stage, and develop an anal-expulsive personality. The anal-expulsive personality is\\nmessy, careless, disorganized, and prone to emotional outbursts.\\nPhallic Stage\\nFreud’s third stage of psychosexual development is the phallic stage (3–6 years), corresponding to the age\\nwhen children become aware of their bodies and recognize the differences between boys and girls. The\\nerogenous zone in this stage is the genitals. Conflict arises when the child feels a desire for the opposite-sex\\nparent, and jealousy and hatred toward the same-sex parent. For boys, this is called the Oedipus complex,\\ninvolving a boy's desire for his mother and his urge to replace his father who is seen as a rival for the mother’s\\nattention. At the same time, the boy is afraid his father will punish him for his feelings, so he experiences\\ncastration anxiety. The Oedipus complex is successfully resolved when the boy begins to identify with his\\nfather as an indirect way to have the mother. Failure to resolve the Oedipus complex may result in fixation and\\ndevelopment of a personality that might be described as vain and overly ambitious.\\nGirls experience a comparable conflict in the phallic stage—the Electra complex. The Electra complex, while\\noften attributed to Freud, was actually proposed by Freud’s protégé, Carl Jung (Jung & Kerenyi, 1963). A girl\\ndesires the attention of her father and wishes to take her mother’s place. Jung also said that girls are angry\\nwith the mother for not providing them with a penis—which he termed penis envy. While Freud initially\\nembraced the Electra complex as a parallel to the Oedipus complex, he later rejected it, yet it remains as a\\ncornerstone of Freudian theory, thanks in part to academics in the field (Freud, 1931/1968; Scott, 2005).\\nLatency Period\\nFollowing the phallic stage of psychosexual development is a period known as the latency period (6 years to\\npuberty). This period is not considered a stage, because sexual feelings are dormant as children focus on other\\npursuits, such as school, friendships, hobbies, and sports. Children generally engage in activities with peers of\\nthe same sex, which serves to consolidate a child’s gender-role identity.\\n11.2 • Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective 367\\nGenital Stage\\nThe final stage is the genital stage (from puberty on). In this stage, there is a sexual reawakening as the\\nincestuous urges resurface. The young person redirects these urges to other, more socially acceptable partners\\n(who often resemble the other-sex parent). People in this stage have mature sexual interests, which for Freud\\nmeant a strong desire for the opposite sex. Individuals who successfully completed the previous stages,\\nreaching the genital stage with no fixations, are said to be well-balanced, healthy adults.\\nWhile most of Freud’s ideas have not found support in modern research, and several contemporary\\nresearchers rejected his premises, we cannot discount the contributions that Freud has made to the field of\\npsychology. It was Freud who pointed out that a large part of our mental life is influenced by the experiences of\\nearly childhood and takes place outside of our conscious awareness; his theories paved the way for others.\\nWhile Freud's focus on biological drives led him to emphasize the impact of sociocultural factors on\\npersonality development, his followers quickly realized that biology alone could not account for the diversity\\nthey encountered as the practice of psychoanalysis spread during the time of the Nazi Holocaust. The\\nantisemitism which was prevalent during this period of time may have led mainstream psychoanalysts to\\nfocus primarily on the universality of the psychological structures of the mind.\\n11.3 Neo-Freudians: Adler, Erikson, Jung, and Horney\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Discuss the concept of the inferiority complex\\n• Discuss the core differences between Erikson’s and Freud’s views on personality\\n• Discuss Jung’s ideas of the collective unconscious and archetypes\\n• Discuss the work of Karen Horney, including her revision of Freud’s “penis envy”\\nFreud attracted many followers who modified his ideas to create new theories about personality. These\\ntheorists, referred to as neo-Freudians, generally agreed with Freud that childhood experiences matter, but\\ndeemphasized sex, focusing more on the social environment and effects of culture on personality. Four notable\\nneo-Freudians include Alfred Adler, Erik Erikson, Carl Jung (pronounced “Yoong”), and Karen Horney\\n(pronounced “HORN-eye”).\\nAlfred Adler\\nAlfred Adler, a colleague of Freud’s and the first president of the Vienna Psychoanalytical Society (Freud’s\\ninner circle of colleagues), was the first major theorist to break away from Freud (Figure 11.8). He\\nsubsequently founded a school of psychology called individual psychology, which focuses on our drive to\\ncompensate for feelings of inferiority. Adler (1937, 1956) proposed the concept of the inferiority complex. An\\ninferiority complex refers to a person’s feelings that they lack worth and don’t measure up to the standards of\\nothers or of society. Adler’s ideas about inferiority represent a major difference between his thinking and\\nFreud’s. Freud believed that we are motivated by sexual and aggressive urges, but Adler (1930, 1961) believed\\nthat feelings of inferiority in childhood are what drive people to attempt to gain superiority and that this\\nstriving is the force behind all of our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.\\n368 11 • Personality\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nFIGURE 11.18 This image from the Thematic Apperception Tests (TAT) can be used in counseling settings.\\nA third projective test is the Rotter Incomplete Sentence Blank (RISB) developed by Julian Rotter in 1950\\n(recall his theory of locus of control, covered earlier in this chapter). There are three forms of this test for use\\nwith different age groups: the school form, the college form, and the adult form. The tests include 40\\nincomplete sentences that people are asked to complete as quickly as possible (Figure 11.19). The average\\ntime for completing the test is approximately 20 minutes, as responses are only 1–2 words in length. This test\\nis similar to a word association test, and like other types of projective tests, it is presumed that responses will\\nreveal desires, fears, and struggles. The RISB is used in screening college students for adjustment problems\\nand in career counseling (Holaday, Smith, & Sherry, 2010; Rotter & Rafferty 1950).\\nFIGURE 11.19 These incomplete sentences resemble the types of questions on the RISB. How would you complete\\nthese sentences?\\nFor many decades, these traditional projective tests have been used in cross-cultural personality assessments.\\nHowever, it was found that test bias limited their usefulness (Hoy-Watkins & Jenkins-Moore, 2008). It is\\ndifficult to assess the personalities and lifestyles of members of widely divergent ethnic/cultural groups using\\npersonality instruments based on data from a single culture or race (Hoy-Watkins & Jenkins-Moore, 2008). For\\nexample, when the TAT was used with African-American test takers, the result was often shorter story length\\nand low levels of cultural identification (Duzant, 2005). Therefore, it was vital to develop other personality\\nassessments that explored factors such as race, language, and level of acculturation (Hoy-Watkins & Jenkins-\\nMoore, 2008). To address this need, Robert Williams developed the first culturally specific projective test\\ndesigned to reflect the everyday life experiences of African Americans (Hoy-Watkins & Jenkins-Moore, 2008).\\nThe updated version of the instrument is the Contemporized-Themes Concerning Blacks Test (C-TCB)\\n(Williams, 1972). The C-TCB contains 20 color images that show scenes of African-American lifestyles. When\\nthe C-TCB was compared with the TAT for African Americans, it was found that use of the C-TCB led to\\nincreased story length, higher degrees of positive feelings, and stronger identification with the C-TCB (Hoy,\\n1997; Hoy-Watkins & Jenkins-Moore, 2008).\\n11.9 • Personality Assessment 389\\nThe TEMAS Multicultural Thematic Apperception Test is another tool designed to be culturally relevant to\\nminority groups, especially Hispanic youths.

More recent theories of\\npersonality have been proposed, including Freud’s psychodynamic perspective, which holds that personality is\\nformed through early childhood experiences. Other perspectives then emerged in reaction to the\\npsychodynamic perspective, including the learning, humanistic, biological, trait, and cultural perspectives.\\n11.2 Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective\\nSigmund Freud presented the first comprehensive theory of personality. He was also the first to recognize that\\nmuch of our mental life takes place outside of our conscious awareness. Freud also proposed three\\ncomponents to our personality: the id, ego, and superego. The job of the ego is to balance the sexual and\\naggressive drives of the id with the moral ideal of the superego. Freud also said that personality develops\\nthrough a series of psychosexual stages. In each stage, pleasure focuses on a specific erogenous zone. Failure\\nto resolve a stage can lead one to become fixated in that stage, leading to unhealthy personality traits.\\nSuccessful resolution of the stages leads to a healthy adult.\\n11.3 Neo-Freudians: Adler, Erikson, Jung, and Horney\\nThe neo-Freudians were psychologists whose work followed from Freud’s. They generally agreed with Freud\\nthat childhood experiences matter, but they decreased the emphasis on sex and focused more on the social\\n392 11 • Summary\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nenvironment and effects of culture on personality. Some of the notable neo-Freudians are Alfred Adler, Carl\\nJung, Erik Erikson, and Karen Horney. The neo-Freudian approaches have been criticized, because they tend\\nto be philosophical rather than based on sound scientific research. For example, Jung’s conclusions about the\\nexistence of the collective unconscious are based on myths, legends, dreams, and art. In addition, as with\\nFreud’s psychoanalytic theory, the neo-Freudians based much of their theories of personality on information\\nfrom their patients.\\n11.4 Learning Approaches\\nBehavioral theorists view personality as significantly shaped and impacted by the reinforcements and\\nconsequences outside of the organism. People behave in a consistent manner based on prior learning. B. F.\\nSkinner, a prominent behaviorist, said that we demonstrate consistent behavior patterns, because we have\\ndeveloped certain response tendencies. Mischel focused on how personal goals play a role in the self-\\nregulation process. Albert Bandura said that one’s environment can determine behavior, but at the same time,\\npeople can influence the environment with both their thoughts and behaviors, which is known as reciprocal\\ndeterminism. Bandura also emphasized how we learn from watching others. He felt that this type of learning\\nalso plays a part in the development of our personality. Bandura discussed the concept of self-efficacy, which is\\nour level of confidence in our own abilities. Finally, Rotter proposed the concept of locus of control, which\\nrefers to our beliefs about the power we have over our lives. He said that people fall along a continuum between\\na purely internal and a purely external locus of control.\\n11.5 Humanistic Approaches\\nHumanistic psychologists Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers focused on the growth potential of healthy\\nindividuals. They believed that people strive to become self-actualized. Both Rogers’s and Maslow’s theories\\ngreatly contributed to our understanding of the self. They emphasized free will and self-determination, with\\neach individual desiring to become the best person they can become.\\n11.6 Biological Approaches\\nSome aspects of our personalities are largely controlled by genetics; however, environmental factors (such as\\nfamily interactions) and maturation can affect the ways in which children’s personalities are expressed.\\n11.7 Trait Theorists\\nTrait theorists attempt to explain our personality by identifying our stable characteristics and ways of\\nbehaving. They have identified important dimensions of personality. The Five Factor Model is the most widely\\naccepted theory today. The five factors are openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and\\nneuroticism. These factors occur along a continuum.\\n11.8 Cultural Understandings of Personality\\nThe culture in which you live is one of the most important environmental factors that shapes your personality.\\nWestern ideas about personality may not be applicable to other cultures. In fact, there is evidence that the\\nstrength of personality traits varies across cultures. Individualist cultures and collectivist cultures place\\nemphasis on different basic values. People who live in individualist cultures tend to believe that independence,\\ncompetition, and personal achievement are important. People who live in collectivist cultures value social\\nharmony, respectfulness, and group needs over individual needs. There are three approaches that can be used\\nto study personality in a cultural context: the cultural-comparative approach, the indigenous approach, and\\nthe combined approach, which incorporates both elements of both views.\\n11.9 Personality Assessment\\nPersonality tests are techniques designed to measure one’s personality. They are used to diagnose\\npsychological problems as well as to screen candidates for college and employment. There are two types of\\npersonality tests: self-report inventories and projective tests. The MMPI is one of the most common self-report\\n11 • Summary 393\\n\", 'answer': 'Answer VERY concisely from the provided context only. Your answer length: less or equal 150 tokens.

A random sample is a subset\\nof a larger population in which every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected.\\nRandom samples are preferred because if the sample is large enough we can be reasonably sure that the\\nparticipating individuals are representative of the larger population. This means that the percentages of\\ncharacteristics in the sample—sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic level, and any other characteristics that might\\naffect the results—are close to those percentages in the larger population.\\nIn our example, let’s say we decide our population of interest is algebra students. But all algebra students is a\\nvery large population, so we need to be more specific; instead we might say our population of interest is all\\nalgebra students in a particular city. We should include students from various income brackets, family\\nsituations, races, ethnicities, religions, and geographic areas of town. With this more manageable population,\\nwe can work with the local schools in selecting a random sample of around 200 algebra students who we want\\nto participate in our experiment.\\nIn summary, because we cannot test all of the algebra students in a city, we want to find a group of about 200\\nthat reflects the composition of that city. With a representative group, we can generalize our findings to the\\nlarger population without fear of our sample being biased in some way.\\nFIGURE 2.18 Researchers may work with (a) a large population or (b) a sample group that is a subset of the larger\\npopulation. (credit “crowd”: modification of work by James Cridland; credit “students”: modification of work by\\nLaurie Sullivan)\\nNow that we have a sample, the next step of the experimental process is to split the participants into\\nexperimental and control groups through random assignment. With random assignment, all participants\\nhave an equal chance of being assigned to either group. There is statistical software that will randomly assign\\neach of the algebra students in the sample to either the experimental or the control group.\\nRandom assignment is critical for sound experimental design. With sufficiently large samples, random\\nassignment makes it unlikely that there are systematic differences between the groups. So, for instance, it\\nwould be very unlikely that we would get one group composed entirely of males, a given ethnic identity, or a\\ngiven religious ideology. This is important because if the groups were systematically different before the\\nexperiment began, we would not know the origin of any differences we find between the groups: Were the\\ndifferences preexisting, or were they caused by manipulation of the independent variable? Random\\nassignment allows us to assume that any differences observed between experimental and control groups\\nresult from the manipulation of the independent variable.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nUse this online random number generator (http://openstax.org/l/rannumbers) to learn more about random\\nsampling and assignments.\\nIssues to Consider\\nWhile experiments allow scientists to make cause-and-effect claims, they are not without problems. True\\n2.3 • Analyzing Findings 55\\nexperiments require the experimenter to manipulate an independent variable, and that can complicate many\\nquestions that psychologists might want to address. For instance, imagine that you want to know what effect\\nsex (the independent variable) has on spatial memory (the dependent variable). Although you can certainly\\nlook for differences between males and females on a task that taps into spatial memory, you cannot directly\\ncontrol a person’s sex. We categorize this type of research approach as quasi-experimental and recognize that\\nwe cannot make cause-and-effect claims in these circumstances.\\nExperimenters are also limited by ethical constraints. For instance, you would not be able to conduct an\\nexperiment designed to determine if experiencing abuse as a child leads to lower levels of self-esteem among\\nadults. To conduct such an experiment, you would need to randomly assign some experimental participants to\\na group that receives abuse, and that experiment would be unethical.\\nInterpreting Experimental Findings\\nOnce data is collected from both the experimental and the control groups, a statistical analysis is conducted to\\nfind out if there are meaningful differences between the two groups. A statistical analysis determines how\\nlikely any difference found is due to chance (and thus not meaningful). For example, if an experiment is done\\non the effectiveness of a nutritional supplement, and those taking a placebo pill (and not the supplement) have\\nthe same result as those taking the supplement, then the experiment has shown that the nutritional\\nsupplement is not effective. Generally, psychologists consider differences to be statistically significant if there\\nis less than a five percent chance of observing them if the groups did not actually differ from one another.\\nStated another way, psychologists want to limit the chances of making “false positive” claims to five percent or\\nless.\\nThe greatest strength of experiments is the ability to assert that any significant differences in the findings are\\ncaused by the independent variable. This occurs because random selection, random assignment, and a design\\nthat limits the effects of both experimenter bias and participant expectancy should create groups that are\\nsimilar in composition and treatment. Therefore, any difference between the groups is attributable to the\\nindependent variable, and now we can finally make a causal statement. If we find that watching a violent\\ntelevision program results in more violent behavior than watching a nonviolent program, we can safely say\\nthat watching violent television programs causes an increase in the display of violent behavior.\\nReporting Research\\nWhen psychologists complete a research project, they generally want to share their findings with other\\nscientists. The American Psychological Association (APA) publishes a manual detailing how to write a paper for\\nsubmission to scientific journals. Unlike an article that might be published in a magazine like Psychology\\nToday, which targets a general audience with an interest in psychology, scientific journals generally publish\\npeer-reviewed journal articles aimed at an audience of professionals and scholars who are actively involved\\nin research themselves.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nThe Online Writing Lab (OWL) (http://openstax.org/l/owl) at Purdue University can walk you through the APA\\nwriting guidelines.\\nA peer-reviewed journal article is read by several other scientists (generally anonymously) with expertise in\\nthe subject matter. These peer reviewers provide feedback—to both the author and the journal\\neditor—regarding the quality of the draft. Peer reviewers look for a strong rationale for the research being\\ndescribed, a clear description of how the research was conducted, and evidence that the research was\\nconducted in an ethical manner. They also look for flaws in the study's design, methods, and statistical\\nanalyses. They check that the conclusions drawn by the authors seem reasonable given the observations made\\nduring the research. Peer reviewers also comment on how valuable the research is in advancing the\\n56 2 • Psychological Research\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\ndiscipline’s knowledge. This helps prevent unnecessary duplication of research findings in the scientific\\nliterature and, to some extent, ensures that each research article provides new information. Ultimately, the\\njournal editor will compile all of the peer reviewer feedback and determine whether the article will be\\npublished in its current state (a rare occurrence), published with revisions, or not accepted for publication.\\nPeer review provides some degree of quality control for psychological research. Poorly conceived or executed\\nstudies can be weeded out, and even well-designed research can be improved by the revisions suggested. Peer\\nreview also ensures that the research is described clearly enough to allow other scientists to replicate it,\\nmeaning they can repeat the experiment using different samples to determine reliability. Sometimes\\nreplications involve additional measures that expand on the original finding. In any case, each replication\\nserves to provide more evidence to support the original research findings. Successful replications of published\\nresearch make scientists more apt to adopt those findings, while repeated failures tend to cast doubt on the\\nlegitimacy of the original article and lead scientists to look elsewhere. For example, it would be a major\\nadvancement in the medical field if a published study indicated that taking a new drug helped individuals\\nachieve a healthy weight without changing their diet. But if other scientists could not replicate the results, the\\noriginal study’s claims would be questioned.\\nIn recent years, there has been increasing concern about a “replication crisis” that has affected a number of\\nscientific fields, including psychology. Some of the most well-known studies and scientists have produced\\nresearch that has failed to be replicated by others (as discussed in Shrout & Rodgers, 2018). In fact, even a\\nfamous Nobel Prize-winning scientist has recently retracted a published paper because she had difficulty\\nreplicating her results (Nobel Prize-winning scientist Frances Arnold retracts paper, 2020 January 3). These\\nkinds of outcomes have prompted some scientists to begin to work together and more openly, and some would\\nargue that the current “crisis” is actually improving the ways in which science is conducted and in how its\\nresults are shared with others (Aschwanden, 2018).\\nThe Vaccine-Autism Myth and Retraction of Published Studies\\nSome scientists have claimed that routine childhood vaccines cause some children to develop autism, and, in\\nfact, several peer-reviewed publications published research making these claims. Since the initial reports, large-\\nscale epidemiological research has indicated that vaccinations are not responsible for causing autism and that it\\nis much safer to have your child vaccinated than not. Furthermore, several of the original studies making this\\nclaim have since been retracted.\\nA published piece of work can be rescinded when data is called into question because of falsification, fabrication,\\nor serious research design problems. Once rescinded, the scientific community is informed that there are serious\\nproblems with the original publication. Retractions can be initiated by the researcher who led the study, by\\nresearch collaborators, by the institution that employed the researcher, or by the editorial board of the journal in\\nwhich the article was originally published. In the vaccine-autism case, the retraction was made because of a\\nsignificant conflict of interest in which the leading researcher had a financial interest in establishing a link\\nbetween childhood vaccines and autism (Offit, 2008). Unfortunately, the initial studies received so much media\\nattention that many parents around the world became hesitant to have their children vaccinated (Figure 2.19).\\nContinued reliance on such debunked studies has significant consequences. For instance, between January and\\nOctober of 2019, there were 22 measles outbreaks across the United States and more than a thousand cases of\\nindividuals contracting measles (Patel et al., 2019). This is likely due to the anti-vaccination movements that\\nhave risen from the debunked research. For more information about how the vaccine/autism story unfolded, as\\nwell as the repercussions of this story, take a look at Paul Offit’s book, Autism’s False Prophets: Bad Science,\\nRisky Medicine, and the Search for a Cure.\\nDIG DEEPER\\n2.3 • Analyzing Findings 57\\nFIGURE 2.19 Some people still think vaccinations cause autism. (credit: modification of work by UNICEF\\nSverige)\\nReliability and Validity\\nReliability and validity are two important considerations that must be made with any type of data collection.\\nReliability refers to the ability to consistently produce a given result. In the context of psychological research,\\nthis would mean that any instruments or tools used to collect data do so in consistent, reproducible ways.\\nThere are a number of different types of reliability. Some of these include inter-rater reliability (the degree to\\nwhich two or more different observers agree on what has been observed), internal consistency (the degree to\\nwhich different items on a survey that measure the same thing correlate with one another), and test-retest\\nreliability (the degree to which the outcomes of a particular measure remain consistent over multiple\\nadministrations).\\nUnfortunately, being consistent in measurement does not necessarily mean that you have measured\\nsomething correctly. To illustrate this concept, consider a kitchen scale that would be used to measure the\\nweight of cereal that you eat in the morning. If the scale is not properly calibrated, it may consistently under-\\nor overestimate the amount of cereal that’s being measured. While the scale is highly reliable in producing\\nconsistent results (e.g., the same amount of cereal poured onto the scale produces the same reading each\\ntime), those results are incorrect. This is where validity comes into play. Validity refers to the extent to which a\\ngiven instrument or tool accurately measures what it’s supposed to measure, and once again, there are a\\nnumber of ways in which validity can be expressed. Ecological validity (the degree to which research results\\ngeneralize to real-world applications), construct validity (the degree to which a given variable actually captures\\nor measures what it is intended to measure), and face validity (the degree to which a given variable seems valid\\non the surface) are just a few types that researchers consider. While any valid measure is by necessity reliable,\\nthe reverse is not necessarily true. Researchers strive to use instruments that are both highly reliable and\\nvalid.\\n58 2 • Psychological Research\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nHow Valid Are the SAT and ACT?\\nStandardized tests like the SAT and ACT are supposed to measure an individual’s aptitude for a college\\neducation, but how reliable and valid are such tests? Research conducted by the College Board suggests that\\nscores on the SAT have high predictive validity for first-year college students’ GPA (Kobrin, Patterson, Shaw,\\nMattern, & Barbuti, 2008). In this context, predictive validity refers to the test’s ability to effectively predict the\\nGPA of college freshmen. Given that many institutions of higher education require the SAT or ACT for admission,\\nthis high degree of predictive validity might be comforting.\\nHowever, the emphasis placed on SAT or ACT scores in college admissions is changing based on a number of\\nfactors. For one, some researchers assert that these tests are biased, and students from historically marginalized\\npopulations are at a disadvantage that unfairly reduces the likelihood of being admitted into a college (Santelices\\n& Wilson, 2010). Additionally, some research has suggested that the predictive validity of these tests is grossly\\nexaggerated in how well they are able to predict the GPA of first-year college students. In fact, it has been\\nsuggested that the SAT’s predictive validity may be overestimated by as much as 150% (Rothstein, 2004). Many\\ninstitutions of higher education are beginning to consider de-emphasizing the significance of SAT scores in\\nmaking admission decisions (Rimer, 2008).\\nRecent examples of high profile cheating scandals both domestically and abroad have only increased the scrutiny\\nbeing placed on these types of tests, and as of March 2019, more than 1000 institutions of higher education have\\neither relaxed or eliminated the requirements for SAT or ACT testing for admissions (Strauss, 2019, March 19).\\n2.4 Ethics\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Discuss how research involving human subjects is regulated\\n• Summarize the processes of informed consent and debriefing\\n• Explain how research involving animal subjects is regulated\\nToday, scientists agree that good research is ethical in nature and is guided by a basic respect for human\\ndignity and safety. However, as you will read in the feature box, this has not always been the case. Modern\\nresearchers must demonstrate that the research they perform is ethically sound. This section presents how\\nethical considerations affect the design and implementation of research conducted today.\\nResearch Involving Human Participants\\nAny experiment involving the participation of human subjects is governed by extensive, strict guidelines\\ndesigned to ensure that the experiment does not result in harm. Any research institution that receives federal\\nsupport for research involving human participants must have access to an institutional review board (IRB).\\nThe IRB is a committee of individuals often made up of members of the institution’s administration, scientists,\\nand community members (Figure 2.20). The purpose of the IRB is to review proposals for research that\\ninvolves human participants. The IRB reviews these proposals with the principles mentioned above in mind,\\nand generally, approval from the IRB is required in order for the experiment to proceed.\\nEVERYDAY CONNECTION\\n2.4 • Ethics 59\\nKey Terms\\narchival research method of research using past records or data sets to answer various research questions, or\\nto search for interesting patterns or relationships\\nattrition reduction in number of research participants as some drop out of the study over time\\ncause-and-effect relationship changes in one variable cause the changes in the other variable;

Theories that\\nstand up to their tests are retained and refined, while those that do not are discarded or modified. In this way,\\nresearch enables scientists to separate fact from simple opinion. Having good information generated from\\nresearch aids in making wise decisions both in public policy and in our personal lives.\\n2.2 Approaches to Research\\nThe clinical or case study involves studying just a few individuals for an extended period of time. While this\\napproach provides an incredible depth of information, the ability to generalize these observations to the larger\\npopulation is problematic. Naturalistic observation involves observing behavior in a natural setting and allows\\n64 2 • Summary\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nfor the collection of valid, true-to-life information from realistic situations. However, naturalistic observation\\ndoes not allow for much control and often requires quite a bit of time and money to perform. Researchers\\nstrive to ensure that their tools for collecting data are both reliable (consistent and replicable) and valid\\n(accurate).\\nSurveys can be administered in a number of ways and make it possible to collect large amounts of data quickly.\\nHowever, the depth of information that can be collected through surveys is somewhat limited compared to a\\nclinical or case study.\\nArchival research involves studying existing data sets to answer research questions.\\nLongitudinal research has been incredibly helpful to researchers who need to collect data on how people\\nchange over time. Cross-sectional research compares multiple segments of a population at a single time.\\n2.3 Analyzing Findings\\nA correlation is described with a correlation coefficient, r, which ranges from -1 to 1. The correlation\\ncoefficient tells us about the nature (positive or negative) and the strength of the relationship between two or\\nmore variables. Correlations do not tell us anything about causation—regardless of how strong the relationship\\nis between variables. In fact, the only way to demonstrate causation is by conducting an experiment. People\\noften make the mistake of claiming that correlations exist when they really do not.\\nResearchers can test cause-and-effect hypotheses by conducting experiments. Ideally, experimental\\nparticipants are randomly selected from the population of interest. Then, the participants are randomly\\nassigned to their respective groups. Sometimes, the researcher and the participants are blind to group\\nmembership to prevent their expectations from influencing the results.\\nIn ideal experimental design, the only difference between the experimental and control groups is whether\\nparticipants are exposed to the experimental manipulation. Each group goes through all phases of the\\nexperiment, but each group will experience a different level of the independent variable: the experimental\\ngroup is exposed to the experimental manipulation, and the control group is not exposed to the experimental\\nmanipulation. The researcher then measures the changes that are produced in the dependent variable in each\\ngroup. Once data is collected from both groups, it is analyzed statistically to determine if there are meaningful\\ndifferences between the groups.\\nPsychologists report their research findings in peer-reviewed journal articles. Research published in this\\nformat is checked by several other psychologists who serve as a filter separating ideas that are supported by\\nevidence from ideas that are not. Replication has an important role in ensuring the legitimacy of published\\nresearch. In the long run, only those findings that are capable of being replicated consistently will achieve\\nconsensus in the scientific community.\\n2.4 Ethics\\nEthics in research is an evolving field, and some practices that were accepted or tolerated in the past would be\\nconsidered unethical today. Researchers are expected to adhere to basic ethical guidelines when conducting\\nexperiments that involve human participants. Any experiment involving human participants must be\\napproved by an IRB. Participation in experiments is voluntary and requires informed consent of the\\nparticipants. If any deception is involved in the experiment, each participant must be fully debriefed upon the\\nconclusion of the study.\\nAnimal research is also held to a high ethical standard. Researchers who use animals as experimental subjects\\nmust design their projects so that pain and distress are minimized. Animal research requires the approval of\\nan IACUC, and all animal facilities are subject to regular inspections to ensure that animals are being treated\\nhumanely.\\n2 • Summary 65\\nReview Questions\\n1.

Other molecules, such as chloride ions (yellow circles) and negatively charged\\nproteins (brown squares), help contribute to a positive net charge in the extracellular fluid and a negative net charge\\nin the intracellular fluid.\\nFrom this resting potential state, the neuron receives a signal and its state changes abruptly (Figure 3.11).\\nWhen a neuron receives signals at the dendrites—due to neurotransmitters from an adjacent neuron binding\\nto its receptors—small pores, or gates, open on the neuronal membrane, allowing Na+ ions, propelled by both\\ncharge and concentration differences, to move into the cell. With this influx of positive ions, the internal\\ncharge of the cell becomes more positive. If that charge reaches a certain level, called the threshold of\\nexcitation, the neuron becomes active and the action potential begins.\\nMany additional pores open, causing a massive influx of Na+ ions and a huge positive spike in the membrane\\npotential, the peak action potential. At the peak of the spike, the sodium gates close and the potassium gates\\nopen. As positively charged potassium ions leave, the cell quickly begins repolarization.

The action potential moves\\n3.2 • Cells of the Nervous System 81\\nall the way down the axon in this fashion until reaching the terminal buttons.\\nThe action potential is an all-or-none phenomenon. In simple terms, this means that an incoming signal from\\nanother neuron is either sufficient or insufficient to reach the threshold of excitation. There is no in-between,\\nand there is no turning off an action potential once it starts. Think of it like sending an email or a text message.\\nYou can think about sending it all you want, but the message is not sent until you hit the send button.\\nFurthermore, once you send the message, there is no stopping it.\\nBecause it is all or none, the action potential is recreated, or propagated, at its full strength at every point along\\nthe axon. Much like the lit fuse of a firecracker, it does not fade away as it travels down the axon. It is this all-or-\\nnone property that explains the fact that your brain perceives an injury to a distant body part like your toe as\\nequally painful as one to your nose.\\nAs noted earlier, when the action potential arrives at the terminal button, the synaptic vesicles release their\\nneurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitters travel across the synapse and bind to\\nreceptors on the dendrites of the adjacent neuron, and the process repeats itself in the new neuron (assuming\\nthe signal is sufficiently strong to trigger an action potential). Once the signal is delivered, excess\\nneurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft drift away, are broken down into inactive fragments, or are reabsorbed\\nin a process known as reuptake. Reuptake involves the neurotransmitter being pumped back into the neuron\\nthat released it, in order to clear the synapse (Figure 3.12). Clearing the synapse serves both to provide a clear\\n“on” and “off” state between signals and to regulate the production of neurotransmitter (full synaptic vesicles\\nprovide signals that no additional neurotransmitters need to be produced).\\nFIGURE 3.12 Reuptake involves moving a neurotransmitter from the synapse back into the axon terminal from\\nwhich it was released.\\nNeuronal communication is often referred to as an electrochemical event. The movement of the action\\npotential down the length of the axon is an electrical event, and movement of the neurotransmitter across the\\nsynaptic space represents the chemical portion of the process. However, there are some specialized\\nconnections between neurons that are entirely electrical. In such cases, the neurons are said to communicate\\nvia an electrical synapse. In these cases, two neurons physically connect to one another via gap junctions,\\nwhich allows the current from one cell to pass into the next. There are far fewer electrical synapses in the\\nbrain, but those that do exist are much faster than the chemical synapses that have been described above\\n(Connors & Long, 2004).\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nWatch this video about neuronal communication (http://openstax.org/l/neuroncom) to learn more.\\n82 3 • Biopsychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nNeurotransmitters and Drugs\\nThere are several different types of neurotransmitters released by different neurons, and we can speak in\\nbroad terms about the kinds of functions associated with different neurotransmitters (Table 3.1). Much of what\\npsychologists know about the functions of neurotransmitters comes from research on the effects of drugs in\\npsychological disorders. Psychologists who take a biological perspective and focus on the physiological\\ncauses of behavior assert that psychological disorders like depression and schizophrenia are associated with\\nimbalances in one or more neurotransmitter systems. In this perspective, psychotropic medications can help\\nimprove the symptoms associated with these disorders. Psychotropic medications are drugs that treat\\npsychiatric symptoms by restoring neurotransmitter balance.\\nMajor Neurotransmitters and How They Affect Behavior\\nNeurotransmitter Involved in Potential Effect on Behavior\\nAcetylcholine Muscle action, memory Increased arousal, enhanced cognition\\nBeta-endorphin Pain, pleasure Decreased anxiety, decreased tension\\nDopamine Mood, sleep, learning Increased pleasure, suppressed appetite\\nGamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) Brain function, sleep Decreased anxiety, decreased tension\\nGlutamate Memory, learning Increased learning, enhanced memory\\nNorepinephrine Heart, intestines, alertness Increased arousal, suppressed appetite\\nSerotonin Mood, sleep Modulated mood, suppressed appetite\\nTABLE 3.1\\nPsychoactive drugs can act as agonists or antagonists for a given neurotransmitter system. Agonists are\\nchemicals that mimic a neurotransmitter at the receptor site. An antagonist, on the other hand, blocks or\\nimpedes the normal activity of a neurotransmitter at the receptor. Agonists and antagonists represent drugs\\nthat are prescribed to correct the specific neurotransmitter imbalances underlying a person’s condition. For\\nexample, Parkinson's disease, a progressive nervous system disorder, is associated with low levels of\\ndopamine. Therefore, a common treatment strategy for Parkinson's disease involves using dopamine agonists,\\nwhich mimic the effects of dopamine by binding to dopamine receptors.\\nCertain symptoms of schizophrenia are associated with overactive dopamine neurotransmission. The\\nantipsychotics used to treat these symptoms are antagonists for dopamine—they block dopamine’s effects by\\nbinding its receptors without activating them. Thus, they prevent dopamine released by one neuron from\\nsignaling information to adjacent neurons.\\nIn contrast to agonists and antagonists, which both operate by binding to receptor sites, reuptake inhibitors\\nprevent unused neurotransmitters from being transported back to the neuron. This allows neurotransmitters\\nto remain active in the synaptic cleft for longer durations, increasing their effectiveness. Depression, which\\nhas been consistently linked with reduced serotonin levels, is commonly treated with selective serotonin\\nreuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). By preventing reuptake, SSRIs strengthen the effect of serotonin, giving it more\\ntime to interact with serotonin receptors on dendrites. Common SSRIs on the market today include Prozac,\\nPaxil, and Zoloft. The drug LSD is structurally very similar to serotonin, and it affects the same neurons and\\nreceptors as serotonin. Psychotropic drugs are not instant solutions for people suffering from psychological\\ndisorders. Often, an individual must take a drug for several weeks before seeing improvement, and many\\n3.2 • Cells of the Nervous System 83\\npsychoactive drugs have significant negative side effects. Furthermore, individuals vary dramatically in how\\nthey respond to the drugs. To improve chances for success, it is not uncommon for people receiving\\npharmacotherapy to undergo psychological and/or behavioral therapies as well. Some research suggests that\\ncombining drug therapy with other forms of therapy tends to be more effective than any one treatment alone\\n(for one such example, see March et al., 2007).\\n3.3 Parts of the Nervous System\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Describe the difference between the central and peripheral nervous systems\\n• Explain the difference between the somatic and autonomic nervous systems\\n• Differentiate between the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system\\nThe nervous system can be divided into two major subdivisions: the central nervous system (CNS) and the\\nperipheral nervous system (PNS), shown in Figure 3.13. The CNS is comprised of the brain and spinal cord;\\nthe PNS connects the CNS to the rest of the body. In this section, we focus on the peripheral nervous system;\\nlater, we look at the brain and spinal cord.\\nFIGURE 3.13 The nervous system is divided into two major parts: (a) the Central Nervous System and (b) the\\nPeripheral Nervous System.\\nPeripheral Nervous System\\nThe peripheral nervous system is made up of thick bundles of axons, called nerves, carrying messages back\\nand forth between the CNS and the muscles, organs, and senses in the periphery of the body (i.e., everything\\noutside the CNS). The PNS has two major subdivisions: the somatic nervous system and the autonomic\\n84 3 • Biopsychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nnervous system.\\nThe somatic nervous system is associated with activities traditionally thought of as conscious or voluntary. It\\nis involved in the relay of sensory and motor information to and from the CNS; therefore, it consists of motor\\nneurons and sensory neurons. Motor neurons, carrying instructions from the CNS to the muscles, are efferent\\nfibers (efferent means “moving away from”). Sensory neurons, carrying sensory information to the CNS, are\\nafferent fibers (afferent means “moving toward”). A helpful way to remember this is that efferent = exit and\\nafferent = arrive. Each nerve is basically a bundle of neurons forming a two-way superhighway, containing\\nthousands of axons, both efferent and afferent.\\nThe autonomic nervous system controls our internal organs and glands and is generally considered to be\\noutside the realm of voluntary control. It can be further subdivided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic\\ndivisions (Figure 3.14). The sympathetic nervous system is involved in preparing the body for stress-related\\nactivities; the parasympathetic nervous system is associated with returning the body to routine, day-to-day\\noperations. The two systems have complementary functions, operating in tandem to maintain the body’s\\nhomeostasis. Homeostasis is a state of equilibrium, or balance, in which biological conditions (such as body\\ntemperature) are maintained at optimal levels.\\nFIGURE 3.14 The sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system have the opposite\\neffects on various systems.\\nThe sympathetic nervous system is activated when we are faced with stressful or high-arousal situations. The\\nactivity of this system was adaptive for our ancestors, increasing their chances of survival. Imagine, for\\nexample, that one of our early ancestors, out hunting small game, suddenly disturbs a large bear with her cubs.\\nAt that moment, the hunter's body undergoes a series of changes—a direct function of sympathetic\\nactivation—preparing them to face the threat. The pupils dilate, the heart rate and blood pressure increase, the\\nbladder relaxes, and the liver releases glucose; adrenaline surges into the bloodstream.

The goal of treatment is not to change whom a person is, but to address symptoms and/or\\nunderlying conditions.\\n16.1 Mental Health Treatment: Past and Present\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Explain how people with psychological disorders have been treated throughout the ages\\n• Discuss deinstitutionalization\\n• Discuss the ways in which mental health services are delivered today\\n• Distinguish between voluntary and involuntary treatment\\nBefore we explore the various approaches to therapy used today, let’s begin our study of therapy by looking at\\nhow many people experience mental illness and how many receive treatment. According to the U.S.\\nDepartment of Health and Human Services (2017), 18.9% of U.S. adults experienced mental illness in 2017.\\nFor teens (ages 13–18), the rate is similar to that of adults, and for children ages 8–15, current estimates\\nsuggest that approximately 13% experience mental illness in a given year (National Institute of Mental Health\\n[NIMH], 2017).\\nWith many different treatment options available, approximately how many people receive mental health\\ntreatment per year? According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA),\\nin 2017, 14.8% of adults received treatment for a mental health issue (NIMH, 2017). These percentages, shown\\nin Figure 16.2, reflect the number of adults who received care in inpatient and outpatient settings and/or used\\nprescription medication for psychological disorders.\\nFIGURE 16.2 The percentage of adults who received mental health treatment in 2004–2008 is shown. Adults\\nseeking treatment increased slightly from 2004 to 2008.\\nChildren and adolescents also receive mental health services. The Centers for Disease Control and\\nPrevention's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) found that approximately half\\n(50.6%) of children with mental disorders had received treatment for their disorder within the past year\\n(NIMH, n.d.). However, there were some differences between treatment rates by category of disorder (Figure\\n16.3). For example, children with anxiety disorders were least likely to have received treatment in the past\\nyear, while children with ADHD or a conduct disorder were more likely to receive treatment. Can you think of\\nsome possible reasons for these differences in receiving treatment?\\n600 16 • Therapy and Treatment\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nFIGURE 16.3 About one-third to one-half of U.S. adolescents (ages 8–15) with mental disorders receive treatment,\\nwith behavior-related disorders more likely to be treated.\\nConsidering the many forms of treatment for mental health disorders available today, how did these forms of\\ntreatment emerge? Let’s take a look at the history of mental health treatment from the past (with some\\nquestionable approaches in light of modern understanding of mental illness) to where we are today.\\nTreatment in the Past\\nFor much of history, people with mental illness have been treated very poorly. It was believed that mental\\nillness was caused by demonic possession, witchcraft, or an angry god (Szasz, 1960). For example, in medieval\\ntimes, abnormal behaviors were viewed as a sign that a person was possessed by demons. If someone was\\nconsidered to be possessed, there were several forms of treatment to release spirits from the individual. The\\nmost common treatment was exorcism, often conducted by priests or other religious figures: Incantations and\\nprayers were said over the person’s body, and they may have been given some medicinal drinks. Another form\\nof treatment for extreme cases of mental illness was trephining: A small hole was made in the afflicted\\nindividual’s skull to release spirits from the body. Most people treated in this manner died. In addition to\\nexorcism and trephining, other practices involved execution or imprisonment of people with psychological\\ndisorders. Still others were left to be homeless beggars. Generally speaking, most people who exhibited strange\\nbehaviors were greatly misunderstood and treated cruelly. The prevailing theory of psychopathology in earlier\\nhistory was the idea that mental illness was the result of demonic possession by either an evil spirit or an evil\\ngod because early beliefs incorrectly attributed all unexplainable phenomena to deities deemed either good or\\nevil.\\nFrom the late 1400s to the late 1600s, a common belief perpetuated by some religious organizations was that\\nsome people made pacts with the devil and committed horrible acts, such as eating babies (Blumberg, 2007).\\nThese people were considered to be witches and were tried and condemned by courts—they were often burned\\nat the stake. Worldwide, it is estimated that tens of thousands of mentally ill people were killed after being\\naccused of being witches or under the influence of witchcraft (Hemphill, 1966)\\nBy the 18th century, people who were considered odd and unusual were placed in asylums (Figure 16.4).\\nAsylums were the first institutions created for the specific purpose of housing people with psychological\\ndisorders, but the focus was ostracizing them from society rather than treating their disorders. Often these\\npeople were kept in windowless dungeons, beaten, chained to their beds, and had little to no contact with\\ncaregivers.\\n16.1 • Mental Health Treatment: Past and Present 601\\n\", 'answer': 'Answer VERY concisely from the provided context only.

The action potential moves 3.2 • Cells of the Central Nervous System The central nervous system (CNS), which includes the brain and spinal cord, is the body’s control center. It receives and processes information from sensory organs and sends signals to muscles and glands, as well as executes commands from higher brain centers. The CNS is divided into two main parts: The brain, which contains the cerebrum, cerebellum and brainstem, and is responsible for controlling voluntary movements, including breathing, heart rate, blood pressure, eye movement, swallowing, speaking, etc., and is also involved in learning and memory; and The Spinal Cord, which is made up of four pairs of spinal nerves, each of which controls a specific muscle or group of muscles. In the CNS, there are two types of neurons: Sensory neurons and Motor neurons. Sensory Neurons A sensory neuron is a nerve cell that receives information about the environment and transmits it to other nerve cells. These cells are called sensory neurons because they receive sensory information (such as light, sound, smell, taste, temperature, pain, touch, vibration, pressure) from their surroundings and transmit that information along their axons (the long, thin extensions of nerve cells that carry electrical and chemical signals from one neuron to another) to their target cells (neurons that receive the information and transmit it). The target cell is called a motor neuron, because it receives the signal from a sensory neuron and uses that signal to control the movement of a muscle, gland, organ or organ system. Motor Neuron Motor neurons are also called motor neurons, but they are different from other neurons in that they do not receive sensory signals. Instead, they transmit signals that tell the muscle to contract or relax. They are also called effector neurons. This is because the signals they send are used to cause the contraction or relaxation of certain muscles. For example, when a person touches a hot stove, his or her muscles contract and the blood flow to those muscles increases. When the person leaves the stove and moves away from it, the muscle relaxes. In this way, afferent signals are converted into motor signals and sent to motor Neurons are the basic building blocks of all nervous systems. There are about 86 billion neurons (about 200 million per person) in a human brain. Each of these neurons is connected to at least one other neuron through a synapse.

Learning how the body's\\ncells and organs function can help us understand the biological basis of human psychology. The nervous\\nsystem is composed of two basic cell types: glial cells (also known as glia) and neurons. Glial cells are\\ntraditionally thought to play a supportive role to neurons, both physically and metabolically. Glial cells provide\\nscaffolding on which the nervous system is built, help neurons line up closely with each other to allow\\nneuronal communication, provide insulation to neurons, transport nutrients and waste products, and mediate\\nimmune responses. For years, researchers believed that there were many more glial cells than neurons;\\nhowever, more recent work from Suzanna Herculano-Houzel's laboratory has called this long-standing\\nassumption into question and has provided important evidence that there may be a nearly 1:1 ratio of glia cells\\nto neurons. This is important because it suggests that human brains are more similar to other primate brains\\nthan previously thought (Azevedo et al, 2009; Herculano-Houzel, 2012; Herculano-Houzel, 2009).

Like all cells,\\nneurons consist of several different parts, each serving a specialized function (Figure 3.8). A neuron’s outer\\nsurface is made up of a semipermeable membrane. This membrane allows smaller molecules and molecules\\nwithout an electrical charge to pass through it, while stopping larger or highly charged molecules.\\nFIGURE 3.8 This illustration shows a prototypical neuron, which is being myelinated by a glial cell.\\nThe nucleus of the neuron is located in the soma, or cell body. The soma has branching extensions known as\\ndendrites. The neuron is a small information processor, and dendrites serve as input sites where signals are\\nreceived from other neurons. These signals are transmitted electrically across the soma and down a major\\nextension from the soma known as the axon, which ends at multiple terminal buttons. The terminal buttons\\ncontain synaptic vesicles that house neurotransmitters, the chemical messengers of the nervous system.\\nAxons range in length from a fraction of an inch to several feet. In some axons, glial cells form a fatty substance\\nknown as the myelin sheath, which coats the axon and acts as an insulator, increasing the speed at which the\\nsignal travels. The myelin sheath is not continuous and there are small gaps that occur down the length of the\\naxon. These gaps in the myelin sheath are known as the Nodes of Ranvier. The myelin sheath is crucial for the\\nnormal operation of the neurons within the nervous system: the loss of the insulation it provides can be\\ndetrimental to normal function. To understand how this works, let’s consider an example. PKU, a genetic\\ndisorder discussed earlier, causes a reduction in myelin and abnormalities in white matter cortical and\\nsubcortical structures. The disorder is associated with a variety of issues including severe cognitive deficits,\\nexaggerated reflexes, and seizures (Anderson & Leuzzi, 2010; Huttenlocher, 2000). Another disorder, multiple\\nsclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disorder, involves a large-scale loss of the myelin sheath on axons throughout\\nthe nervous system. The resulting interference in the electrical signal prevents the quick transmittal of\\ninformation by neurons and can lead to a number of symptoms, such as dizziness, fatigue, loss of motor\\ncontrol, and sexual dysfunction. While some treatments may help to modify the course of the disease and\\nmanage certain symptoms, there is currently no known cure for multiple sclerosis.\\nIn healthy individuals, the neuronal signal moves rapidly down the axon to the terminal buttons, where\\nsynaptic vesicles release neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft (Figure 3.9). The synaptic cleft is a very\\nsmall space between two neurons and is an important site where communication between neurons occurs.\\nOnce neurotransmitters are released into the synaptic cleft, they travel across it and bind with corresponding\\nreceptors on the dendrite of an adjacent neuron. Receptors, proteins on the cell surface where\\nneurotransmitters attach, vary in shape, with different shapes “matching” different neurotransmitters.\\nHow does a neurotransmitter “know” which receptor to bind to? The neurotransmitter and the receptor have\\n3.2 • Cells of the Nervous System 79\\nwhat is referred to as a lock-and-key relationship—specific neurotransmitters fit specific receptors similar to\\nhow a key fits a lock. The neurotransmitter binds to any receptor that it fits.\\nFIGURE 3.9 (a) The synaptic cleft is the space between the terminal button of one neuron and the dendrite of\\nanother neuron. (b) In this pseudo-colored image from a scanning electron microscope, a terminal button (green)\\nhas been opened to reveal the synaptic vesicles (orange and blue) inside. Each vesicle contains about 10,000\\nneurotransmitter molecules. (credit b: modification of work by Tina Carvalho, NIH-NIGMS; scale-bar data from Matt\\nRussell)\\nNeuronal Communication\\nNow that we have learned about the basic structures of the neuron and the role that these structures play in\\nneuronal communication, let’s take a closer look at the signal itself—how it moves through the neuron and then\\njumps to the next neuron, where the process is repeated.\\nWe begin at the neuronal membrane. The neuron exists in a fluid environment—it is surrounded by\\nextracellular fluid and contains intracellular fluid (i.e., cytoplasm). The neuronal membrane keeps these two\\nfluids separate—a critical role because the electrical signal that passes through the neuron depends on the\\nintra- and extracellular fluids being electrically different. This difference in charge across the membrane,\\ncalled the membrane potential, provides energy for the signal.\\nThe electrical charge of the fluids is caused by charged molecules (ions) dissolved in the fluid. The\\nsemipermeable nature of the neuronal membrane somewhat restricts the movement of these charged\\nmolecules, and, as a result, some of the charged particles tend to become more concentrated either inside or\\noutside the cell.\\nBetween signals, the neuron membrane’s potential is held in a state of readiness, called the resting potential.\\nLike a rubber band stretched out and waiting to spring into action, ions line up on either side of the cell\\nmembrane, ready to rush across the membrane when the neuron goes active and the membrane opens its\\ngates. Ions in high-concentration areas are ready to move to low-concentration areas, and positive ions are\\nready to move to areas with a negative charge.\\nIn the resting state, sodium (Na+) is at higher concentrations outside the cell, so it will tend to move into the\\ncell. Potassium (K+), on the other hand, is more concentrated inside the cell, and will tend to move out of the\\ncell (Figure 3.10). In addition, the inside of the cell is slightly negatively charged compared to the outside, due\\nto the activity of the sodium-potassium pump. This pump actively transports three sodium ions out of the cell\\nfor every two potassium ions in, creating a net negative charge inside the cell. This provides an additional\\nforce on sodium, causing it to move into the cell.\\n80 3 • Biopsychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nFIGURE 3.10 At resting potential, Na+ (blue pentagons) is more highly concentrated outside the cell in the\\nextracellular fluid (shown in blue), whereas K+ (purple squares) is more highly concentrated near the membrane in\\nthe cytoplasm or intracellular fluid. Other molecules, such as chloride ions (yellow circles) and negatively charged\\nproteins (brown squares), help contribute to a positive net charge in the extracellular fluid and a negative net charge\\nin the intracellular fluid.\\nFrom this resting potential state, the neuron receives a signal and its state changes abruptly (Figure 3.11).\\nWhen a neuron receives signals at the dendrites—due to neurotransmitters from an adjacent neuron binding\\nto its receptors—small pores, or gates, open on the neuronal membrane, allowing Na+ ions, propelled by both\\ncharge and concentration differences, to move into the cell. With this influx of positive ions, the internal\\ncharge of the cell becomes more positive. If that charge reaches a certain level, called the threshold of\\nexcitation, the neuron becomes active and the action potential begins.\\nMany additional pores open, causing a massive influx of Na+ ions and a huge positive spike in the membrane\\npotential, the peak action potential. At the peak of the spike, the sodium gates close and the potassium gates\\nopen. As positively charged potassium ions leave, the cell quickly begins repolarization. At first, it\\nhyperpolarizes, becoming slightly more negative than the resting potential, and then it levels off, returning to\\nthe resting potential.\\nFIGURE 3.11 During the action potential, the electrical charge across the membrane changes dramatically.\\nThis positive spike constitutes the action potential: the electrical signal that typically moves from the cell body\\ndown the axon to the axon terminals. The electrical signal moves down the axon with the impulses jumping in\\na leapfrog fashion between the Nodes of Ranvier. The Nodes of Ranvier are natural gaps in the myelin sheath.\\nAt each point, some of the sodium ions that enter the cell diffuse to the next section of the axon, raising the\\ncharge past the threshold of excitation and triggering a new influx of sodium ions. The action potential moves\\n3.2 • Cells of the Nervous System 81\\nall the way down the axon in this fashion until reaching the terminal buttons.\\nThe action potential is an all-or-none phenomenon. In simple terms, this means that an incoming signal from\\nanother neuron is either sufficient or insufficient to reach the threshold of excitation. There is no in-between,\\nand there is no turning off an action potential once it starts. Think of it like sending an email or a text message.\\nYou can think about sending it all you want, but the message is not sent until you hit the send button.\\nFurthermore, once you send the message, there is no stopping it.\\nBecause it is all or none, the action potential is recreated, or propagated, at its full strength at every point along\\nthe axon. Much like the lit fuse of a firecracker, it does not fade away as it travels down the axon. It is this all-or-\\nnone property that explains the fact that your brain perceives an injury to a distant body part like your toe as\\nequally painful as one to your nose.\\nAs noted earlier, when the action potential arrives at the terminal button, the synaptic vesicles release their\\nneurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitters travel across the synapse and bind to\\nreceptors on the dendrites of the adjacent neuron, and the process repeats itself in the new neuron (assuming\\nthe signal is sufficiently strong to trigger an action potential). Once the signal is delivered, excess\\nneurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft drift away, are broken down into inactive fragments, or are reabsorbed\\nin a process known as reuptake. Reuptake involves the neurotransmitter being pumped back into the neuron\\nthat released it, in order to clear the synapse (Figure 3.12). Clearing the synapse serves both to provide a clear\\n“on” and “off” state between signals and to regulate the production of neurotransmitter (full synaptic vesicles\\nprovide signals that no additional neurotransmitters need to be produced).\\nFIGURE 3.12 Reuptake involves moving a neurotransmitter from the synapse back into the axon terminal from\\nwhich it was released.\\nNeuronal communication is often referred to as an electrochemical event. The movement of the action\\npotential down the length of the axon is an electrical event, and movement of the neurotransmitter across the\\nsynaptic space represents the chemical portion of the process. However, there are some specialized\\nconnections between neurons that are entirely electrical. In such cases, the neurons are said to communicate\\nvia an electrical synapse. In these cases, two neurons physically connect to one another via gap junctions,\\nwhich allows the current from one cell to pass into the next. There are far fewer electrical synapses in the\\nbrain, but those that do exist are much faster than the chemical synapses that have been described above\\n(Connors & Long, 2004).\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nWatch this video about neuronal communication (http://openstax.org/l/neuroncom) to learn more.\\n82 3 • Biopsychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nNeurotransmitters and Drugs\\nThere are several different types of neurotransmitters released by different neurons, and we can speak in\\nbroad terms about the kinds of functions associated with different neurotransmitters (Table 3.1). Much of what\\npsychologists know about the functions of neurotransmitters comes from research on the effects of drugs in\\npsychological disorders. Psychologists who take a biological perspective and focus on the physiological\\ncauses of behavior assert that psychological disorders like depression and schizophrenia are associated with\\nimbalances in one or more neurotransmitter systems. In this perspective, psychotropic medications can help\\nimprove the symptoms associated with these disorders. Psychotropic medications are drugs that treat\\npsychiatric symptoms by restoring neurotransmitter balance.\\nMajor Neurotransmitters and How They Affect Behavior\\nNeurotransmitter Involved in Potential Effect on Behavior\\nAcetylcholine Muscle action, memory Increased arousal, enhanced cognition\\nBeta-endorphin Pain, pleasure Decreased anxiety, decreased tension\\nDopamine Mood, sleep, learning Increased pleasure, suppressed appetite\\nGamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) Brain function, sleep Decreased anxiety, decreased tension\\nGlutamate Memory, learning Increased learning, enhanced memory\\nNorepinephrine Heart, intestines, alertness Increased arousal, suppressed appetite\\nSerotonin Mood, sleep Modulated mood, suppressed appetite\\nTABLE 3.1\\nPsychoactive drugs can act as agonists or antagonists for a given neurotransmitter system. Agonists are\\nchemicals that mimic a neurotransmitter at the receptor site. An antagonist, on the other hand, blocks or\\nimpedes the normal activity of a neurotransmitter at the receptor. Agonists and antagonists represent drugs\\nthat are prescribed to correct the specific neurotransmitter imbalances underlying a person’s condition. For\\nexample, Parkinson's disease, a progressive nervous system disorder, is associated with low levels of\\ndopamine. Therefore, a common treatment strategy for Parkinson's disease involves using dopamine agonists,\\nwhich mimic the effects of dopamine by binding to dopamine receptors.\\nCertain symptoms of schizophrenia are associated with overactive dopamine neurotransmission. The\\nantipsychotics used to treat these symptoms are antagonists for dopamine—they block dopamine’s effects by\\nbinding its receptors without activating them. Thus, they prevent dopamine released by one neuron from\\nsignaling information to adjacent neurons.\\nIn contrast to agonists and antagonists, which both operate by binding to receptor sites, reuptake inhibitors\\nprevent unused neurotransmitters from being transported back to the neuron. This allows neurotransmitters\\nto remain active in the synaptic cleft for longer durations, increasing their effectiveness. Depression, which\\nhas been consistently linked with reduced serotonin levels, is commonly treated with selective serotonin\\nreuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). By preventing reuptake, SSRIs strengthen the effect of serotonin, giving it more\\ntime to interact with serotonin receptors on dendrites. Common SSRIs on the market today include Prozac,\\nPaxil, and Zoloft. The drug LSD is structurally very similar to serotonin, and it affects the same neurons and\\nreceptors as serotonin. Psychotropic drugs are not instant solutions for people suffering from psychological\\ndisorders. Often, an individual must take a drug for several weeks before seeing improvement, and many\\n3.2 • Cells of the Nervous System 83\\npsychoactive drugs have significant negative side effects. Furthermore, individuals vary dramatically in how\\nthey respond to the drugs. To improve chances for success, it is not uncommon for people receiving\\npharmacotherapy to undergo psychological and/or behavioral therapies as well. Some research suggests that\\ncombining drug therapy with other forms of therapy tends to be more effective than any one treatment alone\\n(for one such example, see March et al., 2007).\\n3.3 Parts of the Nervous System\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Describe the difference between the central and peripheral nervous systems\\n• Explain the difference between the somatic and autonomic nervous systems\\n• Differentiate between the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system\\nThe nervous system can be divided into two major subdivisions: the central nervous system (CNS) and the\\nperipheral nervous system (PNS), shown in Figure 3.13. The CNS is comprised of the brain and spinal cord;\\nthe PNS connects the CNS to the rest of the body. In this section, we focus on the peripheral nervous system;\\nlater, we look at the brain and spinal cord.\\nFIGURE 3.13 The nervous system is divided into two major parts: (a) the Central Nervous System and (b) the\\nPeripheral Nervous System.\\nPeripheral Nervous System\\nThe peripheral nervous system is made up of thick bundles of axons, called nerves, carrying messages back\\nand forth between the CNS and the muscles, organs, and senses in the periphery of the body (i.e., everything\\noutside the CNS). The PNS has two major subdivisions: the somatic nervous system and the autonomic\\n84 3 • Biopsychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nnervous system.\\nThe somatic nervous system is associated with activities traditionally thought of as conscious or voluntary. It\\nis involved in the relay of sensory and motor information to and from the CNS; therefore, it consists of motor\\nneurons and sensory neurons. Motor neurons, carrying instructions from the CNS to the muscles, are efferent\\nfibers (efferent means “moving away from”). Sensory neurons, carrying sensory information to the CNS, are\\nafferent fibers (afferent means “moving toward”). A helpful way to remember this is that efferent = exit and\\nafferent = arrive. Each nerve is basically a bundle of neurons forming a two-way superhighway, containing\\nthousands of axons, both efferent and afferent.\\nThe autonomic nervous system controls our internal organs and glands and is generally considered to be\\noutside the realm of voluntary control. It can be further subdivided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic\\ndivisions (Figure 3.14). The sympathetic nervous system is involved in preparing the body for stress-related\\nactivities; the parasympathetic nervous system is associated with returning the body to routine, day-to-day\\noperations. The two systems have complementary functions, operating in tandem to maintain the body’s\\nhomeostasis. Homeostasis is a state of equilibrium, or balance, in which biological conditions (such as body\\ntemperature) are maintained at optimal levels.\\nFIGURE 3.14 The sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system have the opposite\\neffects on various systems.\\nThe sympathetic nervous system is activated when we are faced with stressful or high-arousal situations. The\\nactivity of this system was adaptive for our ancestors, increasing their chances of survival. Imagine, for\\nexample, that one of our early ancestors, out hunting small game, suddenly disturbs a large bear with her cubs.\\nAt that moment, the hunter's body undergoes a series of changes—a direct function of sympathetic\\nactivation—preparing them to face the threat. The pupils dilate, the heart rate and blood pressure increase, the\\nbladder relaxes, and the liver releases glucose; adrenaline surges into the bloodstream.

Different versions of a gene are called\\nalleles—sometimes alleles can be classified as dominant or recessive. A dominant allele always results in the\\ndominant phenotype. In order to exhibit a recessive phenotype, an individual must be homozygous for the\\nrecessive allele. Genes affect both physical and psychological characteristics. Ultimately, how and when a gene\\nis expressed, and what the outcome will be—in terms of both physical and psychological characteristics—is a\\nfunction of the interaction between our genes and our environments.\\n3.2 Cells of the Nervous System\\nGlia and neurons are the two cell types that make up the nervous system. While glia generally play supporting\\nroles, the communication between neurons is fundamental to all of the functions associated with the nervous\\nsystem. Neuronal communication is made possible by the neuron’s specialized structures. The soma contains\\nthe cell nucleus, and the dendrites extend from the soma in tree-like branches. The axon is another major\\nextension of the cell body; axons are often covered by a myelin sheath, which increases the speed of\\ntransmission of neural impulses. At the end of the axon are terminal buttons that contain synaptic vesicles\\nfilled with neurotransmitters.\\nNeuronal communication is an electrochemical event. The dendrites contain receptors for neurotransmitters\\nreleased by nearby neurons. If the signals received from other neurons are sufficiently strong, an action\\npotential will travel down the length of the axon to the terminal buttons, resulting in the release of\\nneurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. Action potentials operate on the all-or-none principle and involve\\n102 3 • Summary\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nthe movement of Na+ and K+ across the neuronal membrane.\\nDifferent neurotransmitters are associated with different functions. Often, psychological disorders involve\\nimbalances in a given neurotransmitter system. Therefore, psychotropic drugs are prescribed in an attempt to\\nbring the neurotransmitters back into balance. Drugs can act either as agonists or as antagonists for a given\\nneurotransmitter system.\\n3.3 Parts of the Nervous System\\nThe brain and spinal cord make up the central nervous system. The peripheral nervous system is comprised of\\nthe somatic and autonomic nervous systems. The somatic nervous system transmits sensory and motor\\nsignals to and from the central nervous system. The autonomic nervous system controls the function of our\\norgans and glands, and can be divided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions. Sympathetic\\nactivation prepares us for fight or flight, while parasympathetic activation is associated with normal\\nfunctioning under relaxed conditions.\\n3.4 The Brain and Spinal Cord\\nThe brain consists of two hemispheres, each controlling the opposite side of the body. Each hemisphere can be\\nsubdivided into different lobes: frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital. In addition to the lobes of the\\ncerebral cortex, the forebrain includes the thalamus (sensory relay) and limbic system (emotion and memory\\ncircuit). The midbrain contains the reticular formation, which is important for sleep and arousal, as well as the\\nsubstantia nigra and ventral tegmental area. These structures are important for movement, reward, and\\naddictive processes. The hindbrain contains the structures of the brainstem (medulla, pons, and midbrain),\\nwhich control automatic functions like breathing and blood pressure. The hindbrain also contains the\\ncerebellum, which helps coordinate movement and certain types of memories.\\nIndividuals with brain damage have been studied extensively to provide information about the role of different\\nareas of the brain, and recent advances in technology allow us to glean similar information by imaging brain\\nstructure and function.

LINK T O LEARNING Watch this video about the epigenetics of twin studies (http://openstax.org/l/twinstudy) to learn more. Genes affect more than our physical characteristics. Indeed, scientists have found genetic linkages to a number of behavioral characteristics, ranging from basic personality traits to sexual orientation to spirituality (for examples, see Mustanski et al., 2005; Comings, Gonzales, Saucier, Johnson, & MacMurray, 2000). Genes are also associated with temperament and a number of psychological disorders, such as depression and schizophrenia. So while it is true that genes provide the biological blueprints for our cells, tissues, organs, and body, they also have a significant impact on our experiences and our behaviors. Let’s look at the following findings regarding schizophrenia in light of our three views of gene-environment interactions. Which view do you think best explains this evidence? In a 2004 study by Tienari and colleagues, adoptees whose biological mothers had schizophrenia and who had been raised in a disturbed family environment were much more likely to develop schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder than were any of the other groups in the study: • Of adoptees whose biological mothers had schizophrenia (high genetic risk) and who were raised in disturbed family environments, 36.8% were likely to develop schizophrenia. • Of adoptees whose biological mothers had schizophrenia (high genetic risk) and who were raised in healthy family environments, 5.8% were likely to develop schizophrenia. • Of adoptees with a low genetic risk (whose mothers did not have schizophrenia) and who were raised in disturbed family environments, 5.3% were likely to develop schizophrenia. • Of adoptees with a low genetic risk (whose mothers did not have schizophrenia) and who were raised in healthy family environments, 4.8% were likely to develop schizophrenia. The study shows that adoptees with high genetic risk were most likely to develop schizophrenia if they were raised in disturbed home environments. This is consistent with our view that the environment plays a major role in determining whether or not an individual will develop a psychological disorder. In contrast, the study suggests that if an adoptee’s biological mother had no schizophrenia, she would not be at risk for developing a psychotic disorder, even if she had raised her adoptive child in an environment of high genetic risk. In another study, researchers found that children of mothers with schizophrenia had a significantly higher risk of developing schizophrenia than did children whose mothers were not schizophrenic. They also found that the risk of schizophrenia was significantly greater for boys than for girls. These findings are consistent with our views on the role of genetics in schizophrenia. For example, we know that schizophrenia is more common in males than in females and that boys are at greater risk than girls for developing the disorder. However, these findings do not necessarily mean that genetics is the only factor that determines whether or not a child develops a mental illness. There are many other factors that may play a role, including environmental factors and biological factors, as well as both genetic and non-genetic factors. Therefore, it is important to consider all of these factors when trying to understand why some children develop mental illnesses and others don’t. Another example of how genetics and environment interact can be found in studies of twins. Researchers found that identical twins raised together were less likely than fraternal (non-identical) twins to become twin sisters or brothers. However, when the twins were separated at birth and raised apart, there was no significant difference in their likelihood of becoming twin sisters and brothers. These findings suggest that genetic factors are important, but they are not the whole story. It is also important to recognize that environmental factors can play an important role in shaping a person’s characteristics and behaviors, just as they do in other areas of life. Environmental factors include families, friends, schools, neighborhoods, etc. Just as genetics can influence our behavior, so too can our experiences and interactions with the world around us.', 'references': '{\"sections\": [\"Biopsychology/The Brain and Spinal Cord\", \"States of Consciousness/Sleep and Why We Sleep\"], \"pages\": [\"92\", \"95\", \"115\"]}'}\n",

He said, “The happiness of mankind lies in\\nworking together, in living as if each individual had set himself the task of contributing to the common welfare”\\n(Adler, 1964, p. 255) with the main goal of psychology being “to recognize the equal rights and equality of\\nothers” (Adler, 1961, p. 691).\\nWith these ideas, Adler identified three fundamental social tasks that all of us must experience: occupational\\ntasks (careers), societal tasks (friendship), and love tasks (finding an intimate partner for a long-term\\nrelationship). Rather than focus on sexual or aggressive motives for behavior as Freud did, Adler focused on\\nsocial motives. He also emphasized conscious rather than unconscious motivation, since he believed that the\\nthree fundamental social tasks are explicitly known and pursued. That is not to say that Adler did not also\\nbelieve in unconscious processes—he did—but he felt that conscious processes were more important.\\nOne of Adler’s major contributions to personality psychology was the idea that our birth order shapes our\\npersonality. He proposed that older siblings, who start out as the focus of their parents’ attention but must\\nshare that attention once a new child joins the family, compensate by becoming overachievers. The youngest\\nchildren, according to Adler, may be spoiled, leaving the middle child with the opportunity to minimize the\\nnegative dynamics of the youngest and oldest children. Despite popular attention, research has not\\nconclusively confirmed Adler’s hypotheses about birth order.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nOne of Adler’s major contributions to personality psychology was the idea that our birth order shapes our\\npersonality.

It was Anna Freud\\nwho encouraged Erikson to study psychoanalysis. Erikson received his diploma from the Vienna\\nPsychoanalytic Institute in 1933, and as Nazism spread across Europe, he fled the country and immigrated to\\nthe United States that same year. As you learned when you studied lifespan development, Erikson later\\nproposed a psychosocial theory of development, suggesting that an individual’s personality develops\\nthroughout the lifespan—a departure from Freud’s view that personality is fixed in early life. In his theory,\\nErikson emphasized the social relationships that are important at each stage of personality development, in\\ncontrast to Freud’s emphasis on sex. Erikson identified eight stages, each of which represents a conflict or\\ndevelopmental task (Table 11.2). The development of a healthy personality and a sense of competence depend\\non the successful completion of each task.\\n11.3 • Neo-Freudians: Adler, Erikson, Jung, and Horney 369\\nErikson’s Psychosocial Stages of Development\\nStage Age\\n(years)\\nDevelopmental\\nTask Description\\n1 0–1 Trust vs. mistrust Trust (or mistrust) that basic needs, such as nourishment and affection,\\nwill be met\\n2 1–3 Autonomy vs.\\nshame/doubt Sense of independence in many tasks develops\\n3 3–6 Initiative vs. guilt Take initiative on some activities, may develop guilt when success not\\nmet or boundaries overstepped\\n4 7–11 Industry vs.\\ninferiority\\nDevelop self-confidence in abilities when competent or sense of\\ninferiority when not\\n5 12–18 Identity vs.\\nconfusion Experiment with and develop identity and roles\\n6 19–29 Intimacy vs.\\nisolation Establish intimacy and relationships with others\\n7 30–64 Generativity vs.\\nstagnation Contribute to society and be part of a family\\n8 65– Integrity vs.\\ndespair Assess and make sense of life and meaning of contributions\\nTABLE 11.2\\nCarl Jung\\nCarl Jung (Figure 11.9) was a Swiss psychiatrist and protégé of Freud, who later split off from Freud and\\ndeveloped his own theory, which he called analytical psychology. The focus of analytical psychology is on\\nworking to balance opposing forces of conscious and unconscious thought, and experience within one’s\\npersonality. According to Jung, this work is a continuous learning process—mainly occurring in the second half\\nof life—of becoming aware of unconscious elements and integrating them into consciousness.\\n370 11 • Personality\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nFIGURE 11.9 Carl Jung was interested in exploring the collective unconscious.\\nJung’s split from Freud was based on two major disagreements. First, Jung, like Adler and Erikson, did not\\naccept that sexual drive was the primary motivator in a person’s mental life. Second, although Jung agreed\\nwith Freud’s concept of a personal unconscious, he thought it to be incomplete. In addition to the personal\\nunconscious, Jung focused on the collective unconscious.\\nThe collective unconscious is a universal version of the personal unconscious, holding mental patterns, or\\nmemory traces, which are common to all of us (Jung, 1928). These ancestral memories, which Jung called\\narchetypes, are represented by universal themes in various cultures, as expressed through literature, art, and\\ndreams (Jung). Jung said that these themes reflect common experiences of people the world over, such as\\nfacing death, becoming independent, and striving for mastery. Jung (1964) believed that through biology, each\\nperson is handed down the same themes and that the same types of symbols—such as the hero, the maiden,\\nthe sage, and the trickster—are present in the folklore and fairy tales of every culture. In Jung’s view, the task of\\nintegrating these unconscious archetypal aspects of the self is part of the self-realization process in the second\\nhalf of life. With this orientation toward self-realization, Jung parted ways with Freud’s belief that personality is\\ndetermined solely by past events and anticipated the humanistic movement with its emphasis on self-\\nactualization and orientation toward the future.\\nJung also proposed two attitudes or approaches toward life: extroversion and introversion (Jung, 1923) (Table\\n11.3). These ideas are considered Jung’s most important contributions to the field of personality psychology,\\nas almost all models of personality now include these concepts. If you are an extrovert, then you are a person\\nwho is energized by being outgoing and socially oriented: You derive your energy from being around others. If\\nyou are an introvert, then you are a person who may be quiet and reserved, or you may be social, but your\\nenergy is derived from your inner psychic activity. Jung believed a balance between extroversion and\\nintroversion best served the goal of self-realization.\\nIntroverts and Extroverts\\nIntrovert Extrovert\\nEnergized by being alone Energized by being with others\\nTABLE 11.3\\n11.3 • Neo-Freudians: Adler, Erikson, Jung, and Horney 371\\nIntrovert Extrovert\\nAvoids attention Seeks attention\\nSpeaks slowly and softly Speaks quickly and loudly\\nThinks before speaking Thinks out loud\\nStays on one topic Jumps from topic to topic\\nPrefers written communication Prefers verbal communication\\nPays attention easily Distractible\\nCautious Acts first, thinks later\\nTABLE 11.3\\nAnother concept proposed by Jung was the persona, which he referred to as a mask that we adopt. According\\nto Jung, we consciously create this persona; however, it is derived from both our conscious experiences and\\nour collective unconscious. What is the purpose of the persona? Jung believed that it is a compromise between\\nwho we really are (our true self) and what society expects us to be. We hide those parts of ourselves that are not\\naligned with society’s expectations.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nJung’s view of extroverted and introverted types serves as a basis of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI).\\nThis questionnaire describes a person’s degree of introversion versus extroversion, thinking versus feeling,\\nintuition versus sensation, and judging versus perceiving. Take this modified questionnaire based on the MBTI\\n(http://openstax.org/l/myersbriggs) to learn more.\\nAre Archetypes Genetically Based?\\nJung proposed that human responses to archetypes are similar to instinctual responses in animals. One criticism of\\nJung is that there is no evidence that archetypes are biologically based or similar to animal instincts (Roesler, 2012).\\nJung formulated his ideas about 100 years ago, and great advances have been made in the field of genetics since\\nthat time. We’ve found that human babies are born with certain capacities, including the ability to acquire language.\\nHowever, we’ve also found that symbolic information (such as archetypes) is not encoded on the genome and that\\nbabies cannot decode symbolism, refuting the idea of a biological basis to archetypes. Rather than being seen as\\npurely biological, more recent research suggests that archetypes emerge directly from our experiences and are\\nreflections of linguistic or cultural characteristics (Young-Eisendrath, 1995). Today, most Jungian scholars believe\\nthat the collective unconscious and archetypes are based on both innate and environmental influences, with the\\ndifferences being in the role and degree of each (Sotirova-Kohli et al., 2013).\\nKaren Horney\\nKaren Horney was one of the first women trained as a Freudian psychoanalyst. During the Great Depression,\\nHorney moved from Germany to the United States, and subsequently moved away from Freud’s teachings. Like\\nJung, Horney believed that each individual has the potential for self-realization and that the goal of\\npsychoanalysis should be moving toward a healthy self rather than exploring early childhood patterns of\\nCONNECT THE CONCEPTS\\n372 11 • Personality\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\ndysfunction. Horney also disagreed with the Freudian idea that girls have penis envy and are jealous of male\\nbiological features. According to Horney, any jealousy is most likely culturally based, due to the greater\\nprivileges that men often have, meaning that the differences between men’s and women’s personalities are\\nculturally based, not biologically based. She further suggested that men have womb envy, because they cannot\\ngive birth.\\nHorney’s theories focused on the role of unconscious anxiety. She suggested that normal growth can be\\nblocked by basic anxiety stemming from needs not being met, such as childhood experiences of loneliness\\nand/or isolation. How do children learn to handle this anxiety? Horney suggested three styles of coping (Table\\n11.4). The first coping style, moving toward people, relies on affiliation and dependence. These children\\nbecome dependent on their parents and other caregivers in an effort to receive attention and affection, which\\nprovides relief from anxiety (Burger, 2008). When these children grow up, they tend to use this same coping\\nstrategy to deal with relationships, expressing an intense need for love and acceptance (Burger, 2008). The\\nsecond coping style, moving against people, relies on aggression and assertiveness. Children with this coping\\nstyle find that fighting is the best way to deal with an unhappy home situation, and they deal with their feelings\\nof insecurity by bullying other children (Burger, 2008). As adults, people with this coping style tend to lash out\\nwith hurtful comments and exploit others (Burger, 2008). The third coping style, moving away from people,\\ncenters on detachment and isolation. These children handle their anxiety by withdrawing from the world. They\\nneed privacy and tend to be self-sufficient. When these children are adults, they continue to avoid such things\\nas love and friendship, and they also tend to gravitate toward careers that require little interaction with others\\n(Burger, 2008).\\nHorney’s Coping Styles\\nCoping Style Description Example\\nMoving toward\\npeople\\nAffiliation and\\ndependence\\nChild seeking positive attention and affection from parent; adult needing\\nlove\\nMoving against\\npeople\\nAggression and\\nmanipulation\\nChild fighting or bullying other children; adult who is abrasive and\\nverbally hurtful, or who exploits others\\nMoving away\\nfrom people\\nDetachment and\\nisolation Child withdrawn from the world and isolated; adult loner\\nTABLE 11.4\\nHorney believed these three styles are ways in which people typically cope with day-to-day problems; however,\\nthe three coping styles can become neurotic strategies if they are used rigidly and compulsively, leading a\\nperson to become alienated from others.\\n11.4 Learning Approaches\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Describe the behaviorist perspective on personality\\n• Describe the cognitive perspective on personality\\n• Describe the social cognitive perspective on personality\\nIn contrast to the psychodynamic approaches of Freud and the neo-Freudians, which relate personality to\\ninner (and hidden) processes, the learning approaches focus only on observable behavior.

Then-Deputy Commissioner Grace Kim wrote a letter to Social Security\\nemployees explaining the reasons the program was ending and cited an increased workload and a backlog of\\ncases as reasons for ending the pilot program. This change in the telework policy came on the heels of a\\nnegotiation between the American Federal Government Employee Union and the Social Security\\nAdministration, a negotiation that had to be brokered by the Federal Services Impasse Panel (a third-party\\nfederal organization developed specifically to arbitrate in situations where negotiations between union\\nofficials and federal organizations break down and progress halts between the organization and the union\\nrepresentatives) (Wagner, 2019a).\\nThe May 2019 decision by the panel gave Social Security Agency managers the ability to limit or restrict\\ntelework for employees using their discretion to ensure that all tasks were being completed and wait times\\nwere normal. One of the biggest reasons cited for this was that the organization was able to provide evidence\\nthat after the implementation of a telework program, the average wait time for individuals temporarily\\nincreased, causing a backlog of work to be completed at a later date. Although the Social Security\\nAdministration pushed the official end date for all telework in the agency to March of 2020, the program was\\nofficially ended. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress requested a review of the telework policy\\nand raised questions about whether it should be revived to serve as a preventative measure for reducing and\\nslowing the spread of the virus (Wagner, 2019b). Could this allow employees to continue working while not\\ncoming to the workplace in order to help prevent the spread of illness? What were the benefits versus the costs\\nof implementing a telework policy again for employees as the spread of the virus continued? What did\\nprevious research show related to the positive and negative benefits to the organization and the employees\\nwith respect to telework?\\n13\\nIndustrial-Organizational\\nPsychology\\n13.1 What Is Industrial and Organizational Psychology?\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Understand the scope of study in the field of industrial and organizational psychology\\n• Describe the history of industrial and organizational psychology\\nIn 2019, people who worked in the United States spent an average of about 42–54 hours per week working\\n(Bureau of Labor Statistics—U.S. Department of Labor, 2019). Sleeping was the only other activity they spent\\nmore time on with an average of about 43–62 hours per week. The workday is a significant portion of workers’\\ntime and energy. It impacts their lives and their family’s lives in positive and negative physical and\\npsychological ways. Industrial and organizational (I-O) psychology is a branch of psychology that studies\\nhow human behavior and psychology affect work and how they are affected by work.\\nIndustrial and organizational psychologists work in four main contexts: academia, government, consulting\\nfirms, and business. Most I-O psychologists have a master’s or doctorate degree. The field of I-O psychology can\\nbe divided into three broad areas (Figure 13.2 and Figure 13.3): industrial, organizational, and human factors.\\nIndustrial psychology is concerned with describing job requirements and assessing individuals for their\\nability to meet those requirements. In addition, once employees are hired, industrial psychology studies and\\ndevelops ways to train, evaluate, and respond to those evaluations. As a consequence of its concern for\\ncandidate characteristics, industrial psychology must also consider issues of legality regarding discrimination\\nin hiring. Organizational psychology is a discipline interested in how the relationships among employees\\naffect those employees and the performance of a business. This includes studying worker satisfaction,\\nmotivation, and commitment. This field also studies management, leadership, and organizational culture, as\\nwell as how an organization’s structures, management and leadership styles, social norms, and role\\nexpectations affect individual behavior. As a result of its interest in worker wellbeing and relationships,\\norganizational psychology also considers the subjects of harassment, including sexual harassment, and\\nworkplace violence. Human factors psychology is the study of how workers interact with the tools of work and\\nhow to design those tools to optimize workers’ productivity, safety, and health. These studies can involve\\ninteractions as straightforward as the fit of a desk, chair, and computer to a human having to sit on the chair at\\nthe desk using the computer for several hours each day. They can also include the examination of how humans\\ninteract with complex displays and their ability to interpret them accurately and quickly. In Europe, this field is\\nreferred to as ergonomics.\\nFIGURE 13.2 (a) Industrial psychology focuses on hiring and maintaining employees.

(credit \"ball chair\": modification\\nof work by Chris Rosario; credit \"standing desk\": modification of work by \"juhansonin_Flickr\"/Flickr; credit \"cycle\\ndesk\": modification of work by \"Benny Wong_Flickr\"/Flickr)\\nOccupational health psychology (OHP) deals with the stress, diseases, and disorders that can affect employees\\nas a result of the workplace. As such, the field is informed by research from the medical, biological,\\npsychological, organizational, human factors, human resources, and industrial fields. Individuals in this field\\nseek to examine the ways in which the organization affects the quality of work life for an employee and the\\nresponses that employees have towards their organization or as a result of their organization’s influence on\\nthem. The responses for employees are not limited to the workplace as there may be some spillover into their\\npersonal lives outside of work, especially if there is not good work-life balance. The ultimate goal of an\\noccupational health psychologist is to improve the overall health and well-being of an individual, and, as a\\nresult, increase the overall health of the organization (Society for Occupational Health Psychology, 2020).\\nIn 2009, the field of humanitarian work psychology (HWP) was developed as the brainchild of a small group of\\nI-O psychologists who met at a conference. Realizing they had a shared set of goals involving helping those who\\nare underserved and underprivileged, the I-O psychologists formally formed the group in 2012 and have\\napproximately 300 members worldwide. Although this is a small number, the group continues to expand. The\\n13.1 • What Is Industrial and Organizational Psychology? 449\\ngroup seeks to help marginalized members of society, such as people with low-income, find work. In addition,\\nthey help to determine ways to deliver humanitarian aid during major catastrophes. The Humanitarian Work\\nPsychology group can also reach out to those in the local community who do not have the knowledge, skills,\\nand abilities (KSAs) to be able to find gainful employment that would enable them to not need to receive aid. In\\nboth cases, humanitarian work psychologists try to help the underserved individuals develop KSAs that they\\ncan use to improve their lives and their current situations. When ensuring these underserved individuals\\nreceive training or education, the focus is on skills that, once learned, will never be forgotten and can serve\\nindividuals throughout their lifetimes as they seek employment (APA, 2016).

The study examined a total of about 45,000 decisions made by 35 operators and\\n4 managers over a period of 60 days. Their study found that as the number of decisions made per day by the\\noperators climbed, that is, as their cognitive effort increased, the operators made more mistakes in falsely\\nidentifying incidents as real security breaches (when, in reality, they were not). Interestingly, the opposite\\nmistake of identifying real intrusions as false alarms did not increase with increased cognitive demand. This\\nappears to be good news for the bank, since false alarms are not as costly as incorrectly rejecting a genuine\\nthreat. These kinds of studies combine research on attention, perception, teamwork, and human–computer\\ninteractions in a field of considerable societal and business significance. This is exactly the context of the\\nevents that led to the massive data breach for Target in the fall of 2013. Indications are that security personnel\\nreceived signals of a security breach but did not interpret them correctly, thus allowing the breach to continue\\nfor two weeks until an outside agency, the FBI, informed the company (Riley, Elgin, Lawrence, & Matlack,\\n2014).\\n13.4 • Human Factors Psychology and Workplace Design 479\\nKey Terms\\nAmericans with Disabilities Act employers cannot discriminate against any individual based on a disability\\nbona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ) requirement of certain occupations for which denying an\\nindividual employment would otherwise violate the law, such as requirements concerning religion or sex\\nchecklist method used to reduce workplace accidents\\ndiversity training training employees about cultural differences with the goal of improving teamwork\\ndownsizing process in which an organization tries to achieve greater overall efficiency by reducing the\\nnumber of employees\\nHawthorne effect increase in performance of individuals who are noticed, watched, and paid attention to by\\nresearchers or supervisors\\nhuman factors psychology branch of psychology that studies how workers interact with the tools of work and\\nhow to design those tools to optimize workers’ productivity, safety, and health\\nimmutable characteristic traits that employers cannot use to discriminate in hiring, benefits, promotions, or\\ntermination; these traits are fundamental to one’s personal identity (e.g. skin color and hair texture)\\nindustrial and organizational (I-O) psychology field in psychology that applies scientific principles to the\\nstudy of work and the workplace\\nindustrial psychology branch of psychology that studies job characteristics, applicant characteristics, and\\nhow to match them; also studies employee training and performance appraisal\\njob analysis determining and listing tasks associated with a particular job\\njob satisfaction degree of pleasure that employees derive from their job\\norganizational culture values, visions, hierarchies, norms and interactions between its employees; how an\\norganization is run, how it operates, and how it makes decisions\\norganizational psychology branch of psychology that studies the interactions between people working in\\norganizations and the effects of those interactions on productivity\\nperformance appraisal evaluation of an employee’s success or lack of success at performing the duties of the\\njob\\nprocedural justice fairness by which means are used to achieve results in an organization\\nscientific management theory of management that analyzed and synthesized workflows with the main\\nobjective of improving economic efficiency, especially labor productivity\\nsexual harassment sexually-based behavior that is knowingly unwanted and has an adverse effect of a\\nperson’s employment status, interferes with a person’s job performance, or creates a hostile or\\nintimidating work environment\\ntelecommuting employees’ ability to set their own hours allowing them to work from home at different parts\\nof the day\\nTheory X assumes workers are inherently lazy and unproductive; managers must have control and use\\npunishments\\nTheory Y assumes workers are people who seek to work hard and productively; managers and workers can\\nfind creative solutions to problems; workers do not need to be controlled and punished\\ntransactional leadership style characteristic of leaders who focus on supervision and organizational goals\\nachieved through a system of rewards and punishments; maintenance of the organizational status quo\\ntransformational leadership style characteristic of leaders who are charismatic role models, inspirational,\\nintellectually stimulating, and individually considerate and who seek to change the organization\\nU.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) responsible for enforcing federal laws that make it\\nillegal to discriminate against a job applicant or an employee because of the person’s race, color, religion,\\nsex (including pregnancy), national origin, age (40 or older), disability, or genetic information\\nwork team group of people within an organization or company given a specific task to achieve together\\nwork–family balance occurs when people juggle the demands of work life with the demands of family life\\nworkplace violence violence or the threat of violence against workers; can occur inside or outside the\\nworkplace\\n480 13 • Key Terms\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nSummary\\n13.1 What Is Industrial and Organizational Psychology?\\nThe field of I-O psychology had its birth in industrial psychology and the use of psychological concepts to aid in\\npersonnel selection. However, with research such as the Hawthorne study, it was found that productivity was\\naffected more by human interaction and not physical factors; the field of industrial psychology expanded to\\ninclude organizational psychology. Both WWI and WWII had a strong influence on the development of an\\nexpansion of industrial psychology in the United States and elsewhere: The tasks the psychologists were\\nassigned led to development of tests and research in how the psychological concepts could assist industry and\\nother areas. This movement aided in expanding industrial psychology to include organizational psychology.\\n13.2 Industrial Psychology: Selecting and Evaluating Employees\\nIndustrial psychology studies the attributes of jobs, applicants of those jobs, and methods for assessing fit to a\\njob. These procedures include job analysis, applicant testing, and interviews. It also studies and puts into place\\nprocedures for the orientation of new employees and ongoing training of employees. The process of hiring\\nemployees can be vulnerable to bias, which is illegal, and industrial psychologists must develop methods for\\nadhering to the law in hiring. Performance appraisal systems are an active area of research and practice in\\nindustrial psychology.\\n13.3 Organizational Psychology: The Social Dimension of Work\\nOrganizational psychology is concerned with the effects of interactions among people in the workplace on the\\nemployees themselves and on organizational productivity. Job satisfaction and its determinants and outcomes\\nare a major focus of organizational psychology research and practice. Organizational psychologists have also\\nstudied the effects of management styles and leadership styles on productivity. In addition to the employees\\nand management, organizational psychology also looks at the organizational culture and how that might affect\\nproductivity. One aspect of organization culture is the prevention and addressing of sexual and other forms of\\nharassment in the workplace. Sexual harassment includes language, behavior, or displays that create a hostile\\nenvironment; it also includes sexual favors requested in exchange for workplace rewards (i.e., quid pro quo).\\nIndustrial-organizational psychology has conducted extensive research on the triggers and causes of\\nworkplace violence and safety. This enables the organization to establish procedures that can identify these\\ntriggers before they become a problem.\\n13.4 Human Factors Psychology and Workplace Design\\nHuman factors psychology, or ergonomics, studies the interface between workers and their machines and\\nphysical environments. Human factors psychologists specifically seek to design machines to better support\\nthe workers using them. Psychologists may be involved in design of work tools such as software, displays, or\\nmachines from the beginning of the design process or during the testing an already developed product.\\nHuman factor psychologists are also involved in the development of best design recommendations and\\nregulations. One important aspect of human factors psychology is enhancing worker safety. Human factors\\nresearch involves efforts to understand and improve interactions between technology systems and their\\nhuman operators. Human–software interactions are a large sector of this research.\\nReview Questions\\n1. Who was the first psychologist to use psychology in advertising?\\na. Hugo Münsterberg\\nb. Elton Mayo\\nc.

Adler also believed in the importance of social connections, seeing childhood development emerging through social development rather than the sexual stages Freud outlined. Adler noted the inter-relatedness of humanity and the need to work together for the betterment of all. He said, “The happiness of mankind lies in working together, in living as if each individual had set himself the task of contributing to the common welfare” (Adler, 1964, p. 255) with the main goal of psychology being “to recognize the equal rights and equality of others” (Adler, 1961, p. 691). With these ideas, Adler identified three fundamental social tasks that all of us must experience: occupational tasks (careers), societal tasks (friendship), and love tasks (finding an intimate partner for a long-term relationship). Rather than focus on sexual or aggressive motives for behavior as Freud did, Adler focused on social motives. He also emphasized conscious rather than unconscious motivation, since he believed that the three fundamental social tasks are explicitly known and pursued. That is not to say that Adler did not also believe in unconscious processes—he did—but he felt that conscious processes were more important. One of Adler’s major contributions to personality psychology was the idea that our birth order shapes our personality. He proposed that older siblings, who start out as the focus of their parents’ attention but must share that attention once a new child joins the family, compensate by becoming overachievers. The youngest children, according to Adler, may be spoiled, leaving the middle child with the opportunity to minimize the negative dynamics of the youngest and oldest children. Despite popular attention, research has not conclusively confirmed Adler’s hypotheses about birth order.

Erik Erikson As an art school dropout with an uncertain future, young Erik Erikson met Freud’s daughter, Anna Freud, while he was tutoring the children of an old woman in a psychiatric hospital. Freud and his wife, Sigmund Freud, encouraged Erik to pursue a career in psychiatry. Erik’s mother, however, strongly opposed him from entering the profession, and he was forced to drop out of medical school at the age of 30. In the years that followed, Erik worked as a social worker in New York City and as an assistant professor at Columbia University’s School of Social Work. During this time, he became interested in psychoanalysis and began studying the work of Carl Jung, the Swiss psychiatrist who developed the analytical method of psychoanalytic psychotherapy. Jung’s ideas about the unconscious mind, which he called the “shadow” or “repressed memory,” had a profound impact on Erik. His interest in Jung led him to become a Jungian analyst and to write his first book on the subject, The Unconscious: An Interpretation of Dreams and Other Psychological Dreams (1892). In this book, Jung argued that dreams are a reflection of our unconscious thoughts and feelings. According to his theory, we are born with a set of unconscious desires and needs that we must work through in order to grow and develop into the person we want to be. This process of growth and development is referred to as “transcendence,” and it is this process that Erik wanted to study in his work with young adolescents. Link to Learning The following video provides a brief overview of Erik's life and work. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2008781014) Erich Eriksson was born in Stockholm, Sweden, on January 9,1795. As a child, his family was poor, but his father was a successful businessman who encouraged his children to follow their interests and pursue their own dreams. When Erik was eight years old, they moved to a small town in southern Sweden where he attended a private school. There he began to develop a love for art and music. By the time he graduated from high school, he had already been accepted into a boarding school for young boys. While there he developed a passion for psychiatry and became a member of a group of young men who were studying under the tutelage of Dr. Carl Hippocrates, a famous Greek physician. Hippocrates was known for his studies of human anatomy and was considered the father of modern medicine\", 'references': '{\"sections\": [\"Stress, Lifestyle, and Health/What Is Stress?\", \"Industrial-Organizational Psychology/Industrial Psychology: Selecting and Evaluating Employees\", \"Personality/Trait Theorists\"], \"pages\": [\"493\", \"460\", \"383\"]}'}\n",
      "Response for query ID 43: {'context': 'equally likely to give dispositional and external explanations. This supports the idea that actors tend to provide\\nfew internal explanations but many situational explanations for their own behavior. In contrast, observers tend\\nto provide more dispositional explanations for a friend’s behavior (Figure 12.5).\\nFIGURE 12.5 Actor-observer bias is evident when subjects explain their own reasons for liking a girlfriend versus\\ntheir impressions of others’ reasons for liking a girlfriend.\\nSelf-Serving Bias\\nWe can understand self-serving bias by digging more deeply into attribution, a belief about the cause of a\\nresult. One model of attribution proposes three main dimensions: locus of control (internal versus external),\\nstability (stable versus unstable), and controllability (controllable versus uncontrollable). In this context,\\nstability refers to the extent in which the circumstances that result in a given outcome are changeable. The\\ncircumstances are considered stable if they are unlikely to change. Controllability refers to the extent to which\\nthe circumstances that are associated with a given outcome can be controlled. Obviously, those things that we\\nhave the power to control would be labeled controllable (Weiner, 1979).\\nFollowing an outcome, self-serving biases are those attributions that enable us to see ourselves in a favorable\\nlight (for example, making internal attributions for success and external attributions for failures). When you do\\nwell at a task, for example acing an exam, it is in your best interest to make a dispositional attribution for your\\nbehavior (“I’m smart,”) instead of a situational one (“The exam was easy,”). Self-serving bias is the tendency to\\nexplain our successes as due to dispositional (internal) characteristics, but to explain our failures as due to\\nsituational (external) factors. Again, this is culture dependent. This bias serves to protect self-esteem. You can\\nimagine that if people always made situational attributions for their behavior, they would never be able to take\\ncredit and feel good about their accomplishments.\\nConsider the example of how we explain our favorite sports team’s wins. Research shows that we make\\ninternal, stable, and controllable attributions for our team’s victory (Figure 12.6) (Grove, Hanrahan, &\\nMcInman, 1991). For example, we might tell ourselves that our team is talented (internal), consistently works\\nhard (stable), and uses effective strategies (controllable). In contrast, we are more likely to make external,\\nunstable, and uncontrollable attributions when our favorite team loses. For example, we might tell ourselves\\nthat the other team has more experienced players or that the referees were unfair (external), the other team\\nplayed at home (unstable), and the cold weather affected our team’s performance (uncontrollable).\\n404 12 • Social Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nFIGURE 12.6 We tend to believe that our team wins because it’s better, but loses for reasons it cannot control\\n(Roesch & Amirkham, 1997). (credit: \"TheAHL\"/Flickr)\\nJust-World Hypothesis\\nOne consequence of westerners’ tendency to provide dispositional explanations for behavior is victim blame\\n(Jost & Major, 2001). When people experience bad fortune, others tend to assume that they somehow are\\nresponsible for their own fate. A common ideology, or worldview, in the United States is the just-world\\nhypothesis. The just-world hypothesis is the belief that people get the outcomes they deserve (Lerner & Miller,\\n1978). In order to maintain the belief that the world is a fair place, people tend to think that good people\\nexperience positive outcomes, and bad people experience negative outcomes (Jost, Banaji, & Nosek, 2004; Jost\\n& Major, 2001). The ability to think of the world as a fair place, where people get what they deserve, allows us to\\nfeel that the world is predictable and that we have some control over our life outcomes (Jost et al., 2004; Jost &\\nMajor, 2001). For example, if you want to experience positive outcomes, you just need to work hard to get\\nahead in life.\\nCan you think of a negative consequence of the just-world hypothesis? One negative consequence is people’s\\ntendency to blame poor individuals for their plight. What common explanations are given for why people live\\nin poverty? Have you heard statements such as, “The poor are lazy and just don’t want to work” or “Poor\\npeople just want to live off the government”? What types of explanations are these, dispositional or situational?\\nThese dispositional explanations are clear examples of the fundamental attribution error. Blaming poor people\\nfor their poverty ignores situational factors that impact them, such as high unemployment rates, recession,\\npoor educational opportunities, and the familial cycle of poverty (Figure 12.7). Other research shows that\\npeople who hold just-world beliefs have negative attitudes toward people who are unemployed and people\\nliving with AIDS (Sutton & Douglas, 2005). In the United States and other countries, victims of sexual assault\\nmay find themselves blamed for their abuse. Victim advocacy groups, such as Domestic Violence Ended\\n(DOVE), attend court in support of victims to ensure that blame is directed at the perpetrators of sexual\\nviolence, not the victims.\\nFIGURE 12.7 People who hold just-world beliefs tend to blame the people in poverty for their circumstances,\\nignoring situational and cultural causes of poverty.

We have discussed situational perspectives and social psychology’s emphasis on the ways in which\\na person’s environment, including culture and other social influences, affect behavior. In this section, we\\nexamine situational forces that have a strong influence on human behavior including social roles, social\\nnorms, and scripts. We discuss how humans use the social environment as a source of information, or cues, on\\nhow to behave. Situational influences on our behavior have important consequences, such as whether we will\\nhelp a stranger in an emergency or how we would behave in an unfamiliar environment.\\nSocial Roles\\nOne major social determinant of human behavior is our social roles. A social role is a pattern of behavior that\\nis expected of a person in a given setting or group (Hare, 2003). Each one of us has several social roles. You\\nmay be, at the same time, a student, a parent, an aspiring teacher, a son or daughter, a spouse, and a lifeguard.\\nHow do these social roles influence your behavior? Social roles are defined by culturally shared knowledge.\\nThat is, nearly everyone in a given culture knows what behavior is expected of a person in a given role. For\\nexample, what is the social role for a student? If you look around a college classroom you will likely see\\nstudents engaging in studious behavior, taking notes, listening to the professor, reading the textbook, and\\nsitting quietly at their desks (Figure 12.8). Of course you may see students deviating from the expected\\nstudious behavior such as texting on their phones or using Facebook on their laptops, but in all cases, the\\nstudents that you observe are attending class—a part of the social role of students.\\nFIGURE 12.8 Being a student is just one of the many social roles you have. (credit: modification of work by “Rural\\nInstitute”/Flickr)\\nSocial roles, and our related behavior, can vary across different settings. How do you behave when you are\\nengaging in the role of a child attending a family function? Now imagine how you behave when you are\\nengaged in the role of employee at your workplace. It is very likely that your behavior will be different. Perhaps\\nyou are more relaxed and outgoing with your family, making jokes and doing silly things. But at your workplace\\nyou might speak more professionally, and although you may be friendly, you are also serious and focused on\\ngetting the work completed. These are examples of how our social roles influence and often dictate our\\nbehavior to the extent that identity and personality can vary with context (that is, in different social groups)\\n(Malloy, Albright, Kenny, Agatstein & Winquist, 1997).\\n406 12 • Social Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nSocial Norms\\nAs discussed previously, social roles are defined by a culture’s shared knowledge of what is expected behavior\\nof an individual in a specific role. This shared knowledge comes from social norms. A social norm is a group’s\\nexpectation of what is appropriate and acceptable behavior for its members—how they are supposed to behave\\nand think (Deutsch & Gerard, 1955; Berkowitz, 2004). How are we expected to act? What are we expected to\\ntalk about? What are we expected to wear? In our discussion of social roles we noted that colleges have social\\nnorms for students’ behavior in the role of student and workplaces have social norms for employees’ behaviors\\nin the role of employee. Social norms are everywhere including in families, gangs, and on social media outlets.\\nWhat are some social norms on Instagram?\\nTweens, Teens, and Social Norms\\nMy 11-year-old daughter, Janelle, recently told me she needed shorts and shirts for the summer, and that she\\nwanted me to take her to a store at the mall that is popular with preteens and teens to buy them. I have noticed that\\nmany girls have clothes from that store, so I tried teasing her. I said, “All the shirts say ‘Aero’ on the front. If you are\\nwearing a shirt like that and you have a substitute teacher, and the other girls are all wearing that type of shirt, won’t\\nthe substitute teacher think you are all named ‘Aero’?”\\nMy daughter replied, in typical 11-year-old fashion, “Mom, you are not funny. Can we please go shopping?”\\nI tried a different tactic. I asked Janelle if having clothing from that particular store will make her popular. She\\nreplied, “No, it will not make me popular. It is what the popular kids wear. It will make me feel happier.” How can a\\nlabel or name brand make someone feel happier? Think back to what you’ve learned about lifespan development.\\nWhat is it about pre-teens and young teens that make them want to fit in (Figure 12.9)? Does this change over time?\\nThink back to your high school experience, or look around your college campus. What is the main name brand\\nclothing you see? What messages do we get from the media about how to fit in?\\nFIGURE 12.9 Young people struggle to become independent at the same time they are desperately trying to fit in\\nwith their peers. (credit: Monica Arellano-Ongpin)\\nScripts\\nBecause of social roles, people tend to know what behavior is expected of them in specific, familiar settings. A\\nscript is a person’s knowledge about the sequence of events expected in a specific setting (Schank & Abelson,\\n1977). How do you act on the first day of school, when you walk into an elevator, or are at a restaurant? For\\nexample, at a restaurant in the United States, if we want the server’s attention, we try to make eye contact. In\\nBrazil, you would make the sound “psst” to get the server’s attention. You can see the cultural differences in\\nscripts. To an American, saying “psst” to a server might seem rude, yet to a Brazilian, trying to make eye\\ncontact might not seem an effective strategy. Scripts are important sources of information to guide behavior in\\ngiven situations. Can you imagine being in an unfamiliar situation and not having a script for how to behave?\\nThis could be uncomfortable and confusing. How could you find out about social norms in an unfamiliar\\nCONNECT THE CONCEPTS\\n12.2 • Self-presentation 407\\nculture?\\nZimbardo’s Stanford Prison Experiment\\nThe famous Stanford prison experiment, conducted by social psychologist Philip Zimbardo and his\\ncolleagues at Stanford University, demonstrated the power of social roles, social norms, and scripts. In the\\nsummer of 1971, an advertisement was placed in a California newspaper asking for male volunteers to\\nparticipate in a study about the psychological effects of prison life. More than 70 men volunteered, and these\\nvolunteers then underwent psychological testing to eliminate candidates who had underlying psychiatric\\nissues, medical issues, or a history of crime or drug abuse. The pool of volunteers was whittled down to 24\\nhealthy male college students. Each student was paid $15 per day (equivalent to about $80 today) and was\\nrandomly assigned to play the role of either a prisoner or a guard in the study. Based on what you have learned\\nabout research methods, why is it important that participants were randomly assigned?\\nA mock prison was constructed in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford. Participants assigned\\nto play the role of prisoners were “arrested” at their homes by Palo Alto police officers, booked at a police\\nstation, and subsequently taken to the mock prison. The experiment was scheduled to run for several weeks.\\nTo the surprise of the researchers, both the “prisoners” and “guards” assumed their roles with zeal. On the\\nsecond day of the experiment, the guards forced the prisoners to strip, took their beds, and isolated the\\nringleaders using solitary confinement. In a relatively short time, the guards came to harass the prisoners in\\nan increasingly sadistic manner, through a complete lack of privacy, lack of basic comforts such as mattresses\\nto sleep on, and through degrading chores and late-night counts.\\nThe prisoners, in turn, began to show signs of severe anxiety and hopelessness—they began tolerating the\\nguards’ abuse. Even the Stanford professor who designed the study and was the head researcher, Philip\\nZimbardo, found himself acting as if the prison was real and his role, as prison supervisor, was real as well.\\nAfter only six days, the experiment had to be ended due to the participants’ deteriorating behavior. Zimbardo\\nexplained,\\nAt this point it became clear that we had to end the study. We had created an overwhelmingly powerful\\nsituation—a situation in which prisoners were withdrawing and behaving in pathological ways, and in\\nwhich some of the guards were behaving sadistically. Even the “good” guards felt helpless to\\nintervene, and none of the guards quit while the study was in progress. Indeed, it should be noted that\\nno guard ever came late for his shift, called in sick, left early, or demanded extra pay for overtime\\nwork. (Zimbardo, 2013)\\nThe Stanford Prison Experiment has been used as a memorable demonstration of the incredible power that\\nsocial roles, norms, and scripts have in affecting human behavior. However, multiple aspects of the study have\\nbeen subject to criticism since its inception. The nature of these criticisms range from ethical concerns to\\nissues of generalizability (Bartels, Milovich, & Moussier, 2016; Griggs, 2014; Le Texier, 2019). One criticism is\\nthat the way students were recruited for the experiment may have impacted the outcome (Carnahan &\\nMcFarland, 2007). Another criticism questions the conclusions that can be drawn from the study. Zimbardo\\nappears to have provided specific guidelines of the types of behaviors that were expected of the guards\\n(Zimbardo, 2007). Subsequent research suggests that such guidelines likely created an expectation of the\\ntypes of behavior that Zimbardo reported observing in the Stanford Prison Experiment (Bartels, 2019), and\\nthat given these expectations, the guards simply acted as they thought they were expected to act. It has also\\nbeen problematic that attempts to replicate aspects of the study have not been successful. For example, when\\nno guidelines were presented to the guards, researchers documented different outcomes than those observed\\nby Zimbardo. (Reicher & Haslam, 2006).\\nThe Stanford Prison Experiment has some parallels with the abuse of prisoners of war by U.S. Army troops and\\nCIA personnel at the Abu Ghraib prison in 2003 and 2004 during the Iraq War. The offenses at Abu Ghraib were\\ndocumented by photographs of the abuse, some taken by the abusers themselves (Figure 12.10).\\n408 12 • Social Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nFIGURE 12.10 Iraqi prisoners of war were abused by their American captors in Abu Ghraib prison, during the\\nsecond Iraq war.

Now we\\nturn to how the power of the situation can influence our attitudes and beliefs. Attitude is our evaluation of a\\nperson, an idea, or an object. We have attitudes for many things ranging from products that we might pick up\\nin the supermarket to people around the world to political policies. Typically, attitudes are favorable or\\nunfavorable: positive or negative (Eagly & Chaiken, 1993). And, they have three components: an affective\\ncomponent (feelings), a behavioral component (the effect of the attitude on behavior), and a cognitive\\ncomponent (belief and knowledge) (Rosenberg & Hovland, 1960).\\nFor example, you may hold a positive attitude toward recycling. This attitude should result in positive feelings\\ntoward recycling (such as “It makes me feel good to recycle” or “I enjoy knowing that I make a small difference\\nin reducing the amount of waste that ends up in landfills”). Certainly, this attitude should be reflected in our\\nbehavior: You actually recycle as often as you can. Finally, this attitude will be reflected in favorable thoughts\\n(for example, “Recycling is good for the environment” or “Recycling is the responsible thing to do”).\\nOur attitudes and beliefs are not only influenced by external forces, but also by internal influences that we\\ncontrol. Like our behavior, our attitudes and thoughts are not always changed by situational pressures, but they\\ncan be consciously changed by our own free will. In this section we discuss the conditions under which we\\nwould want to change our own attitudes and beliefs.\\nWhat is Cognitive Dissonance?\\nSocial psychologists have documented that feeling good about ourselves and maintaining positive self-esteem\\nis a powerful motivator of human behavior (Tavris & Aronson, 2008). In the United States, members of the\\npredominant culture typically think very highly of themselves and view themselves as good people who are\\nabove average on many desirable traits (Ehrlinger, Gilovich, & Ross, 2005). Often, our behavior, attitudes, and\\n12.3 • Attitudes and Persuasion 409\\nSummary\\n12.1 What Is Social Psychology?\\nSocial psychology is the subfield of psychology that studies the power of the situation to influence individuals’\\nthoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Psychologists categorize the causes of human behavior as those due to\\ninternal factors, such as personality, or those due to external factors, such as cultural and other social\\ninfluences. Behavior is better explained, however, by using both approaches. Lay people tend to over-rely on\\ndispositional explanations for behavior and ignore the power of situational influences, a perspective called the\\nfundamental attribution error. People from individualistic cultures are more likely to display this bias versus\\npeople from collectivistic cultures. Our explanations for our own and others behaviors can be biased due to not\\nhaving enough information about others’ motivations for behaviors and by providing explanations that bolster\\nour self-esteem.\\n12.2 Self-presentation\\nHuman behavior is largely influenced by our social roles, norms, and scripts. In order to know how to act in a\\ngiven situation, we have shared cultural knowledge of how to behave depending on our role in society. Social\\nnorms dictate the behavior that is appropriate or inappropriate for each role. Each social role has scripts that\\nhelp humans learn the sequence of appropriate behaviors in a given setting. The famous Stanford prison\\nexperiment is an example of how the power of the situation can dictate the social roles, norms, and scripts we\\nfollow in a given situation, even if this behavior is contrary to our typical behavior.\\n12.3 Attitudes and Persuasion\\nAttitudes are our evaluations or feelings toward a person, idea, or object and typically are positive or negative.\\nOur attitudes and beliefs are influenced not only by external forces, but also by internal influences that we\\ncontrol. An internal form of attitude change is cognitive dissonance or the tension we experience when our\\nthoughts, feelings, and behaviors are in conflict. In order to reduce dissonance, individuals can change their\\nbehavior, attitudes, or cognitions, or add a new cognition. External forces of persuasion include advertising;\\nthe features of advertising that influence our behaviors include the source, message, and audience. There are\\ntwo primary routes to persuasion. The central route to persuasion uses facts and information to persuade\\npotential consumers. The peripheral route uses positive association with cues such as beauty, fame, and\\npositive emotions.\\n12.4 Conformity, Compliance, and Obedience\\nThe power of the situation can lead people to conform, or go along with the group, even in the face of\\ninaccurate information. Conformity to group norms is driven by two motivations, the desire to fit in and be\\nliked and the desire to be accurate and gain information from the group. Authority figures also have influence\\nover our behaviors, and many people become obedient and follow orders even if the orders are contrary to\\ntheir personal values. Conformity to group pressures can also result in groupthink, or the faulty decision-\\nmaking process that results from cohesive group members trying to maintain group harmony. Group\\nsituations can improve human behavior through facilitating performance on easy tasks, but inhibiting\\nperformance on difficult tasks. The presence of others can also lead to social loafing when individual efforts\\ncannot be evaluated.\\n12.5 Prejudice and Discrimination\\nAs diverse individuals, humans can experience conflict when interacting with people who are different from\\neach other. Prejudice, or negative feelings and evaluations, is common when people are from a different social\\ngroup (i.e., out-group). Negative attitudes toward out-groups can lead to discrimination. Prejudice and\\ndiscrimination against others can be based on gender, race, ethnicity, social class, sexual orientation, or a\\nvariety of other social identities. In-group’s who feel threatened may blame the out-groups for their plight, thus\\nusing the out-group as a scapegoat for their frustration.\\n12 • Summary 439\\n12.6 Aggression\\nAggression is seeking to cause another person harm or pain. Hostile aggression is motivated by feelings of\\nanger with intent to cause pain, and instrumental aggression is motivated by achieving a goal and does not\\nnecessarily involve intent to cause pain Bullying is an international public health concern that largely affects\\nthe adolescent population. Bullying is repeated behaviors that are intended to inflict harm on the victim and\\ncan take the form of physical, psychological, emotional, or social abuse. Bullying has negative mental health\\nconsequences for youth including suicide. Cyberbullying is a newer form of bullying that takes place in an\\nonline environment where bullies can remain anonymous and victims are helpless to address the harassment.\\nDespite the social norm of helping others in need, when there are many bystanders witnessing an emergency,\\ndiffusion of responsibility will lead to a lower likelihood of any one person helping.\\n12.7 Prosocial Behavior\\nAltruism is a pure form of helping others out of empathy, which can be contrasted with egoistic motivations for\\nhelping. Forming relationships with others is a necessity for social beings. We typically form relationships with\\npeople who are close to us in proximity and people with whom we share similarities. We expect reciprocity and\\nself-disclosure in our relationships. We also want to form relationships with people who are physically\\nattractive, though standards for attractiveness vary by culture and gender. There are many types of love that\\nare determined by various combinations of intimacy, passion, and commitment; consummate love, which is\\nthe ideal form of love, contains all three components. When determining satisfaction and whether to maintain\\na relationship, individuals often use a social exchange approach and weigh the costs and benefits of forming\\nand maintaining a relationship.\\nReview Questions\\n1.

Your answer length: less or equal 150 tokens. Plain text, no Markdown. Answer only, no other questions. Context: equally likely to give dispositional and external explanations. This supports the idea that actors tend to provide few internal explanations but many situational explanations for their own behavior. In contrast, observers tend to provide more dispositional explanations for a friend’s behavior (Figure 12.5). FIGURE 12.5 Actor-observer bias is evident when subjects explain their own reasons for liking a girlfriend versus their impressions of others’ reasons for liking a girlfriend. Self-Serving Bias We can understand self-serving bias by digging more deeply into attribution, a belief about the cause of a result. One model of attribution proposes three main dimensions: locus of control (internal versus external), stability (stable versus unstable), and controllability (controllable versus uncontrollable). In this context, stability refers to the extent in which the circumstances that result in a given outcome are changeable. The circumstances are considered stable if they are unlikely to change. Controllability refers to the extent to which the circumstances that are associated with a given outcome can be controlled. Obviously, those things that we have the power to control would be labeled controllable (Weiner, 1979). Following an outcome, self-serving biases are those attributions that enable us to see ourselves in a favorable light (for example, making internal attributions for success and external attributions for failures). When you do well at a task, for example acing an exam, it is in your best interest to make a dispositional attribution for your behavior (“I’m smart,”) instead of a situational one (“The exam was easy,”). Self-serving bias is the tendency to explain our successes as due to dispositional (internal) characteristics, but to explain our failures as due to situational (external) factors. Again, this is culture dependent. This bias serves to protect self-esteem. You can imagine that if people always made situational attributions for their behavior, they would never be able to take credit and feel good about their accomplishments. Consider the example of how we explain our favorite sports team’s wins. Research shows that we make internal, stable, and controllable attributions for our team’s victory (Figure 12.6) (Grove, Hanushek, & Krueger, 2001). For example: “I know my team is better than the other team because they have won more games than me,” or “My team has won because I am a better player than them.” These are all examples of internal attributions. However, we also make external, unstable, uncontrollably attributing the victory to external factors, such as the weather or luck. For instance, “It was a great game because it was sunny and I was in the right place at the right time.” This is an external attribution because we can’t change the outcome of the game. We can’t control whether it’s sunny or not, nor can we change our position or time of day. These external and unstable attribution are the ones that make us feel like we are better at our sport than we really are. They also make us believe that other people are not as good at their sport as they think. So, if you are a basketball player and you win a game, you will feel better about yourself than you would if someone else won the same game. That’s why we feel so good when we do well at something, even if we don’t deserve to be so happy. However, there is a problem with this internal attribution. If you think that your team wins because you are the best player on the team, then you won’t be as happy about your own performance as you might be if you thought that you were the only one who could win. Therefore, the attribution you give yourself is not consistent with your actual performance, which is what we want to know. It is important to keep in mind that attribution is just one of many factors that influence our self-perception. Other factors include self-efficacy, self-esteem, social support, life satisfaction, etc. But attribution plays a very important role in our perception of ourselves and our ability to perform well in various situations. In the next section we will look at another type of bias, called self-fulfilling prophecies, that can occur when people attribute their successes or failures to internal or external factors, rather than to their personal characteristics or abilities. (For more information on this topic, see Chapter 7.) Self-Reported Attribution Attribution is also an important aspect of self-awareness.

While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember\\nwhat he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is\\nassociated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend’s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John\\nNash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would\\ntell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended\\nfor him. He also began to hear voices and became suspicious of the people around him. Soon thereafter, Nash\\nwas diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a state-run mental institution (O’Connor & Robertson,\\n1Introduction to Psychology\\n2002). Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these\\nexperiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain’s internal\\nprocesses and people’s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of\\npsychology has explored these questions.\\n1.1 What Is Psychology?\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Define psychology\\n• Understand the merits of an education in psychology\\nWhat is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology\\nexplores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists\\nuse the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question\\nabout how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the\\nphenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or\\ngroup of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over\\ntime. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes\\nobservations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then\\npublished or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.\\nScientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because\\nit is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We\\nmust ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However,\\nwe can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus,\\npsychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.\\nIn general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot\\narrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the\\nmind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific\\nmethod is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on\\nobservation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or\\nprevious authorities.\\nIt was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this\\ntime, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is,\\nat its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological\\norganism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore,\\npsychology is also a social science.\\nWHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?\\nOften, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to\\nlearn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course\\nbecause it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as\\nnursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare\\npsychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses\\nacross the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology\\nmajors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook’s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality\\nand political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About\\n6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S.\\nDepartment of Education, 2016).\\n8 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nAn education in psychology is valuable for a number of reasons. Psychology students hone critical thinking\\nskills and are trained in the use of the scientific method. Critical thinking is the active application of a set of\\nskills to information for the understanding and evaluation of that information. The evaluation of\\ninformation—assessing its reliability and usefulness— is an important skill in a world full of competing “facts,”\\nmany of which are designed to be misleading. For example, critical thinking involves maintaining an attitude\\nof skepticism, recognizing internal biases, making use of logical thinking, asking appropriate questions, and\\nmaking observations. Psychology students also can develop better communication skills during the course of\\ntheir undergraduate coursework (American Psychological Association, 2011). Together, these factors increase\\nstudents’ scientific literacy and prepare students to critically evaluate the various sources of information they\\nencounter.\\nIn addition to these broad-based skills, psychology students come to understand the complex factors that\\nshape one’s behavior. They appreciate the interaction of our biology, our environment, and our experiences in\\ndetermining who we are and how we will behave. They learn about basic principles that guide how we think\\nand behave, and they come to recognize the tremendous diversity that exists across individuals and across\\ncultural boundaries (American Psychological Association, 2011).\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nWatch a brief video about some questions to consider before deciding to major in psychology\\n(http://openstax.org/l/psycmajor) to learn more.\\n1.2 History of Psychology\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Understand the importance of Wundt and James in the development of psychology\\n• Appreciate Freud’s influence on psychology\\n• Understand the basic tenets of Gestalt psychology\\n• Appreciate the important role that behaviorism played in psychology’s history\\n• Understand basic tenets of humanism\\n• Understand how the cognitive revolution shifted psychology’s focus back to the mind\\nPsychology is a relatively young science with its experimental roots in the 19th century, compared, for\\nexample, to human physiology, which dates much earlier. As mentioned, anyone interested in exploring issues\\nrelated to the mind generally did so in a philosophical context prior to the 19th century. Two 19th century\\nscholars, Wilhelm Wundt and William James, are generally credited as being the founders of psychology as a\\nscience and academic discipline that was distinct from philosophy. This section will provide an overview of the\\nshifts in paradigms that have influenced psychology from Wundt and James through today.\\nWundt and Structuralism\\nWilhelm Wundt (1832–1920) was a German scientist who was the first person to be referred to as a\\npsychologist. His famous book entitled Principles of Physiological Psychology was published in 1873. Wundt\\nviewed psychology as a scientific study of conscious experience, and he believed that the goal of psychology\\nwas to identify components of consciousness and how those components combined to result in our conscious\\nexperience. Wundt used introspection (he called it “internal perception”), a process by which someone\\nexamines their own conscious experience as objectively as possible, making the human mind like any other\\naspect of nature that a scientist observed. He believed in the notion of voluntarism—that people have free will\\nand should know the intentions of a psychological experiment if they were participating (Danziger, 1980).\\nWundt considered his version experimental introspection; he used instruments such as those that measured\\nreaction time. He also wrote Volkerpsychologie in 1904 in which he suggested that psychology should include\\nthe study of culture, as it involves the study of people. Edward Titchener, one of his students, went on to\\n1.2 • History of Psychology 9\\ndevelop structuralism. Its focus was on the contents of mental processes rather than their function (Pickren &\\nRutherford, 2010). Wundt established his psychology laboratory at the University at Leipzig in 1879 (Figure\\n1.2). In this laboratory, Wundt and his students conducted experiments on, for example, reaction times. A\\nsubject, sometimes in a room isolated from the scientist, would receive a stimulus such as a light, image, or\\nsound. The subject’s reaction to the stimulus would be to push a button, and an apparatus would record the\\ntime to reaction. Wundt could measure reaction time to one-thousandth of a second (Nicolas & Ferrand, 1999).\\nFIGURE 1.2 (a) Wilhelm Wundt is credited as one of the founders of psychology. He created the first laboratory for\\npsychological research. (b) This photo shows him seated and surrounded by fellow researchers and equipment in\\nhis laboratory in Germany.\\nHowever, despite his efforts to train individuals in the process of introspection, this process remained highly\\nsubjective, and there was very little agreement between individuals.\\nFunctionalism\\nWilliam James, John Dewey, and Charles Sanders Peirce helped establish functional psychology (Figure 1.3).\\nThey accepted Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection and viewed this theory as an explanation of an\\norganism’s characteristics. Key to that theory is the idea that natural selection leads to organisms that are\\nadapted to their environment, including their behavior. Adaptation means that a trait of an organism has a\\nfunction for the survival and reproduction of the individual, because it has been naturally selected. As James\\nsaw it, psychology’s purpose was to study the function of behavior in the world, and as such, his perspective\\nwas known as functionalism. Functionalism focused on how mental activities helped an organism fit into its\\nenvironment. Functionalism has a second, more subtle meaning in that functionalists were more interested in\\nthe operation of the whole mind rather than of its individual parts, which were the focus of structuralism. Like\\nWundt, James believed that introspection could serve as one means by which someone might study mental\\nactivities, but James also relied on more objective measures, including the use of various recording devices,\\nand examinations of concrete products of mental activities and of anatomy and physiology (Gordon, 1995).\\n10 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nthose with different political ideals. Remarkably, political polarization leads to open levels of discrimination\\nthat are on par with, or perhaps exceed, racial discrimination (Iyengar & Westwood, 2015). A more everyday\\nexample is a group’s discussion of how attractive someone is. Does your opinion change if you find someone\\nattractive, but your friends do not agree? If your friends vociferously agree, might you then find this person\\neven more attractive?\\nSocial traps refer to situations that arise when individuals or groups of individuals behave in ways that are not\\nin their best interest and that may have negative, long-term consequences. However, once established, a social\\ntrap is very difficult to escape. For example, following World War II, the United States and the former Soviet\\nUnion engaged in a nuclear arms race. While the presence of nuclear weapons is not in either party\\'s best\\ninterest, once the arms race began, each country felt the need to continue producing nuclear weapons to\\nprotect itself from the other.\\nSocial Loafing\\nImagine you were just assigned a group project with other students whom you barely know. Everyone in your\\ngroup will get the same grade. Are you the type who will do most of the work, even though the final grade will\\nbe shared? Or are you more likely to do less work because you know others will pick up the slack? Social\\nloafing involves a reduction in individual output on tasks where contributions are pooled. Because each\\nindividual\\'s efforts are not evaluated, individuals can become less motivated to perform well. Karau and\\nWilliams (1993) and Simms and Nichols (2014) reviewed the research on social loafing and discerned when it\\nwas least likely to happen. The researchers noted that social loafing could be alleviated if, among other\\nsituations, individuals knew their work would be assessed by a manager (in a workplace setting) or instructor\\n(in a classroom setting), or if a manager or instructor required group members to complete self-evaluations.\\nThe likelihood of social loafing in student work groups increases as the size of the group increases (Shepperd &\\nTaylor, 1999). According to Kamau and Williams (1993), college students were the population most likely to\\nengage in social loafing. Their study also found that women and participants from collectivistic cultures were\\nless likely to engage in social loafing, explaining that their group orientation may account for this.\\nCollege students could work around social loafing or “free-riding” by suggesting to their professors use of a\\nflocking method to form groups. Harding (2018) compared groups of students who had self-selected into\\ngroups for class to those who had been formed by flocking, which involves assigning students to groups who\\nhave similar schedules and motivations. Not only did she find that students reported less “free riding,” but that\\nthey also did better in the group assignments compared to those whose groups were self-selected.\\nInterestingly, the opposite of social loafing occurs when the task is complex and difficult (Bond & Titus, 1983;\\nGeen, 1989). In a group setting, such as the student work group, if your individual performance cannot be\\nevaluated, there is less pressure for you to do well, and thus less anxiety or physiological arousal (Latané,\\nWilliams, & Harkens, 1979). This puts you in a relaxed state in which you can perform your best, if you choose\\n(Zajonc, 1965). If the task is a difficult one, many people feel motivated and believe that their group needs their\\ninput to do well on a challenging project (Jackson & Williams, 1985).\\nDeindividuation\\nAnother way that being part of a group can affect behavior is exhibited in instances in which deindividuation\\noccurs. Deindividuation refers to situations in which a person may feel a sense of anonymity and therefore a\\nreduction in accountability and sense of self when among others. Deindividuation is often pointed to in cases\\nin which mob or riot-like behaviors occur (Zimbardo, 1969), but research on the subject and the role that\\ndeindividuation plays in such behaviors has resulted in inconsistent results (as discussed in Granström, Guvå,\\nHylander, & Rosander, 2009).\\nTable 12.2 summarizes the types of social influence you have learned about in this chapter.\\n12.4 • Conformity, Compliance, and Obedience 421\\nTypes of Social Influence\\nType of Social\\nInfluence Description\\nConformity Changing your behavior to go along with the group even if you do not agree with the group\\nCompliance Going along with a request or demand\\nNormative\\nsocial influence Conformity to a group norm to fit in, feel good, and be accepted by the group\\nInformational\\nsocial influence\\nConformity to a group norm prompted by the belief that the group is competent and has the\\ncorrect information\\nObedience Changing your behavior to please an authority figure or to avoid aversive consequences\\nGroupthink Tendency to prioritize group cohesion over critical thinking that might lead to poor decision\\nmaking; more likely to occur when there is perceived unanimity among the group\\nGroup\\npolarization Strengthening of the original group attitude after discussing views within a group\\nSocial loafing Exertion of less effort by a person working in a group because individual performance cannot be\\nevaluated separately from the group, thus causing performance decline on easy tasks\\nDeindividuation Group situation in which a person may feel a sense of anonymity and a resulting reduction in\\naccountability and sense of self\\nTABLE 12.2\\n12.5 Prejudice and Discrimination\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Define and distinguish among prejudice, stereotypes, and discrimination\\n• Provide examples of prejudice, stereotypes, and discrimination\\n• Explain why prejudice and discrimination exist\\nHuman conflict can result in crime, war, and mass murder, such as genocide. Prejudice and discrimination\\noften are root causes of human conflict, which explains how strangers come to hate one another to the extreme\\nof causing others harm. Prejudice and discrimination affect everyone. In this section we will examine the\\ndefinitions of prejudice and discrimination, examples of these concepts, and causes of these biases.\\nFIGURE 12.21 Prejudice and discrimination occur across the globe.

(credit b: modification of work\\nby United States Farm Security Administration)\\nUnderstanding Prejudice and Discrimination\\nAs we discussed in the opening story of Trayvon Martin, humans are very diverse and although we share many\\nsimilarities, we also have many differences. The social groups we belong to help form our identities (Tajfel,\\n1974). These differences may be difficult for some people to reconcile, which may lead to prejudice toward\\npeople who are different. Prejudice is a negative attitude and feeling toward an individual based solely on\\none’s membership in a particular social group (Allport, 1954; Brown, 2010). Prejudice is common against\\npeople who are members of an unfamiliar cultural group. Thus, certain types of education, contact,\\ninteractions, and building relationships with members of different cultural groups can reduce the tendency\\ntoward prejudice. In fact, simply imagining interacting with members of different cultural groups might affect\\nprejudice. Indeed, when experimental participants were asked to imagine themselves positively interacting\\nwith someone from a different group, this led to an increased positive attitude toward the other group and an\\nincrease in positive traits associated with the other group. Furthermore, imagined social interaction can\\nreduce anxiety associated with inter-group interactions (Crisp & Turner, 2009). What are some examples of\\nsocial groups that you belong to that contribute to your identity? Social groups can include gender, race,\\nethnicity, nationality, social class, religion, sexual orientation, profession, and many more. And, as is true for\\nsocial roles, you can simultaneously be a member of more than one social group. An example of prejudice is\\nhaving a negative attitude toward people who are not born in the United States. Although people holding this\\nprejudiced attitude do not know all people who were not born in the United States, they dislike them due to\\ntheir status as foreigners.\\nCan you think of a prejudiced attitude you have held toward a group of people? How did your prejudice\\ndevelop? Prejudice often begins in the form of a stereotype—that is, a specific belief or assumption about\\nindividuals based solely on their membership in a group, regardless of their individual characteristics.\\nStereotypes become overgeneralized and applied to all members of a group. For example, someone holding\\nprejudiced attitudes toward older adults, may believe that older adults are slow and incompetent (Cuddy,\\nNorton, & Fiske, 2005; Nelson, 2004). We cannot possibly know each individual person of advanced age to\\nknow that all older adults are slow and incompetent. Therefore, this negative belief is overgeneralized to all\\nmembers of the group, even though many of the individual group members may in fact be spry and intelligent.\\nAnother example of a well-known stereotype involves beliefs about racial differences among athletes. As\\nHodge, Burden, Robinson, and Bennett (2008) point out, Black athletes are often believed to be more athletic,\\nyet less intelligent, than their White counterparts. These beliefs persist despite a number of high profile\\nexamples to the contrary. Sadly, such beliefs often influence how these athletes are treated by others and how\\nthey view themselves and their own capabilities. Whether or not you agree with a stereotype, stereotypes are\\ngenerally well-known within a given culture (Devine, 1989).\\nSometimes people will act on their prejudiced attitudes toward a group of people, and this behavior is known\\nas discrimination. Discrimination is negative action toward an individual as a result of one’s membership in a\\nparticular group (Allport, 1954; Dovidio & Gaertner, 2004). As a result of holding negative beliefs (stereotypes)\\nand negative attitudes (prejudice) about a particular group, people often treat the target of prejudice poorly,\\nsuch as excluding older adults from their circle of friends. In this way, discrimination is a form of oppression.\\nAn example of a psychologist experiencing gender discrimination is found in the life and studies of Mary\\nWhiton Calkins. Calkins was given special permission to attend graduate seminars at Harvard (at that time in\\nthe late 1880s, Harvard did not accept women) and at one point was the sole student of the famous\\npsychologist William James. She passed all the requirements needed for a PhD and was described by\\npsychologist Hugo Münsterberg as “one of the strongest professors of psychology in this country.” However,\\nHarvard refused to grant Calkins a PhD because she was a woman (Harvard University, 2019). Table 12.3\\n12.5 • Prejudice and Discrimination 423\\nsummarizes the characteristics of stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination. Have you ever been the target of\\ndiscrimination? If so, how did this negative treatment make you feel?\\nConnecting Stereotypes, Prejudice, and Discrimination\\nItem Function Connection Example\\nStereotype Cognitive; thoughts\\nabout people\\nOvergeneralized beliefs about people\\nmay lead to prejudice.\\n“Yankees fans are arrogant\\nand obnoxious.”\\nPrejudice\\nAffective; feelings\\nabout people, both\\npositive and\\nnegative\\nFeelings may influence treatment of\\nothers, leading to discrimination.\\n“I hate Yankees fans; they\\nmake me angry.”\\nDiscrimination\\nBehavior; positive\\nor negative\\ntreatment of others\\nHolding stereotypes and harboring\\nprejudice may lead to excluding,\\navoiding, and biased treatment of group\\nmembers.\\n“I would never hire nor\\nbecome friends with a person\\nif I knew they were a Yankees\\nfan.”\\nTABLE 12.3\\nSo far, we’ve discussed stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination as negative thoughts, feelings, and\\nbehaviors because these are typically the most problematic. However, it is important to also point out that\\npeople can hold positive thoughts, feelings, and behaviors toward individuals based on group membership; for\\nexample, they would show preferential treatment for people who are like themselves—that is, who share the\\nsame gender, race, or favorite sports team.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nWatch this video of a social experiment conducted in a park (http://openstax.org/l/racismexp) that\\ndemonstrates the concepts of prejudice, stereotypes, and discrimination. In the video, three people try to steal\\na bike out in the open. The race and gender of the thief is varied: a White male teenager, a Black male teenager,\\nand a White female. Does anyone try to stop them? The treatment of the teenagers in the video demonstrates\\nthe concept of racism.\\nPrejudice and Discrimination\\nWhen we meet strangers we automatically process three pieces of information about them: their race, gender,\\nand age (Ito & Urland, 2003). Why are these aspects of an unfamiliar person so important? Why don’t we\\ninstead notice whether their eyes are friendly, whether they are smiling, their height, the type of clothes they\\nare wearing? Although these secondary characteristics are important in forming a first impression of a\\nstranger, the social categories of race, gender, and age provide a wealth of information about an individual.\\nThis information, however, often is based on stereotypes. We may have different expectations of strangers\\ndepending on their race, gender, and age. What stereotypes and prejudices do you hold about people who are\\nfrom a race, gender, and age group different from your own?\\nRacism\\nRacism is prejudice and discrimination against an individual based solely on one’s membership in a specific\\nracial group (such as toward African Americans, Asian Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, European\\nAmericans). What are some stereotypes of various racial or ethnic groups? Research suggests cultural\\nstereotypes for Asian Americans include cold, sly, and intelligent; for Latinos, cold and unintelligent; for\\n424 12 • Social Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nEuropean Americans, cold and intelligent; and for African Americans, aggressive, athletic, and more likely to\\nbe law breakers (Devine & Elliot, 1995; Fiske, Cuddy, Glick, & Xu, 2002; Sommers & Ellsworth, 2000; Dixon &\\nLinz, 2000).\\nRacism exists for many racial and ethnic groups. For example, Black people are significantly more likely to\\nhave their vehicles searched during traffic stops than White people, particularly when Black people are driving\\nin predominately White neighborhoods, a phenomenon often termed “DWB” or “driving while Black” (Rojek,\\nRosenfeld, & Decker, 2012).\\nMexican Americans and other Latino groups also are targets of racism from the police and other members of\\nthe community. For example, when purchasing items with a personal check, Latino shoppers are more likely\\nthan White shoppers to be asked to show formal identification (Dovidio et al., 2010).\\nIn one case of alleged harassment by the police, several East Haven, Connecticut, police officers were arrested\\non federal charges due to reportedly continued harassment and brutalization of Latinos. When the accusations\\ncame out, the mayor of East Haven was asked, “What are you doing for the Latino community today?” The\\nMayor responded, “I might have tacos when I go home, I’m not quite sure yet” (“East Haven Mayor,” 2012). This\\nstatement undermines the important issue of racial profiling and police harassment of Latinos, while belittling\\nLatino culture by emphasizing an interest in a food product stereotypically associated with Latinos.\\nRacism is prevalent toward many other groups in the United States including Native Americans, Arab\\nAmericans, Jewish Americans, and Asian Americans. Have you experienced or witnessed racism toward any of\\nthese racial or ethnic groups? Are you aware of racism in your community?\\nOne reason modern forms of racism, and prejudice in general, are hard to detect is related to the dual attitudes\\nmodel (Wilson, Lindsey, & Schooler, 2000). Humans have two forms of attitudes: explicit attitudes, which are\\nconscious and controllable, and implicit attitudes, which are unconscious and uncontrollable (Devine, 1989;\\nOlson & Fazio, 2003). Because holding egalitarian views is socially desirable (Plant & Devine, 1998), most\\npeople do not show extreme racial bias or other prejudices on measures of their explicit attitudes. However,\\nmeasures of implicit attitudes often show evidence of mild to strong racial bias or other prejudices (Greenwald,\\nMcGee, & Schwartz, 1998; Olson & Fazio, 2003).\\nSexism\\nSexism is prejudice and discrimination toward individuals based on their sex. Typically, sexism takes the form\\nof men holding biases against women, but anyone can show sexism toward their own or the other sex. Like\\nracism, sexism may be subtle and difficult to detect. Common forms of sexism in modern society include\\ngender role expectations, such as expecting women to be the caretakers of the household. Sexism also includes\\npeople’s expectations for how members of a gender group should behave. For example, women are expected to\\nbe friendly, passive, and nurturing, and when women behave in an unfriendly, assertive, or neglectful manner\\nthey often are disliked for violating their gender role (Rudman, 1998). Research by Laurie Rudman (1998) finds\\nthat when female job applicants self-promote, they are likely to be viewed as competent, but they may be\\ndisliked and are less likely to be hired because they violated gender expectations for modesty. In this way,\\nwomen are sometimes blamed for wage and employment inequality, but they would be viewed negatively for\\ntrying to overcome them, a phenomenon sometimes referred to as the double bind. Sexism can exist on a\\nsocietal level such as in hiring, employment opportunities, and education. Women are less likely to be hired or\\npromoted in male-dominated professions such as engineering, aviation, and construction (Figure 12.22) (Blau,\\nFerber, & Winkler, 2010; Ceci & Williams, 2011). Have you ever experienced or witnessed sexism? Think about\\nyour family members’ jobs or careers. Why do you think there are differences in the jobs women and men\\nhave, such as more women nurses but more male surgeons (Betz, 2008)?\\n12.5 • Prejudice and Discrimination 425\\nFIGURE 12.22 Women now have many jobs previously closed to them, though they still face challenges in men-\\ndominated occupations. (credit: \"The National Guard\"/Flickr)\\nAgeism\\nPeople often form judgments and hold expectations about people based on their age. These judgments and\\nexpectations can lead to ageism, or prejudice and discrimination toward individuals based solely on their age.\\nThink of expectations you hold for older adults. How could someone’s expectations influence the feelings they\\nhold toward individuals from older age groups? Ageism is widespread in U.S. culture (Nosek, 2005), and a\\ncommon ageist attitude toward older adults is that they are incompetent, physically weak, and slow\\n(Greenberg, Schimel, & Martens, 2002) and some people consider older adults less attractive. Chang, Kannoth,\\nLevy, Wang, Lee, and Levy (2020) reported on relationships between ageism and health outcomes over a\\n40-year-plus period from countries around the world. Across 11 health domains, people over 50 were likely to\\nexperience ageism most often in the form of being denied access to health services and work opportunities.\\nSome cultures, however, including some Asian, Latino, and African American cultures, both outside and within\\nthe United States afford older adults respect and honor.\\nTypically, ageism occurs against older adults, but ageism also can occur toward younger adults. What\\nexpectations do you hold toward younger people? Does society expect younger adults to be immature and\\nirresponsible? Are younger generations seen as having it too easy or having weaker characters than older\\ngenerations? Raymer, Reed, Spiegel, and Purvanova (2017) examined ageism against younger workers. They\\nfound that older workers endorsed negative stereotypes of younger workers, believing that they had more work\\ndeficit characteristics (including perceptions of incompetence). How might these forms of ageism affect a\\nyounger and older adult who are applying for a sales clerk position?\\nHomophobia and Transphobia\\nAnother form of prejudice is homophobia: an umbrella term referring to prejudice and discrimination of\\nindividuals based solely on their sexual orientation, which is often applied to bisexual, lesbian, gay, and other\\nnon-heterosexual people. Transphobia is the hatred or fear of those who are perceived to break or blur\\nstereotypical gender roles, often expressed as stereotyping, discrimination, harassment and/or violence. Like\\nageism, homophobia is a widespread prejudice in U.S. society that is tolerated by many people (Herek &\\nMcLemore, 2013; Nosek, 2005). Negative feelings often result in discrimination, such as the exclusion of\\nlesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) people from social groups and the avoidance of\\nLGBTQ+ neighbors and co-workers. This discrimination also extends to employers deliberately declining to\\nhire qualified LGBTQ+ job applicants, a practice officially outlawed by a 2020 Surpreme Court decision but\\nwhich remains a significant issue. Have you experienced or witnessed homophobia? If so, what stereotypes,\\nprejudiced attitudes, and discrimination were evident?\\n426 12 • Social Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\n', 'answer': 'Answer VERY concisely from the provided context only.

While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember what he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is associated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend’s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John Nash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would tell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended for him. He also began to hear voices in his head that he could not control. When he tried to stop them, they would come back to him, and when he did not want them to, the voices would leave him (Wearing, n.d.). These are just a few of the many examples of how people experience the world around them in ways that are unpredictable and difficult to understand. In this chapter, we will explore what psychology is, what it is not, and how it has evolved over time. We will also look at some common misconceptions about psychology. Finally, we will discuss some careers in psychology and the role that psychology plays in our lives. 2. WHAT IS PSYCHOLOGY? The word “psychology” comes from two Greek words, “psyche” and “logos,” which mean “mind” or “thinking.” Psychologists are interested in how the mind works and how we think and feel. They study the mental processes that occur in the brain, such as perception, attention, memory, thinking, problem solving, emotion, motivation, learning, decision making, self-regulation, personality, social behavior, etc. Psychologists use a variety of methods to study these processes, including observation, experiments, surveys, interviews, questionnaires, brain imaging, neuropsychology, cognitive neuroscience, psychometrics, clinical psychology, developmental psychology, ethnopsychology and social psychology. Psychology has a long and rich history. It has been practiced for thousands of years in many different cultures and societies. For example, in ancient Greece, Plato and Aristotle studied psychology in order to understand the nature of human beings and their relationships with each other and with their environment. In the Middle Ages, Christian theologians and philosophers used psychology as a tool for understanding the nature of God and his relationship with his creatures. During the Renaissance, scientists and thinkers such as Galileo Galilei, Isaac Newton, René Descartes, John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Auguste Comte, Jean-Paul Sartre, Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, William James, Edward Thorndike, B.F. Skinner and others developed theories of psychology that continue to shape our understanding of this field today. Today, psychology is a broad and diverse field that encompasses a wide range of subfields and disciplines. Some of these disciplines include: • Clinical psychology: This field focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders, as well as', 'references': '{\"sections\": [\"Social Psychology/Prosocial Behavior\", \"Introduction to Psychology/Contemporary Psychology\"], \"pages\": [\"435\", \"436\", \"20\"]}'}\n",
      "Response for query ID 45: {'context': 'FIGURE 1.7 Maslow’s hierarchy of needs is shown.\\nCarl Rogers (1902–1987) was also an American psychologist who, like Maslow, emphasized the potential for\\ngood that exists within all people (Figure 1.8). Rogers used a therapeutic technique known as client-centered\\ntherapy in helping his clients deal with problematic issues that resulted in their seeking psychotherapy. Unlike\\na psychoanalytic approach in which the therapist plays an important role in interpreting what conscious\\nbehavior reveals about the unconscious mind, client-centered therapy involves the patient taking a lead role in\\nthe therapy session. Rogers believed that a therapist needed to display three features to maximize the\\neffectiveness of this particular approach: unconditional positive regard, genuineness, and empathy.\\nUnconditional positive regard refers to the fact that the therapist accepts their client for who they are, no\\nmatter what they might say. Provided these factors, Rogers believed that people were more than capable of\\ndealing with and working through their own issues (Thorne & Henley, 2005).\\nFIGURE 1.8 Carl Rogers, shown in this portrait, developed a client-centered therapy method that has been\\ninfluential in clinical settings. (credit: \"Didius\"/Wikimedia Commons)\\nHumanism has been influential to psychology as a whole. Both Maslow and Rogers are well-known names\\namong students of psychology (you will read more about both later in this text), and their ideas have influenced\\nmany scholars. Furthermore, Rogers’ client-centered approach to therapy is still commonly used in\\npsychotherapeutic settings today (O’hara, n.d.)\\n1.2 • History of Psychology 15\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nView a brief video of Carl Rogers describing his therapeutic approach (http://openstax.org/l/crogers1) to learn\\nmore.\\nThe Cognitive Revolution\\nBehaviorism’s emphasis on objectivity and focus on external behavior had pulled psychologists’ attention away\\nfrom the mind for a prolonged period of time. The early work of the humanistic psychologists redirected\\nattention to the individual human as a whole, and as a conscious and self-aware being. By the 1950s, new\\ndisciplinary perspectives in linguistics, neuroscience, and computer science were emerging, and these areas\\nrevived interest in the mind as a focus of scientific inquiry. This particular perspective has come to be known\\nas the cognitive revolution (Miller, 2003). By 1967, Ulric Neisser published the first textbook entitled Cognitive\\nPsychology, which served as a core text in cognitive psychology courses around the country (Thorne & Henley,\\n2005).\\nAlthough no one person is entirely responsible for starting the cognitive revolution, Noam Chomsky was very\\ninfluential in the early days of this movement (Figure 1.9). Chomsky (1928–), an American linguist, was\\ndissatisfied with the influence that behaviorism had had on psychology. He believed that psychology’s focus on\\nbehavior was short-sighted and that the field had to re-incorporate mental functioning into its purview if it\\nwere to offer any meaningful contributions to understanding behavior (Miller, 2003).\\nFIGURE 1.9 Noam Chomsky was very influential in beginning the cognitive revolution. In 2010, this mural honoring\\nhim was put up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (credit: Robert Moran)\\nEuropean psychology had never really been as influenced by behaviorism as had American psychology; and\\nthus, the cognitive revolution helped reestablish lines of communication between European psychologists and\\ntheir American counterparts. Furthermore, psychologists began to cooperate with scientists in other fields,\\nlike anthropology, linguistics, computer science, and neuroscience, among others. This interdisciplinary\\napproach often was referred to as the cognitive sciences, and the influence and prominence of this particular\\nperspective resonates in modern-day psychology (Miller, 2003).\\nFeminist Psychology\\nThe science of psychology has had an impact on human wellbeing, both positive and negative. The dominant\\ninfluence of Western, White, and male academics in the early history of psychology meant that psychology\\ndeveloped with the biases inherent in those individuals, which often had negative consequences for members of\\nsociety who were not White or male. Women, members of ethnic minorities in both the United States and other\\ncountries, and individuals with sexual orientations other than straight had difficulties entering the field of\\npsychology and therefore influencing its development. They also suffered from the attitudes of White male\\npsychologists who were not immune to the nonscientific attitudes prevalent in the society in which they\\nDIG DEEPER\\n16 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\ndeveloped and worked. Until the 1960s, the science of psychology was largely a “womanless” psychology\\n(Crawford & Marecek, 1989), meaning that few women were able to practice psychology, so they had little\\ninfluence on what was studied. In addition, the experimental subjects of psychology were mostly men, which\\nresulted from underlying assumptions that gender had no influence on psychology and that women were not of\\nsufficient interest to study.\\nAn article by Naomi Weisstein, first published in 1968 (Weisstein, 1993), stimulated a feminist revolution in\\npsychology by presenting a critique of psychology as a science. She also specifically criticized male psychologists\\nfor constructing the psychology of women entirely out of their own cultural biases and without careful\\nexperimental tests to verify any of their characterizations of women. Weisstein used, as examples, statements by\\nprominent psychologists in the 1960s, such as this quote by Bruno Bettleheim: “We must start with the\\nrealization that, as much as women want to be good scientists or engineers, they want first and foremost to be\\nwomanly companions of men and to be mothers.” Weisstein’s critique formed the foundation for the subsequent\\ndevelopment of a feminist psychology that attempted to be free of the influence of male cultural biases on our\\nknowledge of the psychology of women.\\nCrawford & Marecek (1989) identify several feminist approaches to psychology that can be described as feminist\\npsychology. These include re-evaluating and discovering the contributions of women to the history of psychology,\\nstudying psychological gender differences, and questioning the male bias present across the practice of the\\nscientific approach to knowledge.\\nMulticultural And Cross-Cultural Psychology\\nCulture impacts individuals, groups, and society. An ongoing issue researchers are trying to correct is that\\ncertain populations have been over-studied and the results of these studies have been applied to other\\npopulations. For example, Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan discuss how WEIRD societies have been\\noverstudied and the results have been wrongly applied to non-WEIRD societies (2010). WEIRD stands for\\nwestern, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic. Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan found that there are\\nmany differences between people in the WEIRD group and people in less industrialized, less urban, and non-\\nWestern societies. These differences occur in a variety of areas, including perception, cooperation, and moral\\nreasoning. That is, people vary depending on their culture and environment. Multicultural psychologists\\ndevelop theories and conduct research with diverse populations, typically within one country. Cross-cultural\\npsychologists compare populations across countries, such as participants from the United States compared to\\nparticipants from China.\\nIn 1920, Francis Cecil Sumner was the first African American to receive a PhD in psychology in the United\\nStates. Sumner established a psychology degree program at Howard University, leading to the education of a\\nnew generation of African American psychologists (Black, Spence, and Omari, 2004). Much of the work of early\\npsychologists from diverse backgrounds was dedicated to challenging intelligence testing and promoting\\ninnovative educational methods for children. George I. Sanchez contested such testing with Mexican American\\nchildren. As a psychologist of Mexican heritage, he pointed out that the language and cultural barriers in\\ntesting were keeping children from equal opportunities (Guthrie, 1998). By 1940, he was teaching with his\\ndoctoral degree at University of Texas at Austin and challenging segregated educational practices (Romo,\\n1986).\\nTwo famous African American researchers and psychologists are Mamie Phipps Clark and her husband,\\nKenneth Clark. They are best known for their studies conducted on African American children and doll\\npreference, research that was instrumental in the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court desegregation\\ncase. The Clarks applied their research to social services and opened the first child guidance center in Harlem\\n(American Psychological Association, 2019).\\nListen to the podcast below describing the Clarks\\' research and impact on the Supreme Court decision.\\n1.2 • History of Psychology 17\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nListen to a podcast about the influence of an African American\\'s psychology research on the historic Brown v.\\nBoard of Education civil rights case (http://openstax.org/l/crogers2) to learn more.\\nThe American Psychological Association has several ethnically based organizations for professional\\npsychologists that facilitate interactions among members. Since psychologists belonging to specific ethnic\\ngroups or cultures have the most interest in studying the psychology of their communities, these organizations\\nprovide an opportunity for the growth of research on the interplay between culture and psychology.\\nWOMEN IN PSYCHOLOGY\\nAlthough rarely given credit, women have been contributing to psychology since its inception as a field of\\nstudy. In 1894, Margaret Floy Washburn was the first woman awarded the doctoral degree in psychology. She\\nwrote The Animal Mind: A Textbook of Comparative Psychology, and it was the standard in the field for over 20\\nyears. In the mid 1890s, Mary Whiton Calkins completed all requirements toward the PhD in psychology, but\\nHarvard University refused to award her that degree because she was a woman. She had been taught and\\nmentored by William James, who tried and failed to convince Harvard to award her the doctoral degree. Her\\nmemory research studied primacy and recency (Madigan & O’Hara, 1992), and she also wrote about how\\nstructuralism and functionalism both explained self-psychology (Calkins, 1906).\\nAnother influential woman, Mary Cover Jones, conducted a study she considered to be a sequel to John B.\\nWatson’s study of Little Albert (you’ll learn about this study in the chapter on Learning). Jones unconditioned\\nfear in Little Peter, who had been afraid of rabbits (Jones, 1924).\\nEthnic minority women contributing to the field of psychology include Martha Bernal and Inez Beverly Prosser;\\ntheir studies were related to education. Bernal, the first Latina to earn her doctoral degree in psychology\\n(1962) conducted much of her research with Mexican American children. Prosser was the first African\\nAmerican woman awarded the PhD in 1933 at the University of Cincinnati (Benjamin, Henry, & McMahon,\\n2005).\\n1.3 Contemporary Psychology\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Appreciate the diversity of interests and foci within psychology\\n• Understand basic interests and applications in each of the described areas of psychology\\n• Demonstrate familiarity with some of the major concepts or important figures in each of the described areas of\\npsychology\\nContemporary psychology is a diverse field that is influenced by all of the historical perspectives described in\\nthe preceding section. Reflective of the discipline’s diversity is the diversity seen within the American\\nPsychological Association (APA). The APA is a professional organization representing psychologists in the\\nUnited States. The APA is the largest organization of psychologists in the world, and its mission is to advance\\nand disseminate psychological knowledge for the betterment of people. There are 54 divisions within the APA,\\nrepresenting a wide variety of specialties that range from Societies for the Psychology of Religion and\\nSpirituality to Exercise and Sport Psychology to Behavioral Neuroscience and Comparative Psychology.\\nReflecting the diversity of the field of psychology itself, members, affiliate members, and associate members\\nspan the spectrum from students to doctoral-level psychologists, and come from a variety of places including\\neducational settings, criminal justice, hospitals, the armed forces, and industry (American Psychological\\nAssociation, 2014). G. Stanley Hall was the first president of the APA. Before he earned his doctoral degree, he\\nwas an adjunct instructor at Wilberforce University, a historically Black college/university (HBCU), while\\nserving as faculty at Antioch College. Hall went on to work under William James, earning his PhD. Eventually,\\n18 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nhe became the first president of Clark University in Massachusetts when it was founded (Pickren & Rutherford,\\n2010).\\nThe Association for Psychological Science (APS) was founded in 1988 and seeks to advance the scientific\\norientation of psychology. Its founding resulted from disagreements between members of the scientific and\\nclinical branches of psychology within the APA. The APS publishes five research journals and engages in\\neducation and advocacy with funding agencies. A significant proportion of its members are international,\\nalthough the majority is located in the United States. Other organizations provide networking and\\ncollaboration opportunities for professionals of several ethnic or racial groups working in psychology, such as\\nthe National Latina/o Psychological Association (NLPA), the Asian American Psychological Association (AAPA),\\nthe Association of Black Psychologists (ABPsi), and the Society of Indian Psychologists (SIP). Most of these\\ngroups are also dedicated to studying psychological and social issues within their specific communities.\\nThis section will provide an overview of the major subdivisions within psychology today in the order in which\\nthey are introduced throughout the remainder of this textbook. This is not meant to be an exhaustive listing,\\nbut it will provide insight into the major areas of research and practice of modern-day psychologists.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nPlease visit this website about the divisions within the APA (http://openstax.org/l/biopsychology) to learn more.\\nView these student resources (http://openstax.org/l/studentresource) also provided by the APA.\\nBiopsychology and Evolutionary Psychology\\nAs the name suggests, biopsychology explores how our biology influences our behavior. While biological\\npsychology is a broad field, many biological psychologists want to understand how the structure and function\\nof the nervous system is related to behavior (Figure 1.10). As such, they often combine the research strategies\\nof both psychologists and physiologists to accomplish this goal (as discussed in Carlson, 2013).\\nFIGURE 1.10 Biological psychologists study how the structure and function of the nervous system generate\\nbehavior.\\nThe research interests of biological psychologists span a number of domains, including but not limited to,\\n1.3 • Contemporary Psychology 19\\nsensory and motor systems, sleep, drug use and abuse, ingestive behavior, reproductive behavior,\\nneurodevelopment, plasticity of the nervous system, and biological correlates of psychological disorders.\\nGiven the broad areas of interest falling under the purview of biological psychology, it will probably come as no\\nsurprise that individuals from all sorts of backgrounds are involved in this research, including biologists,\\nmedical professionals, physiologists, and chemists. This interdisciplinary approach is often referred to as\\nneuroscience, of which biological psychology is a component (Carlson, 2013).\\nWhile biopsychology typically focuses on the immediate causes of behavior based in the physiology of a\\nhuman or other animal, evolutionary psychology seeks to study the ultimate biological causes of behavior. To\\nthe extent that a behavior is impacted by genetics, a behavior, like any anatomical characteristic of a human or\\nanimal, will demonstrate adaption to its surroundings. These surroundings include the physical environment\\nand, since interactions between organisms can be important to survival and reproduction, the social\\nenvironment. The study of behavior in the context of evolution has its origins with Charles Darwin, the co-\\ndiscoverer of the theory of evolution by natural selection. Darwin was well aware that behaviors should be\\nadaptive and wrote books titled, The Descent of Man (1871) and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and\\nAnimals (1872), to explore this field.\\nEvolutionary psychology, and specifically, the evolutionary psychology of humans, has enjoyed a resurgence in\\nrecent decades. To be subject to evolution by natural selection, a behavior must have a significant genetic\\ncause. In general, we expect all human cultures to express a behavior if it is caused genetically, since the\\ngenetic differences among human groups are small. The approach taken by most evolutionary psychologists is\\nto predict the outcome of a behavior in a particular situation based on evolutionary theory and then to make\\nobservations, or conduct experiments, to determine whether the results match the theory. It is important to\\nrecognize that these types of studies are not strong evidence that a behavior is adaptive, since they lack\\ninformation that the behavior is in some part genetic and not entirely cultural (Endler, 1986). Demonstrating\\nthat a trait, especially in humans, is naturally selected is extraordinarily difficult; perhaps for this reason,\\nsome evolutionary psychologists are content to assume the behaviors they study have genetic determinants\\n(Confer et al., 2010).\\nOne other drawback of evolutionary psychology is that the traits that we possess now evolved under\\nenvironmental and social conditions far back in human history, and we have a poor understanding of what\\nthese conditions were. This makes predictions about what is adaptive for a behavior difficult. Behavioral traits\\nneed not be adaptive under current conditions, only under the conditions of the past when they evolved, about\\nwhich we can only hypothesize.\\nThere are many areas of human behavior for which evolution can make predictions. Examples include\\nmemory, mate choice, relationships between kin, friendship and cooperation, parenting, social organization,\\nand status (Confer et al., 2010).\\nEvolutionary psychologists have had success in finding experimental correspondence between observations\\nand expectations. In one example, in a study of mate preference differences between men and women that\\nspanned 37 cultures, Buss (1989) found that women valued earning potential factors greater than men, and\\nmen valued potential reproductive factors (youth and attractiveness) greater than women in their prospective\\nmates. In general, the predictions were in line with the predictions of evolution, although there were deviations\\nin some cultures.\\nSensation and Perception\\nScientists interested in both physiological aspects of sensory systems as well as in the psychological\\nexperience of sensory information work within the area of sensation and perception (Figure 1.11). As such,\\nsensation and perception research is also quite interdisciplinary. Imagine walking between buildings as you\\nmove from one class to another. You are inundated with sights, sounds, touch sensations, and smells. You also\\nexperience the temperature of the air around you and maintain your balance as you make your way. These are\\n20 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nHow can we go about finding answers that are supported not by mere opinion, but by evidence that we can all\\nagree on? The findings of psychological research can help us navigate issues like this.\\n2.1 Why Is Research Important?\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Explain how scientific research addresses questions about behavior\\n• Discuss how scientific research guides public policy\\n• Appreciate how scientific research can be important in making personal decisions\\nScientific research is a critical tool for successfully navigating our complex world. Without it, we would be\\nforced to rely solely on intuition, other people’s authority, and blind luck. While many of us feel confident in\\nour abilities to decipher and interact with the world around us, history is filled with examples of how very\\nwrong we can be when we fail to recognize the need for evidence in supporting claims. At various times in\\nhistory, we would have been certain that the sun revolved around a flat earth, that the earth’s continents did\\nnot move, and that mental illness was caused by possession (Figure 2.2). It is through systematic scientific\\nresearch that we divest ourselves of our preconceived notions and superstitions and gain an objective\\nunderstanding of ourselves and our world.\\nFIGURE 2.2 Some of our ancestors, across the world and over the centuries, believed that trephination—the\\npractice of making a hole in the skull, as shown here—allowed evil spirits to leave the body, thus curing mental\\nillness and other disorders. (credit: “taiproject”/Flickr)\\nThe goal of all scientists is to better understand the world around them. Psychologists focus their attention on\\nunderstanding behavior, as well as the cognitive (mental) and physiological (body) processes that underlie\\nbehavior. In contrast to other methods that people use to understand the behavior of others, such as intuition\\nand personal experience, the hallmark of scientific research is that there is evidence to support a claim.\\nScientific knowledge is empirical: It is grounded in objective, tangible evidence that can be observed time and\\ntime again, regardless of who is observing.\\nWhile behavior is observable, the mind is not. If someone is crying, we can see behavior. However, the reason\\nfor the behavior is more difficult to determine. Is the person crying due to being sad, in pain, or happy?\\nSometimes we can learn the reason for someone’s behavior by simply asking a question, like “Why are you\\ncrying?” However, there are situations in which an individual is either uncomfortable or unwilling to answer\\nthe question honestly, or is incapable of answering. For example, infants would not be able to explain why they\\nare crying. In such circumstances, the psychologist must be creative in finding ways to better understand\\nbehavior. This chapter explores how scientific knowledge is generated, and how important that knowledge is in\\nforming decisions in our personal lives and in the public domain.\\n36 2 • Psychological Research\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nUse of Research Information\\nTrying to determine which theories are and are not accepted by the scientific community can be difficult,\\nespecially in an area of research as broad as psychology. More than ever before, we have an incredible amount\\nof information at our fingertips, and a simple internet search on any given research topic might result in a\\nnumber of contradictory studies. In these cases, we are witnessing the scientific community going through the\\nprocess of reaching a consensus, and it could be quite some time before a consensus emerges. For example,\\nthe explosion in our use of technology has led researchers to question whether this ultimately helps or hinders\\nus. The use and implementation of technology in educational settings has become widespread over the last few\\ndecades. Researchers are coming to different conclusions regarding the use of technology. To illustrate this\\npoint, a study investigating a smartphone app targeting surgery residents (graduate students in surgery\\ntraining) found that the use of this app can increase student engagement and raise test scores (Shaw & Tan,\\n2015). Conversely, another study found that the use of technology in undergraduate student populations had\\nnegative impacts on sleep, communication, and time management skills (Massimini & Peterson, 2009). Until\\nsufficient amounts of research have been conducted, there will be no clear consensus on the effects that\\ntechnology has on a student\\'s acquisition of knowledge, study skills, and mental health.\\nIn the meantime, we should strive to think critically about the information we encounter by exercising a degree\\nof healthy skepticism. When someone makes a claim, we should examine the claim from a number of different\\nperspectives: what is the expertise of the person making the claim, what might they gain if the claim is valid,\\ndoes the claim seem justified given the evidence, and what do other researchers think of the claim? This is\\nespecially important when we consider how much information in advertising campaigns and on the internet\\nclaims to be based on “scientific evidence” when in actuality it is a belief or perspective of just a few\\nindividuals trying to sell a product or draw attention to their perspectives.\\nWe should be informed consumers of the information made available to us because decisions based on this\\ninformation have significant consequences. One such consequence can be seen in politics and public policy.\\nImagine that you have been elected as the governor of your state. One of your responsibilities is to manage the\\nstate budget and determine how to best spend your constituents’ tax dollars. As the new governor, you need to\\ndecide whether to continue funding early intervention programs. These programs are designed to help\\nchildren who come from low-income backgrounds, have special needs, or face other disadvantages. These\\nprograms may involve providing a wide variety of services to maximize the children\\'s development and\\nposition them for optimal levels of success in school and later in life (Blann, 2005). While such programs\\nsound appealing, you would want to be sure that they also proved effective before investing additional money\\nin these programs. Fortunately, psychologists and other scientists have conducted vast amounts of research on\\nsuch programs and, in general, the programs are found to be effective (Neil & Christensen, 2009; Peters-\\nScheffer, Didden, Korzilius, & Sturmey, 2011). While not all programs are equally effective, and the short-term\\neffects of many such programs are more pronounced, there is reason to believe that many of these programs\\nproduce long-term benefits for participants (Barnett, 2011). If you are committed to being a good steward of\\ntaxpayer money, you would want to look at research. Which programs are most effective? What characteristics\\nof these programs make them effective? Which programs promote the best outcomes? After examining the\\nresearch, you would be best equipped to make decisions about which programs to fund.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nWatch this video about early childhood program effectiveness (http://openstax.org/l/programeffect) to learn\\nhow scientists evaluate effectiveness and how best to invest money into programs that are most effective.\\nUltimately, it is not just politicians who can benefit from using research in guiding their decisions. We all might\\nlook to research from time to time when making decisions in our lives. Imagine you just found out that your\\nsister Maria\\'s child, Umberto, was recently diagnosed with autism. There are many treatments for autism that\\nhelp decrease the negative impact of autism on the individual. Some examples of treatments for autism are\\n2.1 • Why Is Research Important? 37\\napplied behavior analysis (ABA), social communication groups, social skills groups, occupational therapy, and\\neven medication options. If Maria asked you for advice or guidance, what would you do? You would likely want\\nto review the research and learn about the efficacy of each treatment so you could best advise your sister.\\nIn the end, research is what makes the difference between facts and opinions. Facts are observable realities,\\nand opinions are personal judgments, conclusions, or attitudes that may or may not be accurate. In the\\nscientific community, facts can be established only using evidence collected through empirical research.\\nNOTABLE RESEARCHERS\\nPsychological research has a long history involving important figures from diverse backgrounds. While the\\nintroductory chapter discussed several researchers who made significant contributions to the discipline, there\\nare many more individuals who deserve attention in considering how psychology has advanced as a science\\nthrough their work (Figure 2.3). For instance, Margaret Floy Washburn (1871–1939) was the first woman to\\nearn a PhD in psychology. Her research focused on animal behavior and cognition (Margaret Floy Washburn,\\nPhD, n.d.). Mary Whiton Calkins (1863–1930) was a preeminent first-generation American psychologist who\\nopposed the behaviorist movement, conducted significant research into memory, and established one of the\\nearliest experimental psychology labs in the United States (Mary Whiton Calkins, n.d.).\\nFrancis Sumner (1895–1954) was the first African American to receive a PhD in psychology in 1920. His\\ndissertation focused on issues related to psychoanalysis. Sumner also had research interests in racial bias and\\neducational justice. Sumner was one of the founders of Howard University’s department of psychology, and\\nbecause of his accomplishments, he is sometimes referred to as the “Father of Black Psychology.” Thirteen\\nyears later, Inez Beverly Prosser (1895–1934) became the first African American woman to receive a PhD in\\npsychology. Prosser’s research highlighted issues related to education in segregated versus integrated schools,\\nand ultimately, her work was very influential in the hallmark Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court\\nruling that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional (Ethnicity and Health in America Series:\\nFeatured Psychologists, n.d.).\\nFIGURE 2.3 (a) Margaret Floy Washburn was the first woman to earn a doctorate degree in psychology. (b) The\\noutcome of Brown v. Board of Education was influenced by the research of psychologist Inez Beverly Prosser, who\\nwas the first African American woman to earn a PhD in psychology.\\nAlthough the establishment of psychology’s scientific roots occurred first in Europe and the United States, it\\ndid not take much time until researchers from around the world began to establish their own laboratories and\\nresearch programs. For example, some of the first experimental psychology laboratories in South America\\nwere founded by Horatio Piñero (1869–1919) at two institutions in Buenos Aires, Argentina (Godoy & Brussino,\\n2010). In India, Gunamudian David Boaz (1908–1965) and Narendra Nath Sen Gupta (1889–1944) established\\n38 2 • Psychological Research\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nthe first independent departments of psychology at the University of Madras and the University of Calcutta,\\nrespectively. These developments provided an opportunity for Indian researchers to make important\\ncontributions to the field (Gunamudian David Boaz, n.d.; Narendra Nath Sen Gupta, n.d.).\\nWhen the American Psychological Association (APA) was first founded in 1892, all of the members were White\\nmales (Women and Minorities in Psychology, n.d.). However, by 1905, Mary Whiton Calkins was elected as the\\nfirst female president of the APA, and by 1946, nearly one-quarter of American psychologists were female.\\nPsychology became a popular degree option for students enrolled in the nation’s historically Black higher\\neducation institutions, increasing the number of Black Americans who went on to become psychologists. Given\\ndemographic shifts occurring in the United States and increased access to higher educational opportunities\\namong historically underrepresented populations, there is reason to hope that the diversity of the field will\\nincreasingly match the larger population, and that the research contributions made by the psychologists of the\\nfuture will better serve people of all backgrounds (Women and Minorities in Psychology, n.d.).\\nThe Process of Scientific Research\\nScientific knowledge is advanced through a process known as the scientific method. Basically, ideas (in the\\nform of theories and hypotheses) are tested against the real world (in the form of empirical observations), and\\nthose empirical observations lead to more ideas that are tested against the real world, and so on. In this sense,\\nthe scientific process is circular. The types of reasoning within the circle are called deductive and inductive. In\\ndeductive reasoning, ideas are tested in the real world; in inductive reasoning, real-world observations lead\\nto new ideas (Figure 2.4). These processes are inseparable, like inhaling and exhaling, but different research\\napproaches place different emphasis on the deductive and inductive aspects.\\nFIGURE 2.4 Psychological research relies on both inductive and deductive reasoning.\\nIn the scientific context, deductive reasoning begins with a generalization—one hypothesis—that is then used\\nto reach logical conclusions about the real world. If the hypothesis is correct, then the logical conclusions\\nreached through deductive reasoning should also be correct. A deductive reasoning argument might go\\nsomething like this: All living things require energy to survive (this would be your hypothesis). Ducks are living\\nthings. Therefore, ducks require energy to survive (logical conclusion). In this example, the hypothesis is\\ncorrect; therefore, the conclusion is correct as well. Sometimes, however, an incorrect hypothesis may lead to a\\nlogical but incorrect conclusion. Consider this argument: all ducks are born with the ability to see. Quackers is\\na duck. Therefore, Quackers was born with the ability to see. Scientists use deductive reasoning to empirically\\ntest their hypotheses. Returning to the example of the ducks, researchers might design a study to test the\\nhypothesis that if all living things require energy to survive, then ducks will be found to require energy to\\nsurvive.\\nDeductive reasoning starts with a generalization that is tested against real-world observations; however,\\ninductive reasoning moves in the opposite direction. Inductive reasoning uses empirical observations to\\n2.1 • Why Is Research Important? 39\\nconstruct broad generalizations. Unlike deductive reasoning, conclusions drawn from inductive reasoning\\nmay or may not be correct, regardless of the observations on which they are based. For instance, you may\\nnotice that your favorite fruits—apples, bananas, and oranges—all grow on trees; therefore, you assume that all\\nfruit must grow on trees. This would be an example of inductive reasoning, and, clearly, the existence of\\nstrawberries, blueberries, and kiwi demonstrate that this generalization is not correct despite it being based\\non a number of direct observations. Scientists use inductive reasoning to formulate theories, which in turn\\ngenerate hypotheses that are tested with deductive reasoning. In the end, science involves both deductive and\\ninductive processes.\\nFor example, case studies, which you will read about in the next section, are heavily weighted on the side of\\nempirical observations. Thus, case studies are closely associated with inductive processes as researchers\\ngather massive amounts of observations and seek interesting patterns (new ideas) in the data. Experimental\\nresearch, on the other hand, puts great emphasis on deductive reasoning.\\nWe’ve stated that theories and hypotheses are ideas, but what sort of ideas are they, exactly? A theory is a well-\\ndeveloped set of ideas that propose an explanation for observed phenomena. Theories are repeatedly checked\\nagainst the world, but they tend to be too complex to be tested all at once; instead, researchers create\\nhypotheses to test specific aspects of a theory.\\nA hypothesis is a testable prediction about how the world will behave if our idea is correct, and it is often\\nworded as an if-then statement (e.g., if I study all night, I will get a passing grade on the test). The hypothesis is\\nextremely important because it bridges the gap between the realm of ideas and the real world. As specific\\nhypotheses are tested, theories are modified and refined to reflect and incorporate the result of these tests\\nFigure 2.5.\\nFIGURE 2.5 The scientific method involves deriving hypotheses from theories and then testing those hypotheses. If\\nthe results are consistent with the theory, then the theory is supported. If the results are not consistent, then the\\ntheory should be modified and new hypotheses will be generated.\\nTo see how this process works, let’s consider a specific theory and a hypothesis that might be generated from\\nthat theory. As you’ll learn in a later chapter, the James-Lange theory of emotion asserts that emotional\\nexperience relies on the physiological arousal associated with the emotional state. If you walked out of your\\nhome and discovered a very aggressive snake waiting on your doorstep, your heart would begin to race and\\nyour stomach churn.

Carl Rogers (1902–1987) was also an American psychologist who, like Maslow, emphasized the potential for good that exists within all people (Figure 1.8). Rogers used a therapeutic technique known as client-centered therapy in helping his clients deal with problematic issues that resulted in their seeking psychotherapy. Unlike a psychoanalytic approach in which the therapist plays an important role in interpreting what conscious behavior reveals about the unconscious mind, client-centered therapy involves the patient taking a lead role in the therapy session. Rogers believed that a therapist needed to display three features to maximize the effectiveness of this particular approach: unconditional positive regard, genuineness, and empathy. Unconditional positive regard refers to the fact that the therapist accepts their client for who they are, no matter what they might say. Provided these factors, Rogers believed that people were more than capable of dealing with and working through their own issues (Thorne & Henley, 2005). FIGURE 1.8 Carl Rogers, shown in this portrait, developed a client-centered therapy method that has been influential in clinical settings. (credit: \"Didius\"/Wikimedia Commons) Humanism has been influential to psychology as a whole. Both Maslow and Rogers are well-known names among students of psychology (you will read more about both later in this text), and their ideas have influenced many scholars. Furthermore, Rogers’ client-centered approach to therapy is still commonly used in psychotherapeutic settings today (O’hara, n.d.) 1.2 • History of Psychology 15 LINK T O LEARNING View a brief video of Carl Rogers describing his therapeutic approach (http://openstax.org/l/crogers1) to learn more. The Cognitive Revolution Behaviorism’s emphasis on objectivity and focus on external behavior had pulled psychologists’ attention away from the mind for a prolonged period of time. The early work of the humanistic psychologists redirected attention to the individual human as a whole, and as a conscious and self-aware being. By the 1950s, new disciplinary perspectives in linguistics, neuroscience, and computer science were emerging, all of which led to a renewed interest in the study of human behavior and cognition. These new perspectives were referred to as the cognitive revolution. In this chapter, we will examine the major developments in psychology that occurred during this time period. We will also discuss the impact of these developments on the field of psychology today. Cognitive Psychology In the mid-18th century, the French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau argued that humans are born with a natural tendency to seek pleasure and avoid pain. This natural tendency, which he called the “soul’s instinct” (Rousseau, p. 33), is what drives us to act in accordance with our desires and to pursue our goals. However, this natural inclination can also lead to negative consequences. For example, if a person chooses to engage in an activity that is harmful to themselves or others, they may experience negative emotions such as guilt, shame, anger, or fear. As a result, these negative emotions may lead the person to act in ways that are not in line with their natural inclinations. Thus, it is natural for humans to experience negative emotions, but this does not mean that these emotions are inherently bad or harmful. Rather, humans have the ability to control their emotions and use them to achieve their goals. In order to understand how humans can control and change their emotional responses, psychologists developed a theory of emotion. According to this theory, emotions can be divided into two broad categories: emotional states and emotional reactions. An emotional state is a state of mind or mental state that characterizes a particular emotional experience. Emotions are characterized by a range of physical and psychological characteristics, including changes in heart rate, blood pressure, respiration, muscle tension, and skin conductance. Emotional reactions are the outward manifestations of emotional states. They are often associated with physical and psychological symptoms. Emotional reactions can take the form of physiological changes, such as sweating or shivering, as well as behavioral changes. Physiological changes can include increased heart rate, increased breathing, sweating, shaking, trembling, nausea, dizziness, palpitations, tremors, anxiety, restlessness, irritability, agitation, depression, euphoria, excitement, sadness, fear, panic, etc. Behavioral changes can include physical symptoms, emotional symptoms (e.g., anger or sadness), or a combination of both.

While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember\\nwhat he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is\\nassociated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend’s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John\\nNash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would\\ntell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended\\nfor him. He also began to hear voices and became suspicious of the people around him. Soon thereafter, Nash\\nwas diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a state-run mental institution (O’Connor & Robertson,\\n1Introduction to Psychology\\n2002). Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these\\nexperiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain’s internal\\nprocesses and people’s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of\\npsychology has explored these questions.\\n1.1 What Is Psychology?\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Define psychology\\n• Understand the merits of an education in psychology\\nWhat is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology\\nexplores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists\\nuse the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question\\nabout how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the\\nphenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or\\ngroup of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over\\ntime. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes\\nobservations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then\\npublished or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.\\nScientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because\\nit is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We\\nmust ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However,\\nwe can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus,\\npsychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.\\nIn general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot\\narrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the\\nmind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific\\nmethod is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on\\nobservation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or\\nprevious authorities.\\nIt was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this\\ntime, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is,\\nat its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological\\norganism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore,\\npsychology is also a social science.\\nWHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?\\nOften, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to\\nlearn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course\\nbecause it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as\\nnursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare\\npsychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses\\nacross the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology\\nmajors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook’s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality\\nand political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About\\n6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S.\\nDepartment of Education, 2016).\\n8 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nAn education in psychology is valuable for a number of reasons. Psychology students hone critical thinking\\nskills and are trained in the use of the scientific method. Critical thinking is the active application of a set of\\nskills to information for the understanding and evaluation of that information. The evaluation of\\ninformation—assessing its reliability and usefulness— is an important skill in a world full of competing “facts,”\\nmany of which are designed to be misleading. For example, critical thinking involves maintaining an attitude\\nof skepticism, recognizing internal biases, making use of logical thinking, asking appropriate questions, and\\nmaking observations. Psychology students also can develop better communication skills during the course of\\ntheir undergraduate coursework (American Psychological Association, 2011). Together, these factors increase\\nstudents’ scientific literacy and prepare students to critically evaluate the various sources of information they\\nencounter.\\nIn addition to these broad-based skills, psychology students come to understand the complex factors that\\nshape one’s behavior. They appreciate the interaction of our biology, our environment, and our experiences in\\ndetermining who we are and how we will behave. They learn about basic principles that guide how we think\\nand behave, and they come to recognize the tremendous diversity that exists across individuals and across\\ncultural boundaries (American Psychological Association, 2011).\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nWatch a brief video about some questions to consider before deciding to major in psychology\\n(http://openstax.org/l/psycmajor) to learn more.\\n1.2 History of Psychology\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Understand the importance of Wundt and James in the development of psychology\\n• Appreciate Freud’s influence on psychology\\n• Understand the basic tenets of Gestalt psychology\\n• Appreciate the important role that behaviorism played in psychology’s history\\n• Understand basic tenets of humanism\\n• Understand how the cognitive revolution shifted psychology’s focus back to the mind\\nPsychology is a relatively young science with its experimental roots in the 19th century, compared, for\\nexample, to human physiology, which dates much earlier. As mentioned, anyone interested in exploring issues\\nrelated to the mind generally did so in a philosophical context prior to the 19th century. Two 19th century\\nscholars, Wilhelm Wundt and William James, are generally credited as being the founders of psychology as a\\nscience and academic discipline that was distinct from philosophy. This section will provide an overview of the\\nshifts in paradigms that have influenced psychology from Wundt and James through today.\\nWundt and Structuralism\\nWilhelm Wundt (1832–1920) was a German scientist who was the first person to be referred to as a\\npsychologist. His famous book entitled Principles of Physiological Psychology was published in 1873. Wundt\\nviewed psychology as a scientific study of conscious experience, and he believed that the goal of psychology\\nwas to identify components of consciousness and how those components combined to result in our conscious\\nexperience. Wundt used introspection (he called it “internal perception”), a process by which someone\\nexamines their own conscious experience as objectively as possible, making the human mind like any other\\naspect of nature that a scientist observed. He believed in the notion of voluntarism—that people have free will\\nand should know the intentions of a psychological experiment if they were participating (Danziger, 1980).\\nWundt considered his version experimental introspection; he used instruments such as those that measured\\nreaction time. He also wrote Volkerpsychologie in 1904 in which he suggested that psychology should include\\nthe study of culture, as it involves the study of people. Edward Titchener, one of his students, went on to\\n1.2 • History of Psychology 9\\ndevelop structuralism. Its focus was on the contents of mental processes rather than their function (Pickren &\\nRutherford, 2010). Wundt established his psychology laboratory at the University at Leipzig in 1879 (Figure\\n1.2). In this laboratory, Wundt and his students conducted experiments on, for example, reaction times. A\\nsubject, sometimes in a room isolated from the scientist, would receive a stimulus such as a light, image, or\\nsound. The subject’s reaction to the stimulus would be to push a button, and an apparatus would record the\\ntime to reaction. Wundt could measure reaction time to one-thousandth of a second (Nicolas & Ferrand, 1999).\\nFIGURE 1.2 (a) Wilhelm Wundt is credited as one of the founders of psychology. He created the first laboratory for\\npsychological research. (b) This photo shows him seated and surrounded by fellow researchers and equipment in\\nhis laboratory in Germany.\\nHowever, despite his efforts to train individuals in the process of introspection, this process remained highly\\nsubjective, and there was very little agreement between individuals.\\nFunctionalism\\nWilliam James, John Dewey, and Charles Sanders Peirce helped establish functional psychology (Figure 1.3).\\nThey accepted Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection and viewed this theory as an explanation of an\\norganism’s characteristics. Key to that theory is the idea that natural selection leads to organisms that are\\nadapted to their environment, including their behavior. Adaptation means that a trait of an organism has a\\nfunction for the survival and reproduction of the individual, because it has been naturally selected. As James\\nsaw it, psychology’s purpose was to study the function of behavior in the world, and as such, his perspective\\nwas known as functionalism. Functionalism focused on how mental activities helped an organism fit into its\\nenvironment. Functionalism has a second, more subtle meaning in that functionalists were more interested in\\nthe operation of the whole mind rather than of its individual parts, which were the focus of structuralism. Like\\nWundt, James believed that introspection could serve as one means by which someone might study mental\\nactivities, but James also relied on more objective measures, including the use of various recording devices,\\nand examinations of concrete products of mental activities and of anatomy and physiology (Gordon, 1995).\\n10 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nUse of Research Information\\nTrying to determine which theories are and are not accepted by the scientific community can be difficult,\\nespecially in an area of research as broad as psychology. More than ever before, we have an incredible amount\\nof information at our fingertips, and a simple internet search on any given research topic might result in a\\nnumber of contradictory studies. In these cases, we are witnessing the scientific community going through the\\nprocess of reaching a consensus, and it could be quite some time before a consensus emerges. For example,\\nthe explosion in our use of technology has led researchers to question whether this ultimately helps or hinders\\nus. The use and implementation of technology in educational settings has become widespread over the last few\\ndecades. Researchers are coming to different conclusions regarding the use of technology. To illustrate this\\npoint, a study investigating a smartphone app targeting surgery residents (graduate students in surgery\\ntraining) found that the use of this app can increase student engagement and raise test scores (Shaw & Tan,\\n2015). Conversely, another study found that the use of technology in undergraduate student populations had\\nnegative impacts on sleep, communication, and time management skills (Massimini & Peterson, 2009). Until\\nsufficient amounts of research have been conducted, there will be no clear consensus on the effects that\\ntechnology has on a student\\'s acquisition of knowledge, study skills, and mental health.\\nIn the meantime, we should strive to think critically about the information we encounter by exercising a degree\\nof healthy skepticism. When someone makes a claim, we should examine the claim from a number of different\\nperspectives: what is the expertise of the person making the claim, what might they gain if the claim is valid,\\ndoes the claim seem justified given the evidence, and what do other researchers think of the claim? This is\\nespecially important when we consider how much information in advertising campaigns and on the internet\\nclaims to be based on “scientific evidence” when in actuality it is a belief or perspective of just a few\\nindividuals trying to sell a product or draw attention to their perspectives.\\nWe should be informed consumers of the information made available to us because decisions based on this\\ninformation have significant consequences. One such consequence can be seen in politics and public policy.\\nImagine that you have been elected as the governor of your state. One of your responsibilities is to manage the\\nstate budget and determine how to best spend your constituents’ tax dollars. As the new governor, you need to\\ndecide whether to continue funding early intervention programs. These programs are designed to help\\nchildren who come from low-income backgrounds, have special needs, or face other disadvantages. These\\nprograms may involve providing a wide variety of services to maximize the children\\'s development and\\nposition them for optimal levels of success in school and later in life (Blann, 2005). While such programs\\nsound appealing, you would want to be sure that they also proved effective before investing additional money\\nin these programs. Fortunately, psychologists and other scientists have conducted vast amounts of research on\\nsuch programs and, in general, the programs are found to be effective (Neil & Christensen, 2009; Peters-\\nScheffer, Didden, Korzilius, & Sturmey, 2011). While not all programs are equally effective, and the short-term\\neffects of many such programs are more pronounced, there is reason to believe that many of these programs\\nproduce long-term benefits for participants (Barnett, 2011). If you are committed to being a good steward of\\ntaxpayer money, you would want to look at research. Which programs are most effective? What characteristics\\nof these programs make them effective? Which programs promote the best outcomes? After examining the\\nresearch, you would be best equipped to make decisions about which programs to fund.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nWatch this video about early childhood program effectiveness (http://openstax.org/l/programeffect) to learn\\nhow scientists evaluate effectiveness and how best to invest money into programs that are most effective.\\nUltimately, it is not just politicians who can benefit from using research in guiding their decisions. We all might\\nlook to research from time to time when making decisions in our lives. Imagine you just found out that your\\nsister Maria\\'s child, Umberto, was recently diagnosed with autism. There are many treatments for autism that\\nhelp decrease the negative impact of autism on the individual. Some examples of treatments for autism are\\n2.1 • Why Is Research Important? 37\\napplied behavior analysis (ABA), social communication groups, social skills groups, occupational therapy, and\\neven medication options. If Maria asked you for advice or guidance, what would you do? You would likely want\\nto review the research and learn about the efficacy of each treatment so you could best advise your sister.\\nIn the end, research is what makes the difference between facts and opinions. Facts are observable realities,\\nand opinions are personal judgments, conclusions, or attitudes that may or may not be accurate. In the\\nscientific community, facts can be established only using evidence collected through empirical research.\\nNOTABLE RESEARCHERS\\nPsychological research has a long history involving important figures from diverse backgrounds. While the\\nintroductory chapter discussed several researchers who made significant contributions to the discipline, there\\nare many more individuals who deserve attention in considering how psychology has advanced as a science\\nthrough their work (Figure 2.3). For instance, Margaret Floy Washburn (1871–1939) was the first woman to\\nearn a PhD in psychology. Her research focused on animal behavior and cognition (Margaret Floy Washburn,\\nPhD, n.d.). Mary Whiton Calkins (1863–1930) was a preeminent first-generation American psychologist who\\nopposed the behaviorist movement, conducted significant research into memory, and established one of the\\nearliest experimental psychology labs in the United States (Mary Whiton Calkins, n.d.).\\nFrancis Sumner (1895–1954) was the first African American to receive a PhD in psychology in 1920. His\\ndissertation focused on issues related to psychoanalysis. Sumner also had research interests in racial bias and\\neducational justice. Sumner was one of the founders of Howard University’s department of psychology, and\\nbecause of his accomplishments, he is sometimes referred to as the “Father of Black Psychology.” Thirteen\\nyears later, Inez Beverly Prosser (1895–1934) became the first African American woman to receive a PhD in\\npsychology. Prosser’s research highlighted issues related to education in segregated versus integrated schools,\\nand ultimately, her work was very influential in the hallmark Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court\\nruling that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional (Ethnicity and Health in America Series:\\nFeatured Psychologists, n.d.).\\nFIGURE 2.3 (a) Margaret Floy Washburn was the first woman to earn a doctorate degree in psychology. (b) The\\noutcome of Brown v. Board of Education was influenced by the research of psychologist Inez Beverly Prosser, who\\nwas the first African American woman to earn a PhD in psychology.\\nAlthough the establishment of psychology’s scientific roots occurred first in Europe and the United States, it\\ndid not take much time until researchers from around the world began to establish their own laboratories and\\nresearch programs. For example, some of the first experimental psychology laboratories in South America\\nwere founded by Horatio Piñero (1869–1919) at two institutions in Buenos Aires, Argentina (Godoy & Brussino,\\n2010). In India, Gunamudian David Boaz (1908–1965) and Narendra Nath Sen Gupta (1889–1944) established\\n38 2 • Psychological Research\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nthe first independent departments of psychology at the University of Madras and the University of Calcutta,\\nrespectively. These developments provided an opportunity for Indian researchers to make important\\ncontributions to the field (Gunamudian David Boaz, n.d.; Narendra Nath Sen Gupta, n.d.).\\nWhen the American Psychological Association (APA) was first founded in 1892, all of the members were White\\nmales (Women and Minorities in Psychology, n.d.). However, by 1905, Mary Whiton Calkins was elected as the\\nfirst female president of the APA, and by 1946, nearly one-quarter of American psychologists were female.\\nPsychology became a popular degree option for students enrolled in the nation’s historically Black higher\\neducation institutions, increasing the number of Black Americans who went on to become psychologists. Given\\ndemographic shifts occurring in the United States and increased access to higher educational opportunities\\namong historically underrepresented populations, there is reason to hope that the diversity of the field will\\nincreasingly match the larger population, and that the research contributions made by the psychologists of the\\nfuture will better serve people of all backgrounds (Women and Minorities in Psychology, n.d.).\\nThe Process of Scientific Research\\nScientific knowledge is advanced through a process known as the scientific method. Basically, ideas (in the\\nform of theories and hypotheses) are tested against the real world (in the form of empirical observations), and\\nthose empirical observations lead to more ideas that are tested against the real world, and so on. In this sense,\\nthe scientific process is circular. The types of reasoning within the circle are called deductive and inductive. In\\ndeductive reasoning, ideas are tested in the real world; in inductive reasoning, real-world observations lead\\nto new ideas (Figure 2.4). These processes are inseparable, like inhaling and exhaling, but different research\\napproaches place different emphasis on the deductive and inductive aspects.\\nFIGURE 2.4 Psychological research relies on both inductive and deductive reasoning.\\nIn the scientific context, deductive reasoning begins with a generalization—one hypothesis—that is then used\\nto reach logical conclusions about the real world. If the hypothesis is correct, then the logical conclusions\\nreached through deductive reasoning should also be correct. A deductive reasoning argument might go\\nsomething like this: All living things require energy to survive (this would be your hypothesis). Ducks are living\\nthings. Therefore, ducks require energy to survive (logical conclusion). In this example, the hypothesis is\\ncorrect; therefore, the conclusion is correct as well. Sometimes, however, an incorrect hypothesis may lead to a\\nlogical but incorrect conclusion. Consider this argument: all ducks are born with the ability to see. Quackers is\\na duck. Therefore, Quackers was born with the ability to see. Scientists use deductive reasoning to empirically\\ntest their hypotheses. Returning to the example of the ducks, researchers might design a study to test the\\nhypothesis that if all living things require energy to survive, then ducks will be found to require energy to\\nsurvive.\\nDeductive reasoning starts with a generalization that is tested against real-world observations; however,\\ninductive reasoning moves in the opposite direction. Inductive reasoning uses empirical observations to\\n2.1 • Why Is Research Important? 39\\nconstruct broad generalizations. Unlike deductive reasoning, conclusions drawn from inductive reasoning\\nmay or may not be correct, regardless of the observations on which they are based. For instance, you may\\nnotice that your favorite fruits—apples, bananas, and oranges—all grow on trees; therefore, you assume that all\\nfruit must grow on trees. This would be an example of inductive reasoning, and, clearly, the existence of\\nstrawberries, blueberries, and kiwi demonstrate that this generalization is not correct despite it being based\\non a number of direct observations. Scientists use inductive reasoning to formulate theories, which in turn\\ngenerate hypotheses that are tested with deductive reasoning. In the end, science involves both deductive and\\ninductive processes.\\nFor example, case studies, which you will read about in the next section, are heavily weighted on the side of\\nempirical observations. Thus, case studies are closely associated with inductive processes as researchers\\ngather massive amounts of observations and seek interesting patterns (new ideas) in the data. Experimental\\nresearch, on the other hand, puts great emphasis on deductive reasoning.\\nWe’ve stated that theories and hypotheses are ideas, but what sort of ideas are they, exactly? A theory is a well-\\ndeveloped set of ideas that propose an explanation for observed phenomena. Theories are repeatedly checked\\nagainst the world, but they tend to be too complex to be tested all at once; instead, researchers create\\nhypotheses to test specific aspects of a theory.\\nA hypothesis is a testable prediction about how the world will behave if our idea is correct, and it is often\\nworded as an if-then statement (e.g., if I study all night, I will get a passing grade on the test). The hypothesis is\\nextremely important because it bridges the gap between the realm of ideas and the real world. As specific\\nhypotheses are tested, theories are modified and refined to reflect and incorporate the result of these tests\\nFigure 2.5.\\nFIGURE 2.5 The scientific method involves deriving hypotheses from theories and then testing those hypotheses. If\\nthe results are consistent with the theory, then the theory is supported. If the results are not consistent, then the\\ntheory should be modified and new hypotheses will be generated.\\nTo see how this process works, let’s consider a specific theory and a hypothesis that might be generated from\\nthat theory. As you’ll learn in a later chapter, the James-Lange theory of emotion asserts that emotional\\nexperience relies on the physiological arousal associated with the emotional state. If you walked out of your\\nhome and discovered a very aggressive snake waiting on your doorstep, your heart would begin to race and\\nyour stomach churn. According to the James-Lange theory, these physiological changes would result in your\\n40 2 • Psychological Research\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nfeeling of fear. A hypothesis that could be derived from this theory might be that a person who is unaware of\\nthe physiological arousal that the sight of the snake elicits will not feel fear.\\nA scientific hypothesis is also falsifiable, or capable of being shown to be incorrect. Recall from the\\nintroductory chapter that Sigmund Freud had lots of interesting ideas to explain various human behaviors\\n(Figure 2.6). However, a major criticism of Freud’s theories is that many of his ideas are not falsifiable; for\\nexample, it is impossible to imagine empirical observations that would disprove the existence of the id, the\\nego, and the superego—the three elements of personality described in Freud’s theories. Despite this, Freud’s\\ntheories are widely taught in introductory psychology texts because of their historical significance for\\npersonality psychology and psychotherapy, and these remain the root of all modern forms of therapy.\\nFIGURE 2.6 Many of the specifics of (a) Freud\\'s theories, such as (b) his division of the mind into id, ego, and\\nsuperego, have fallen out of favor in recent decades because they are not falsifiable. In broader strokes, his views\\nset the stage for much of psychological thinking today, such as the unconscious nature of the majority of\\npsychological processes.\\nIn contrast, the James-Lange theory does generate falsifiable hypotheses, such as the one described above.\\nSome individuals who suffer significant injuries to their spinal columns are unable to feel the bodily changes\\nthat often accompany emotional experiences. Therefore, we could test the hypothesis by determining how\\nemotional experiences differ between individuals who have the ability to detect these changes in their\\nphysiological arousal and those who do not. In fact, this research has been conducted and while the emotional\\nexperiences of people deprived of an awareness of their physiological arousal may be less intense, they still\\nexperience emotion (Chwalisz, Diener, & Gallagher, 1988).\\nScientific research’s dependence on falsifiability allows for great confidence in the information that it\\nproduces. Typically, by the time information is accepted by the scientific community, it has been tested\\nrepeatedly.\\n2.2 Approaches to Research\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Describe the different research methods used by psychologists\\n• Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of case studies, naturalistic observation, surveys, and archival research\\n• Compare longitudinal and cross-sectional approaches to research\\n• Compare and contrast correlation and causation\\nThere are many research methods available to psychologists in their efforts to understand, describe, and\\n2.2 • Approaches to Research 41\\nexplain behavior and the cognitive and biological processes that underlie it. Some methods rely on\\nobservational techniques. Other approaches involve interactions between the researcher and the individuals\\nwho are being studied—ranging from a series of simple questions to extensive, in-depth interviews—to well-\\ncontrolled experiments.\\nEach of these research methods has unique strengths and weaknesses, and each method may only be\\nappropriate for certain types of research questions. For example, studies that rely primarily on observation\\nproduce incredible amounts of information, but the ability to apply this information to the larger population is\\nsomewhat limited because of small sample sizes. Survey research, on the other hand, allows researchers to\\neasily collect data from relatively large samples. While this allows for results to be generalized to the larger\\npopulation more easily, the information that can be collected on any given survey is somewhat limited and\\nsubject to problems associated with any type of self-reported data. Some researchers conduct archival\\nresearch by using existing records. While this can be a fairly inexpensive way to collect data that can provide\\ninsight into a number of research questions, researchers using this approach have no control on how or what\\nkind of data was collected. All of the methods described thus far are correlational in nature. This means that\\nresearchers can speak to important relationships that might exist between two or more variables of interest.\\nHowever, correlational data cannot be used to make claims about cause-and-effect relationships.\\nCorrelational research can find a relationship between two variables, but the only way a researcher can claim\\nthat the relationship between the variables is cause and effect is to perform an experiment. In experimental\\nresearch, which will be discussed later in this chapter, there is a tremendous amount of control over variables\\nof interest. While this is a powerful approach, experiments are often conducted in artificial settings. This calls\\ninto question the validity of experimental findings with regard to how they would apply in real-world settings.\\nIn addition, many of the questions that psychologists would like to answer cannot be pursued through\\nexperimental research because of ethical concerns.\\nClinical or Case Studies\\nIn 2011, the New York Times published a feature story on Krista and Tatiana Hogan, Canadian twin girls.\\nThese particular twins are unique because Krista and Tatiana are conjoined twins, connected at the head.\\nThere is evidence that the two girls are connected in a part of the brain called the thalamus, which is a major\\nsensory relay center. Most incoming sensory information is sent through the thalamus before reaching higher\\nregions of the cerebral cortex for processing.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nWatch this CBC video about Krista\\'s and Tatiana\\'s lives (http://openstax.org/l/hogans) to learn more.\\nThe implications of this potential connection mean that it might be possible for one twin to experience the\\nsensations of the other twin. For instance, if Krista is watching a particularly funny television program, Tatiana\\nmight smile or laugh even if she is not watching the program. This particular possibility has piqued the\\ninterest of many neuroscientists who seek to understand how the brain uses sensory information.\\nThese twins represent an enormous resource in the study of the brain, and since their condition is very rare, it\\nis likely that as long as their family agrees, scientists will follow these girls very closely throughout their lives to\\ngain as much information as possible (Dominus, 2011).\\nOver time, it has become clear that while Krista and Tatiana share some sensory experiences and motor\\ncontrol, they remain two distinct individuals, which provides invaluable insight for researchers interested in\\nthe mind and the brain (Egnor, 2017).\\nIn observational research, scientists are conducting a clinical or case study when they focus on one person or\\njust a few individuals. Indeed, some scientists spend their entire careers studying just 10–20 individuals. Why\\nwould they do this? Obviously, when they focus their attention on a very small number of people, they can gain\\n42 2 • Psychological Research\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\n', 'answer': 'Answer VERY concisely from the provided context only.

In this chapter, we will explore what psychology is, what it is not, and how it has evolved over time. We will also look at some common misconceptions about psychology. Finally, we will discuss some careers in psychology and the role that psychology plays in our lives. 2. WHAT IS PSYCHOLOGY? The word “psychology” comes from two Greek words, “psyche” and “logos,” which mean “mind” or “thinking.” Psychologists are interested in how the mind works and how we think and feel. They study the mental processes that occur in the brain, such as perception, attention, memory, thinking, problem solving, emotion, motivation, learning, decision making, self-regulation, personality, social behavior, etc. Psychologists use a variety of methods to study these processes, including observation, experiments, surveys, interviews, questionnaires, brain imaging, neuropsychology, cognitive neuroscience, psychometrics, clinical psychology, developmental psychology, ethnopsychology and social psychology. Psychology has a long and rich history. It has been practiced for thousands of years in many different cultures and societies. For example, in ancient Greece, Plato and Aristotle studied psychology in order to understand the nature of human beings and their relationships with each other and with their environment. In the Middle Ages, Christian theologians and philosophers used psychology as a tool for understanding the nature of God and his relationship with his creatures. During the Renaissance, scientists and thinkers such as Galileo Galilei, Isaac Newton, René Descartes, John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Auguste Comte, Jean-Paul Sartre, Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, William James, Edward Thorndike, B.F. Skinner and others developed theories of psychology that continue to shape our understanding of this field today. Today, psychology is a broad and diverse field that encompasses a wide range of subfields and disciplines. Some of these disciplines include: • Clinical psychology: This field focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders, as well as', 'references': '{\"sections\": [\"Psychological Research/Analyzing Findings\", \"Introduction to Psychology/Contemporary Psychology\"], \"pages\": [\"51\", \"52\", \"20\"]}'}\n",

While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember\\nwhat he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is\\nassociated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend’s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John\\nNash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would\\ntell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended\\nfor him. He also began to hear voices and became suspicious of the people around him. Soon thereafter, Nash\\nwas diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a state-run mental institution (O’Connor & Robertson,\\n1Introduction to Psychology\\n2002). Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these\\nexperiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain’s internal\\nprocesses and people’s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of\\npsychology has explored these questions.\\n1.1 What Is Psychology?\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Define psychology\\n• Understand the merits of an education in psychology\\nWhat is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology\\nexplores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists\\nuse the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question\\nabout how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the\\nphenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or\\ngroup of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over\\ntime. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes\\nobservations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then\\npublished or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.\\nScientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because\\nit is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We\\nmust ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However,\\nwe can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus,\\npsychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.\\nIn general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot\\narrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the\\nmind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific\\nmethod is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on\\nobservation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or\\nprevious authorities.\\nIt was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this\\ntime, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is,\\nat its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological\\norganism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore,\\npsychology is also a social science.\\nWHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?\\nOften, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to\\nlearn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course\\nbecause it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as\\nnursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare\\npsychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses\\nacross the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology\\nmajors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook’s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality\\nand political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About\\n6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S.\\nDepartment of Education, 2016).\\n8 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nAn education in psychology is valuable for a number of reasons. Psychology students hone critical thinking\\nskills and are trained in the use of the scientific method. Critical thinking is the active application of a set of\\nskills to information for the understanding and evaluation of that information. The evaluation of\\ninformation—assessing its reliability and usefulness— is an important skill in a world full of competing “facts,”\\nmany of which are designed to be misleading. For example, critical thinking involves maintaining an attitude\\nof skepticism, recognizing internal biases, making use of logical thinking, asking appropriate questions, and\\nmaking observations. Psychology students also can develop better communication skills during the course of\\ntheir undergraduate coursework (American Psychological Association, 2011). Together, these factors increase\\nstudents’ scientific literacy and prepare students to critically evaluate the various sources of information they\\nencounter.\\nIn addition to these broad-based skills, psychology students come to understand the complex factors that\\nshape one’s behavior. They appreciate the interaction of our biology, our environment, and our experiences in\\ndetermining who we are and how we will behave. They learn about basic principles that guide how we think\\nand behave, and they come to recognize the tremendous diversity that exists across individuals and across\\ncultural boundaries (American Psychological Association, 2011).\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nWatch a brief video about some questions to consider before deciding to major in psychology\\n(http://openstax.org/l/psycmajor) to learn more.\\n1.2 History of Psychology\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Understand the importance of Wundt and James in the development of psychology\\n• Appreciate Freud’s influence on psychology\\n• Understand the basic tenets of Gestalt psychology\\n• Appreciate the important role that behaviorism played in psychology’s history\\n• Understand basic tenets of humanism\\n• Understand how the cognitive revolution shifted psychology’s focus back to the mind\\nPsychology is a relatively young science with its experimental roots in the 19th century, compared, for\\nexample, to human physiology, which dates much earlier. As mentioned, anyone interested in exploring issues\\nrelated to the mind generally did so in a philosophical context prior to the 19th century. Two 19th century\\nscholars, Wilhelm Wundt and William James, are generally credited as being the founders of psychology as a\\nscience and academic discipline that was distinct from philosophy. This section will provide an overview of the\\nshifts in paradigms that have influenced psychology from Wundt and James through today.\\nWundt and Structuralism\\nWilhelm Wundt (1832–1920) was a German scientist who was the first person to be referred to as a\\npsychologist. His famous book entitled Principles of Physiological Psychology was published in 1873. Wundt\\nviewed psychology as a scientific study of conscious experience, and he believed that the goal of psychology\\nwas to identify components of consciousness and how those components combined to result in our conscious\\nexperience. Wundt used introspection (he called it “internal perception”), a process by which someone\\nexamines their own conscious experience as objectively as possible, making the human mind like any other\\naspect of nature that a scientist observed. He believed in the notion of voluntarism—that people have free will\\nand should know the intentions of a psychological experiment if they were participating (Danziger, 1980).\\nWundt considered his version experimental introspection; he used instruments such as those that measured\\nreaction time. He also wrote Volkerpsychologie in 1904 in which he suggested that psychology should include\\nthe study of culture, as it involves the study of people. Edward Titchener, one of his students, went on to\\n1.2 • History of Psychology 9\\ndevelop structuralism. Its focus was on the contents of mental processes rather than their function (Pickren &\\nRutherford, 2010). Wundt established his psychology laboratory at the University at Leipzig in 1879 (Figure\\n1.2). In this laboratory, Wundt and his students conducted experiments on, for example, reaction times. A\\nsubject, sometimes in a room isolated from the scientist, would receive a stimulus such as a light, image, or\\nsound. The subject’s reaction to the stimulus would be to push a button, and an apparatus would record the\\ntime to reaction. Wundt could measure reaction time to one-thousandth of a second (Nicolas & Ferrand, 1999).\\nFIGURE 1.2 (a) Wilhelm Wundt is credited as one of the founders of psychology. He created the first laboratory for\\npsychological research. (b) This photo shows him seated and surrounded by fellow researchers and equipment in\\nhis laboratory in Germany.\\nHowever, despite his efforts to train individuals in the process of introspection, this process remained highly\\nsubjective, and there was very little agreement between individuals.\\nFunctionalism\\nWilliam James, John Dewey, and Charles Sanders Peirce helped establish functional psychology (Figure 1.3).\\nThey accepted Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection and viewed this theory as an explanation of an\\norganism’s characteristics. Key to that theory is the idea that natural selection leads to organisms that are\\nadapted to their environment, including their behavior. Adaptation means that a trait of an organism has a\\nfunction for the survival and reproduction of the individual, because it has been naturally selected. As James\\nsaw it, psychology’s purpose was to study the function of behavior in the world, and as such, his perspective\\nwas known as functionalism. Functionalism focused on how mental activities helped an organism fit into its\\nenvironment. Functionalism has a second, more subtle meaning in that functionalists were more interested in\\nthe operation of the whole mind rather than of its individual parts, which were the focus of structuralism. Like\\nWundt, James believed that introspection could serve as one means by which someone might study mental\\nactivities, but James also relied on more objective measures, including the use of various recording devices,\\nand examinations of concrete products of mental activities and of anatomy and physiology (Gordon, 1995).\\n10 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nFIGURE 1.3 William James, shown here in a self-portrait, was the first American psychologist.\\nFreud and Psychoanalytic Theory\\nPerhaps one of the most influential and well-known figures in psychology’s history was Sigmund Freud (Figure\\n1.4). Freud (1856–1939) was an Austrian neurologist who was fascinated by patients suffering from “hysteria”\\nand neurosis. Hysteria was an ancient diagnosis for disorders, primarily of women with a wide variety of\\nsymptoms, including physical symptoms and emotional disturbances, none of which had an apparent physical\\ncause. Freud theorized that many of his patients’ problems arose from the unconscious mind. In Freud’s view,\\nthe unconscious mind was a repository of feelings and urges of which we have no awareness. Gaining access to\\nthe unconscious, then, was crucial to the successful resolution of the patient’s problems. According to Freud,\\nthe unconscious mind could be accessed through dream analysis, by examinations of the first words that came\\nto people’s minds, and through seemingly innocent slips of the tongue. Psychoanalytic theory focuses on the\\nrole of a person’s unconscious, as well as early childhood experiences, and this particular perspective\\ndominated clinical psychology for several decades (Thorne & Henley, 2005).\\nFIGURE 1.4 (a) Sigmund Freud was a highly influential figure in the history of psychology. (b) One of his many\\nbooks, A General Introduction to Psychoanalysis, shared his ideas about psychoanalytical therapy; it was published\\nin 1922.\\nFreud’s ideas were influential, and you will learn more about them when you study lifespan development,\\npersonality, and therapy. For instance, many therapists believe strongly in the unconscious and the impact of\\n1.2 • History of Psychology 11\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nView a brief video of Carl Rogers describing his therapeutic approach (http://openstax.org/l/crogers1) to learn\\nmore.\\nThe Cognitive Revolution\\nBehaviorism’s emphasis on objectivity and focus on external behavior had pulled psychologists’ attention away\\nfrom the mind for a prolonged period of time. The early work of the humanistic psychologists redirected\\nattention to the individual human as a whole, and as a conscious and self-aware being. By the 1950s, new\\ndisciplinary perspectives in linguistics, neuroscience, and computer science were emerging, and these areas\\nrevived interest in the mind as a focus of scientific inquiry. This particular perspective has come to be known\\nas the cognitive revolution (Miller, 2003). By 1967, Ulric Neisser published the first textbook entitled Cognitive\\nPsychology, which served as a core text in cognitive psychology courses around the country (Thorne & Henley,\\n2005).\\nAlthough no one person is entirely responsible for starting the cognitive revolution, Noam Chomsky was very\\ninfluential in the early days of this movement (Figure 1.9). Chomsky (1928–), an American linguist, was\\ndissatisfied with the influence that behaviorism had had on psychology. He believed that psychology’s focus on\\nbehavior was short-sighted and that the field had to re-incorporate mental functioning into its purview if it\\nwere to offer any meaningful contributions to understanding behavior (Miller, 2003).\\nFIGURE 1.9 Noam Chomsky was very influential in beginning the cognitive revolution. In 2010, this mural honoring\\nhim was put up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (credit: Robert Moran)\\nEuropean psychology had never really been as influenced by behaviorism as had American psychology; and\\nthus, the cognitive revolution helped reestablish lines of communication between European psychologists and\\ntheir American counterparts. Furthermore, psychologists began to cooperate with scientists in other fields,\\nlike anthropology, linguistics, computer science, and neuroscience, among others. This interdisciplinary\\napproach often was referred to as the cognitive sciences, and the influence and prominence of this particular\\nperspective resonates in modern-day psychology (Miller, 2003).\\nFeminist Psychology\\nThe science of psychology has had an impact on human wellbeing, both positive and negative. The dominant\\ninfluence of Western, White, and male academics in the early history of psychology meant that psychology\\ndeveloped with the biases inherent in those individuals, which often had negative consequences for members of\\nsociety who were not White or male. Women, members of ethnic minorities in both the United States and other\\ncountries, and individuals with sexual orientations other than straight had difficulties entering the field of\\npsychology and therefore influencing its development. They also suffered from the attitudes of White male\\npsychologists who were not immune to the nonscientific attitudes prevalent in the society in which they\\nDIG DEEPER\\n16 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\ndeveloped and worked. Until the 1960s, the science of psychology was largely a “womanless” psychology\\n(Crawford & Marecek, 1989), meaning that few women were able to practice psychology, so they had little\\ninfluence on what was studied. In addition, the experimental subjects of psychology were mostly men, which\\nresulted from underlying assumptions that gender had no influence on psychology and that women were not of\\nsufficient interest to study.\\nAn article by Naomi Weisstein, first published in 1968 (Weisstein, 1993), stimulated a feminist revolution in\\npsychology by presenting a critique of psychology as a science. She also specifically criticized male psychologists\\nfor constructing the psychology of women entirely out of their own cultural biases and without careful\\nexperimental tests to verify any of their characterizations of women. Weisstein used, as examples, statements by\\nprominent psychologists in the 1960s, such as this quote by Bruno Bettleheim: “We must start with the\\nrealization that, as much as women want to be good scientists or engineers, they want first and foremost to be\\nwomanly companions of men and to be mothers.” Weisstein’s critique formed the foundation for the subsequent\\ndevelopment of a feminist psychology that attempted to be free of the influence of male cultural biases on our\\nknowledge of the psychology of women.\\nCrawford & Marecek (1989) identify several feminist approaches to psychology that can be described as feminist\\npsychology. These include re-evaluating and discovering the contributions of women to the history of psychology,\\nstudying psychological gender differences, and questioning the male bias present across the practice of the\\nscientific approach to knowledge.\\nMulticultural And Cross-Cultural Psychology\\nCulture impacts individuals, groups, and society. An ongoing issue researchers are trying to correct is that\\ncertain populations have been over-studied and the results of these studies have been applied to other\\npopulations. For example, Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan discuss how WEIRD societies have been\\noverstudied and the results have been wrongly applied to non-WEIRD societies (2010). WEIRD stands for\\nwestern, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic. Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan found that there are\\nmany differences between people in the WEIRD group and people in less industrialized, less urban, and non-\\nWestern societies. These differences occur in a variety of areas, including perception, cooperation, and moral\\nreasoning. That is, people vary depending on their culture and environment. Multicultural psychologists\\ndevelop theories and conduct research with diverse populations, typically within one country. Cross-cultural\\npsychologists compare populations across countries, such as participants from the United States compared to\\nparticipants from China.\\nIn 1920, Francis Cecil Sumner was the first African American to receive a PhD in psychology in the United\\nStates. Sumner established a psychology degree program at Howard University, leading to the education of a\\nnew generation of African American psychologists (Black, Spence, and Omari, 2004). Much of the work of early\\npsychologists from diverse backgrounds was dedicated to challenging intelligence testing and promoting\\ninnovative educational methods for children. George I. Sanchez contested such testing with Mexican American\\nchildren. As a psychologist of Mexican heritage, he pointed out that the language and cultural barriers in\\ntesting were keeping children from equal opportunities (Guthrie, 1998). By 1940, he was teaching with his\\ndoctoral degree at University of Texas at Austin and challenging segregated educational practices (Romo,\\n1986).\\nTwo famous African American researchers and psychologists are Mamie Phipps Clark and her husband,\\nKenneth Clark. They are best known for their studies conducted on African American children and doll\\npreference, research that was instrumental in the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court desegregation\\ncase. The Clarks applied their research to social services and opened the first child guidance center in Harlem\\n(American Psychological Association, 2019).\\nListen to the podcast below describing the Clarks\\' research and impact on the Supreme Court decision.\\n1.2 • History of Psychology 17\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nListen to a podcast about the influence of an African American\\'s psychology research on the historic Brown v.\\nBoard of Education civil rights case (http://openstax.org/l/crogers2) to learn more.\\nThe American Psychological Association has several ethnically based organizations for professional\\npsychologists that facilitate interactions among members. Since psychologists belonging to specific ethnic\\ngroups or cultures have the most interest in studying the psychology of their communities, these organizations\\nprovide an opportunity for the growth of research on the interplay between culture and psychology.\\nWOMEN IN PSYCHOLOGY\\nAlthough rarely given credit, women have been contributing to psychology since its inception as a field of\\nstudy. In 1894, Margaret Floy Washburn was the first woman awarded the doctoral degree in psychology. She\\nwrote The Animal Mind: A Textbook of Comparative Psychology, and it was the standard in the field for over 20\\nyears. In the mid 1890s, Mary Whiton Calkins completed all requirements toward the PhD in psychology, but\\nHarvard University refused to award her that degree because she was a woman. She had been taught and\\nmentored by William James, who tried and failed to convince Harvard to award her the doctoral degree. Her\\nmemory research studied primacy and recency (Madigan & O’Hara, 1992), and she also wrote about how\\nstructuralism and functionalism both explained self-psychology (Calkins, 1906).\\nAnother influential woman, Mary Cover Jones, conducted a study she considered to be a sequel to John B.\\nWatson’s study of Little Albert (you’ll learn about this study in the chapter on Learning). Jones unconditioned\\nfear in Little Peter, who had been afraid of rabbits (Jones, 1924).\\nEthnic minority women contributing to the field of psychology include Martha Bernal and Inez Beverly Prosser;\\ntheir studies were related to education. Bernal, the first Latina to earn her doctoral degree in psychology\\n(1962) conducted much of her research with Mexican American children. Prosser was the first African\\nAmerican woman awarded the PhD in 1933 at the University of Cincinnati (Benjamin, Henry, & McMahon,\\n2005).\\n1.3 Contemporary Psychology\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Appreciate the diversity of interests and foci within psychology\\n• Understand basic interests and applications in each of the described areas of psychology\\n• Demonstrate familiarity with some of the major concepts or important figures in each of the described areas of\\npsychology\\nContemporary psychology is a diverse field that is influenced by all of the historical perspectives described in\\nthe preceding section. Reflective of the discipline’s diversity is the diversity seen within the American\\nPsychological Association (APA). The APA is a professional organization representing psychologists in the\\nUnited States. The APA is the largest organization of psychologists in the world, and its mission is to advance\\nand disseminate psychological knowledge for the betterment of people. There are 54 divisions within the APA,\\nrepresenting a wide variety of specialties that range from Societies for the Psychology of Religion and\\nSpirituality to Exercise and Sport Psychology to Behavioral Neuroscience and Comparative Psychology.\\nReflecting the diversity of the field of psychology itself, members, affiliate members, and associate members\\nspan the spectrum from students to doctoral-level psychologists, and come from a variety of places including\\neducational settings, criminal justice, hospitals, the armed forces, and industry (American Psychological\\nAssociation, 2014). G. Stanley Hall was the first president of the APA. Before he earned his doctoral degree, he\\nwas an adjunct instructor at Wilberforce University, a historically Black college/university (HBCU), while\\nserving as faculty at Antioch College. Hall went on to work under William James, earning his PhD. Eventually,\\n18 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nhe became the first president of Clark University in Massachusetts when it was founded (Pickren & Rutherford,\\n2010).\\nThe Association for Psychological Science (APS) was founded in 1988 and seeks to advance the scientific\\norientation of psychology. Its founding resulted from disagreements between members of the scientific and\\nclinical branches of psychology within the APA. The APS publishes five research journals and engages in\\neducation and advocacy with funding agencies. A significant proportion of its members are international,\\nalthough the majority is located in the United States. Other organizations provide networking and\\ncollaboration opportunities for professionals of several ethnic or racial groups working in psychology, such as\\nthe National Latina/o Psychological Association (NLPA), the Asian American Psychological Association (AAPA),\\nthe Association of Black Psychologists (ABPsi), and the Society of Indian Psychologists (SIP). Most of these\\ngroups are also dedicated to studying psychological and social issues within their specific communities.\\nThis section will provide an overview of the major subdivisions within psychology today in the order in which\\nthey are introduced throughout the remainder of this textbook.

While biological\\npsychology is a broad field, many biological psychologists want to understand how the structure and function\\nof the nervous system is related to behavior (Figure 1.10). As such, they often combine the research strategies\\nof both psychologists and physiologists to accomplish this goal (as discussed in Carlson, 2013).\\nFIGURE 1.10 Biological psychologists study how the structure and function of the nervous system generate\\nbehavior.\\nThe research interests of biological psychologists span a number of domains, including but not limited to,\\n1.3 • Contemporary Psychology 19\\nsensory and motor systems, sleep, drug use and abuse, ingestive behavior, reproductive behavior,\\nneurodevelopment, plasticity of the nervous system, and biological correlates of psychological disorders.\\nGiven the broad areas of interest falling under the purview of biological psychology, it will probably come as no\\nsurprise that individuals from all sorts of backgrounds are involved in this research, including biologists,\\nmedical professionals, physiologists, and chemists. This interdisciplinary approach is often referred to as\\nneuroscience, of which biological psychology is a component (Carlson, 2013).\\nWhile biopsychology typically focuses on the immediate causes of behavior based in the physiology of a\\nhuman or other animal, evolutionary psychology seeks to study the ultimate biological causes of behavior. To\\nthe extent that a behavior is impacted by genetics, a behavior, like any anatomical characteristic of a human or\\nanimal, will demonstrate adaption to its surroundings. These surroundings include the physical environment\\nand, since interactions between organisms can be important to survival and reproduction, the social\\nenvironment. The study of behavior in the context of evolution has its origins with Charles Darwin, the co-\\ndiscoverer of the theory of evolution by natural selection. Darwin was well aware that behaviors should be\\nadaptive and wrote books titled, The Descent of Man (1871) and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and\\nAnimals (1872), to explore this field.\\nEvolutionary psychology, and specifically, the evolutionary psychology of humans, has enjoyed a resurgence in\\nrecent decades. To be subject to evolution by natural selection, a behavior must have a significant genetic\\ncause. In general, we expect all human cultures to express a behavior if it is caused genetically, since the\\ngenetic differences among human groups are small. The approach taken by most evolutionary psychologists is\\nto predict the outcome of a behavior in a particular situation based on evolutionary theory and then to make\\nobservations, or conduct experiments, to determine whether the results match the theory. It is important to\\nrecognize that these types of studies are not strong evidence that a behavior is adaptive, since they lack\\ninformation that the behavior is in some part genetic and not entirely cultural (Endler, 1986). Demonstrating\\nthat a trait, especially in humans, is naturally selected is extraordinarily difficult; perhaps for this reason,\\nsome evolutionary psychologists are content to assume the behaviors they study have genetic determinants\\n(Confer et al., 2010).\\nOne other drawback of evolutionary psychology is that the traits that we possess now evolved under\\nenvironmental and social conditions far back in human history, and we have a poor understanding of what\\nthese conditions were. This makes predictions about what is adaptive for a behavior difficult. Behavioral traits\\nneed not be adaptive under current conditions, only under the conditions of the past when they evolved, about\\nwhich we can only hypothesize.\\nThere are many areas of human behavior for which evolution can make predictions. Examples include\\nmemory, mate choice, relationships between kin, friendship and cooperation, parenting, social organization,\\nand status (Confer et al., 2010).\\nEvolutionary psychologists have had success in finding experimental correspondence between observations\\nand expectations. In one example, in a study of mate preference differences between men and women that\\nspanned 37 cultures, Buss (1989) found that women valued earning potential factors greater than men, and\\nmen valued potential reproductive factors (youth and attractiveness) greater than women in their prospective\\nmates. In general, the predictions were in line with the predictions of evolution, although there were deviations\\nin some cultures.\\nSensation and Perception\\nScientists interested in both physiological aspects of sensory systems as well as in the psychological\\nexperience of sensory information work within the area of sensation and perception (Figure 1.11). As such,\\nsensation and perception research is also quite interdisciplinary. Imagine walking between buildings as you\\nmove from one class to another. You are inundated with sights, sounds, touch sensations, and smells. You also\\nexperience the temperature of the air around you and maintain your balance as you make your way.

While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember what he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is associated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend’s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John Nash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would tell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended for him. He also began to hear voices in his head that he could not control. When he tried to stop them, they would come back to him, and when he did not want them to, the voices would leave him (Wearing, n.d.). These are just a few of the many examples of how people experience the world around them in ways that are unpredictable and difficult to understand. In this chapter, we will explore what psychology is, what it is not, and how it has evolved over time. We will also look at some common misconceptions about psychology. Finally, we will discuss some careers in psychology and the role that psychology plays in our lives. 2. WHAT IS PSYCHOLOGY? The word “psychology” comes from two Greek words, “psyche” and “logos,” which mean “mind” or “thinking.” Psychologists are interested in how the mind works and how we think and feel. They study the mental processes that occur in the brain, such as perception, attention, memory, thinking, problem solving, emotion, motivation, learning, decision making, self-regulation, personality, social behavior, etc. Psychologists use a variety of methods to study these processes, including observation, experiments, surveys, interviews, questionnaires, brain imaging, neuropsychology, cognitive neuroscience, psychometrics, clinical psychology, developmental psychology, ethnopsychology and social psychology. Psychology has a long and rich history. It has been practiced for thousands of years in many different cultures and societies. For example, in ancient Greece, Plato and Aristotle studied psychology in order to understand the nature of human beings and their relationships with each other and with their environment. In the Middle Ages, Christian theologians and philosophers used psychology as a tool for understanding the nature of God and his relationship with his creatures. During the Renaissance, scientists and thinkers such as Galileo Galilei, Isaac Newton, René Descartes, John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Auguste Comte, Jean-Paul Sartre, Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, William James, Edward Thorndike, B.F. Skinner and others developed theories of psychology that continue to shape our understanding of this field today. Today, psychology is a broad and diverse field that encompasses a wide range of subfields and disciplines. Some of these disciplines include: • Clinical psychology: This field focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders, as well as', 'references': '{\"sections\": [\"Introduction to Psychology/Contemporary Psychology\", \"Introduction to Psychology\"], \"pages\": [\"20\", \"21\", \"30\"]}'}\n",

Aaron Alexis, 34, had a troubled history: he thought that he was\\nbeing controlled by radio waves. He called the police to complain about voices in his head and being under\\nsurveillance by “shadowy forces” (Thomas, Levine, Date, & Cloherty, 2013). While Alexis’s actions cannot be\\nexcused, it is clear that he had some form of mental illness. Mental illness is not necessarily a cause of\\nviolence; it is far more likely that the mentally ill will be victims rather than perpetrators of violence (Stuart,\\n2003). If, however, Alexis had received the help he needed, this tragedy might have been averted.\\n15Psychological Disorders\\n15.1 What Are Psychological Disorders?\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Understand the problems inherent in defining the concept of psychological disorder\\n• Describe what is meant by harmful dysfunction\\n• Identify the formal criteria that thoughts, feelings, and behaviors must meet to be considered abnormal and,\\nthus, symptomatic of a psychological disorder\\nAccording to the American Psychiatric Association, a psychological disorder, or mental disorder, is “a\\nsyndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotion regulation,\\nor behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological, or developmental processes underlying\\nmental functioning. Mental disorders are usually associated with significant distress in social, occupational, or\\nother important activities” (2013). Psychopathology is the study of psychological disorders, including their\\nsymptoms, etiology (i.e., their causes), and treatment. The term psychopathology can also refer to the\\nmanifestation of a psychological disorder. Although consensus can be difficult, it is extremely important for\\nmental health professionals to agree on what kinds of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are truly abnormal in\\nthe sense that they genuinely indicate the presence of psychopathology. Certain patterns of behavior and inner\\nexperience can easily be labeled as abnormal and clearly signify some kind of psychological disturbance. The\\nperson who washes their hands 40 times per day and the person who claims to hear the voices of demons\\nexhibit behaviors and inner experiences that most would regard as abnormal: beliefs and behaviors that\\nsuggest the existence of a psychological disorder. But, consider the nervousness a young man feels when\\ntalking to an attractive person or the loneliness and longing for home a first-year student experiences during\\nher first semester of college—these feelings may not be regularly present, but they fall in the range of normal.\\nSo, what kinds of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors represent a true psychological disorder? Psychologists work\\nto distinguish psychological disorders from inner experiences and behaviors that are merely situational,\\nidiosyncratic, or unconventional.\\nMental health issues are often incorrectly viewed as less important than physical illnesses, and sometimes\\npeople are blamed or otherwise stigmatized for their condition. People with mental illnesses did not choose or\\ncreate their illness, and cannot simply manage it through positive thinking or other attitudinal changes.\\nDiagnosis, treatment, and support are all necessary, and all must be considered with respect and sensitivity to\\nthe extremely challenging nature of mental illness. While not everyone experiencing difficulty has a\\npsychological disorder, mental health is critical to our ability to function in our relationships, education, and\\nwork. It is important that people talk with qualified professionals if they are having persistent feelings or\\nexperiences in line with the descriptions below; the discussion may or may not lead to a diagnosis, but as with\\nphysical illnesses, one has a better chance at success if they raise the issues with doctors or other experts.\\nDefinition of a Psychological Disorder\\nPerhaps the simplest approach to conceptualizing psychological disorders is to label behaviors, thoughts, and\\ninner experiences that are atypical, distressful, dysfunctional, and sometimes even dangerous, as signs of a\\ndisorder. For example, if you ask a classmate for a date and you are rejected, you probably would feel a little\\ndejected. Such feelings would be normal. If you felt extremely depressed—so much so that you lost interest in\\nactivities, had difficulty eating or sleeping, felt utterly worthless, and contemplated suicide—your feelings\\nwould be atypical, would deviate from the norm, and could signify the presence of a psychological disorder.\\nJust because something is atypical, however, does not necessarily mean it is disordered.\\nFor example, only about 4% of people in the United States have red hair, so red hair is considered an atypical\\ncharacteristic (Figure 15.2), but it is not considered disordered, it’s just unusual. And it is less unusual in\\nScotland, where approximately 13% of the population has red hair (“DNA Project Aims,” 2012). As you will\\nlearn, some disorders, although not exactly typical, are far from atypical, and the rates in which they appear in\\nthe population are surprisingly high.\\n538 15 • Psychological Disorders\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nFIGURE 15.2 Red hair is considered unusual, but not abnormal. (a) Isla Fischer, (b) Prince Harry, and (c) Marcia\\nCross are three natural redheads. (credit a: modification of work by Richard Goldschmidt; credit b: modification of\\nwork by Glyn Lowe; credit c: modification of work by Kirk Weaver)\\nIf we can agree that merely being atypical is an insufficient criterion for a having a psychological disorder, is it\\nreasonable to consider behavior or inner experiences that differ from widely expected cultural values or\\nexpectations as disordered? Using this criterion, a person who walks around a subway platform wearing a\\nheavy winter coat in July while screaming obscenities at strangers may be considered as exhibiting symptoms\\nof a psychological disorder. Their actions and clothes violate socially accepted rules governing appropriate\\ndress and behavior; these characteristics are atypical.\\nCultural Expectations\\nViolating cultural expectations is not, in and of itself, a satisfactory means of identifying the presence of a\\npsychological disorder. Since behavior varies from one culture to another, what may be expected and\\nconsidered appropriate in one culture may not be viewed as such in other cultures. For example, returning a\\nstranger’s smile is expected in the United States because a pervasive social norm dictates that we reciprocate\\nfriendly gestures. A person who refuses to acknowledge such gestures might be considered socially\\nawkward—perhaps even disordered—for violating this expectation. However, such expectations are not\\nuniversally shared. Cultural expectations in Japan involve showing reserve, restraint, and a concern for\\nmaintaining privacy around strangers. Japanese people are generally unresponsive to smiles from strangers\\n(Patterson et al., 2007). Eye contact provides another example. In the United States and Europe, eye contact\\nwith others typically signifies honesty and attention. However, most Latin-American, Asian, and African\\ncultures interpret direct eye contact as rude, confrontational, and aggressive (Pazain, 2010). Thus, someone\\nwho makes eye contact with you could be considered appropriate and respectful or brazen and offensive,\\ndepending on your culture (Figure 15.3).\\nFIGURE 15.3 Eye contact is one of many social gestures that vary from culture to culture. (credit: Joi Ito)\\nHallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not physically present) in Western societies is a violation of\\n15.1 • What Are Psychological Disorders? 539\\nto be exposed to and victims of violence than males of other races (Kilpatrick, Badour, & Resnick, 2017). A\\n2012 study found that 27% of corrections officers reported experiencing symptoms of PTSD in the past 30\\ndays. Rates were higher for males (31%) than females (22%) (Spinaris, Denhof, & Kellaway, 2012). A study\\nconducted by Jaegers et al (2019) found that 53.4% of jail correctional officers screened positively for PTSD.\\nPTSD is more prevalent in prison populations than in the general public, with prevalence estimates of 6% in\\nmale prisoners and 21% in female prisoners (Facer-Irwin et al, 2019). Factors that increase the risk of PTSD\\ninclude female gender, low socioeconomic status, low intelligence, personal history of mental disorders,\\nhistory of childhood adversity (abuse or other trauma during childhood), and family history of mental\\ndisorders (Brewin et al., 2000). Personality characteristics such as neuroticism and somatization (the tendency\\nto experience physical symptoms when one encounters stress) have been shown to elevate the risk of PTSD\\n(Bramsen, Dirkzwager, & van der Ploeg, 2000). People who experience childhood adversity and/or traumatic\\nexperiences during adulthood are at significantly higher risk of developing PTSD if they possess one or two\\nshort versions of a gene that regulates the neurotransmitter serotonin (Xie et al., 2009). This suggests a\\npossible diathesis-stress interpretation of PTSD: its development is influenced by the interaction of\\npsychosocial and biological factors.\\nSupport For Sufferers of PTSD\\nResearch has shown that social support following a traumatic event can reduce the likelihood of PTSD (Ozer,\\nBest, Lipsey, & Weiss, 2003). Social support is often defined as the comfort, advice, and assistance received\\nfrom relatives, friends, and neighbors. Social support can help individuals cope during difficult times by\\nallowing them to discuss feelings and experiences and providing a sense of being loved and appreciated. A\\n14-year study of 1,377 people who had served in the Vietnam War found that those who perceived less social\\nsupport when they came home were more likely to develop PTSD than were those who perceived greater\\nsupport (Figure 15.14). In addition, those who became involved in the community were less likely to develop\\nPTSD, and they were more likely to experience a remission of PTSD than were those who were less involved\\n(Koenen, Stellman, Stellman, & Sommer, 2003).\\nFIGURE 15.14 PTSD was first recognized in soldiers who had engaged in combat. Research has shown that strong\\n15.6 • Posttraumatic Stress Disorder 559\\nsocial support decreases the risk of PTSD. This person stands at the Vietnam Traveling Memorial Wall. (credit: Kevin\\nStanchfield)\\nLearning and the Development of PTSD\\nPTSD learning models suggest that some symptoms are developed and maintained through classical\\nconditioning. The traumatic event may act as an unconditioned stimulus that elicits an unconditioned\\nresponse characterized by extreme fear and anxiety. Cognitive, emotional, physiological, and environmental\\ncues accompanying or related to the event are conditioned stimuli. These traumatic reminders evoke\\nconditioned responses (extreme fear and anxiety) similar to those caused by the event itself (Nader, 2001). A\\nperson who witnessed or experienced a plane crash and who developed PTSD may display excessive\\nhypervigilance and distress when planes fly overhead; this behavior constitutes a conditioned response to the\\ntraumatic reminder (conditioned stimulus of the sight and sound of an airplane). Differences in how\\nconditionable individuals are help to explain differences in the development and maintenance of PTSD\\nsymptoms (Pittman, 1988). Conditioning studies demonstrate facilitated acquisition of conditioned responses\\nand delayed extinction of conditioned responses in people with PTSD (Orr et al., 2000).\\nCognitive factors are important in the development and maintenance of PTSD. One model suggests that two\\nkey processes are crucial: disturbances in memory for the event, and negative appraisals of the trauma and its\\naftermath (Ehlers & Clark, 2000). According to this theory, some people who experience traumas do not form\\ncoherent memories of the trauma; memories of the traumatic event are poorly encoded and, thus, are\\nfragmented, disorganized, and lacking in detail. Therefore, these individuals are unable remember the event\\nin a way that gives it meaning and context. A rape victim who cannot coherently remember the event may\\nremember only bits and pieces (e.g., the attacker repeating a word or insult); because the victim was unable to\\ndevelop a fully integrated memory, the fragmentary memory tends to stand out. Although unable to retrieve a\\ncomplete memory of the event, the victim may be haunted by intrusive fragments involuntarily triggered by\\nstimuli associated with the event (e.g., memories of the attacker’s comments when encountering a person who\\nresembles the attacker). This interpretation fits previously discussed material concerning PTSD and\\nconditioning. The model also proposes that negative appraisals of the event (“I deserved to be raped because\\nI’m stupid”) may lead to dysfunctional behavioral strategies (e.g., avoiding social activities where men are\\nlikely to be present) that maintain PTSD symptoms by preventing both a change in the nature of the memory\\nand a change in the problematic appraisals.\\n15.7 Mood and Related Disorders\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Distinguish normal states of sadness and euphoria from states of depression and mania\\n• Describe the symptoms of major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder\\n• Understand the differences between major depressive disorder and persistent depressive disorder, and identify\\ntwo subtypes of depression\\n• Define the criteria for a manic episode\\n• Understand genetic, biological, and psychological explanations of major depressive disorder\\n• Discuss the relationship between mood disorders and suicidal ideation, as well as factors associated with\\nsuicide\\nBlake cries all day and feeling that he is worthless and his life is hopeless, he cannot get out of bed.

All these\\nindividuals demonstrate symptoms of a potential mood disorder.\\nMood disorders (Figure 15.15) are characterized by severe disturbances in mood and emotions—most often\\n560 15 • Psychological Disorders\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\ndepression, but also mania and elation (Rothschild, 1999). All of us experience fluctuations in our moods and\\nemotional states, and often these fluctuations are caused by events in our lives. We become elated if our\\nfavorite team wins the World Series and dejected if a romantic relationship ends or if we lose our job. At times,\\nwe feel fantastic or miserable for no clear reason. People with mood disorders also experience mood\\nfluctuations, but their fluctuations are extreme, distort their outlook on life, and impair their ability to\\nfunction.\\nFIGURE 15.15 Mood disorders are characterized by massive disruptions in mood. Symptoms can range from the\\nextreme sadness and hopelessness of depression to the extreme elation and irritability of mania. (credit: Kiran\\nFoster)\\nThe DSM-5 lists two general categories of mood disorders. Depressive disorders are a group of disorders in\\nwhich depression is the main feature. Depression is a vague term that, in everyday language, refers to an\\nintense and persistent sadness. Depression is a heterogeneous mood state—it consists of a broad spectrum of\\nsymptoms that range in severity. Depressed people feel sad, discouraged, and hopeless. These individuals lose\\ninterest in activities once enjoyed, often experience a decrease in drives such as hunger and sex, and\\nfrequently doubt personal worth. Depressive disorders vary by degree, but this chapter highlights the most\\nwell-known: major depressive disorder (sometimes called unipolar depression).\\nBipolar and related disorders are a group of disorders in which mania is the defining feature. Mania is a state\\nof extreme elation and agitation. When people experience mania, they may become extremely talkative,\\nbehave recklessly, or attempt to take on many tasks simultaneously. The most recognized of these disorders is\\nbipolar disorder.\\nMajor Depressive Disorder\\nAccording to the DSM-5, the defining symptoms of major depressive disorder include “depressed mood most\\nof the day, nearly every day” (feeling sad, empty, hopeless, or appearing tearful to others), and loss of interest\\nand pleasure in usual activities (APA, 2013). In addition to feeling overwhelmingly sad most of each day,\\npeople with depression will no longer show interest or enjoyment in activities that previously were gratifying,\\nsuch as hobbies, sports, sex, social events, time spent with family, and so on. Friends and family members may\\nnotice that the person has completely abandoned previously enjoyed hobbies; for example, an avid tennis\\nplayer who develops major depressive disorder no longer plays tennis (Rothschild, 1999).\\nTo receive a diagnosis of major depressive disorder, one must experience a total of five symptoms for at least a\\ntwo-week period; these symptoms must cause significant distress or impair normal functioning, and they\\nmust not be caused by substances or a medical condition. At least one of the two symptoms mentioned above\\n15.7 • Mood and Related Disorders 561\\nmust be present, plus any combination of the following symptoms (APA, 2013):\\n• significant weight loss (when not dieting) or weight gain and/or significant decrease or increase in\\nappetite;\\n• difficulty falling asleep or sleeping too much;\\n• psychomotor agitation (the person is noticeably fidgety and jittery, demonstrated by behaviors like the\\ninability to sit, pacing, hand-wringing, pulling or rubbing of the skin, clothing, or other objects) or\\npsychomotor retardation (the person talks and moves slowly, for example, talking softly, very little, or in a\\nmonotone);\\n• fatigue or loss of energy;\\n• feelings of worthlessness or guilt;\\n• difficulty concentrating and indecisiveness; and\\n• suicidal ideation: thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), thinking about or planning suicide, or making\\nan actual suicide attempt.\\nMajor depressive disorder is considered episodic: its symptoms are typically present at their full magnitude\\nfor a certain period of time and then gradually abate. Approximately 50%–60% of people who experience an\\nepisode of major depressive disorder will have a second episode at some point in the future; those who have\\nhad two episodes have a 70% chance of having a third episode, and those who have had three episodes have a\\n90% chance of having a fourth episode (Rothschild, 1999). Although the episodes can last for months, a\\nmajority of people diagnosed with this condition (around 70%) recover within a year. However, a substantial\\nnumber do not recover; around 12% show serious signs of impairment associated with major depressive\\ndisorder after 5 years (Boland & Keller, 2009). In the long-term, many who do recover will still show minor\\nsymptoms that fluctuate in their severity (Judd, 2012).\\nResults of Major Depressive Disorder\\nMajor depressive disorder is a serious and incapacitating condition that can have a devastating effect on the\\nquality of one’s life. The person suffering from this disorder lives a profoundly miserable existence that often\\nresults in unavailability for work or education, abandonment of promising careers, and lost wages;\\noccasionally, the condition requires hospitalization. The majority of those with major depressive disorder\\nreport having faced some kind of discrimination, and many report that having received such treatment has\\nstopped them from initiating close relationships, applying for jobs for which they are qualified, and applying\\nfor education or training (Lasalvia et al., 2013). Major depressive disorder also takes a toll on health.\\nDepression is a risk factor for the development of heart disease in healthy patients, as well as adverse\\ncardiovascular outcomes in patients with preexisting heart disease (Whooley, 2006).\\nRisk Factors for Major Depressive Disorder\\nMajor depressive disorder is often referred to as the common cold of psychiatric disorders. Around 6.6% of the\\nU.S. population experiences major depressive disorder each year; 16.9% will experience the disorder during\\ntheir lifetime (Kessler & Wang, 2009). It is more common among women than among men, affecting\\napproximately 20% of women and 13% of men at some point in their life (National Comorbidity Survey, 2007).\\nThe greater risk among women is not accounted for by a tendency to report symptoms or to seek help more\\nreadily, suggesting that gender differences in the rates of major depressive disorder may reflect biological and\\ngender-related environmental experiences (Kessler, 2003).\\nLifetime rates of major depressive disorder tend to be highest in North and South America, Europe, and\\nAustralia; they are considerably lower in Asian countries (Hasin, Fenton, & Weissman, 2011). The rates of\\nmajor depressive disorder are higher among younger age cohorts than among older cohorts, perhaps because\\npeople in younger age cohorts are more willing to admit depression (Kessler & Wang, 2009).\\nA number of risk factors are associated with major depressive disorder: unemployment (including\\nhomemakers); earning less than $20,000 per year; living in urban areas; or being separated, divorced, or\\n562 15 • Psychological Disorders\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nwidowed (Hasin et al., 2011). Comorbid disorders include anxiety disorders and substance abuse disorders\\n(Kessler & Wang, 2009).\\nSubtypes of Depression\\nThe DSM-5 lists several different subtypes of depression. These subtypes—what the DSM-5 refer to as\\nspecifiers—are not specific disorders; rather, they are labels used to indicate specific patterns of symptoms or\\nto specify certain periods of time in which the symptoms may be present. One subtype, seasonal pattern,\\napplies to situations in which a person experiences the symptoms of major depressive disorder only during a\\nparticular time of year (e.g., fall or winter). In everyday language, people often refer to this subtype as the\\nwinter blues.\\nAnother subtype, peripartum onset (commonly referred to as postpartum depression), applies to women who\\nexperience major depression during pregnancy or in the four weeks following the birth of their child (APA,\\n2013). These women often feel very anxious and may even have panic attacks. They may feel guilty, agitated,\\nand be weepy. They may not want to hold or care for their newborn, even in cases in which the pregnancy was\\ndesired and intended. In extreme cases, the mother may have feelings of wanting to harm her child or herself.\\nIn a horrific illustration, a woman named Andrea Yates, who suffered from extreme peripartum-onset\\ndepression (as well as other mental illnesses), drowned her five children in a bathtub (Roche, 2002). Most\\nwomen with peripartum-onset depression do not physically harm their children, but most do have difficulty\\nbeing adequate caregivers (Fields, 2010). A surprisingly high number of women experience symptoms of\\nperipartum-onset depression. A study of 10,000 women who had recently given birth found that 14% screened\\npositive for peripartum-onset depression, and that nearly 20% reported having thoughts of wanting to harm\\nthemselves (Wisner et al., 2013).\\nPeople with persistent depressive disorder (previously known as dysthymia) experience depressed moods\\nmost of the day nearly every day for at least two years, as well as at least two of the other symptoms of major\\ndepressive disorder. People with persistent depressive disorder are chronically sad and melancholy, but do not\\nmeet all the criteria for major depression. However, episodes of full-blown major depressive disorder can\\noccur during persistent depressive disorder (APA, 2013).\\nBipolar Disorder\\nA person with bipolar disorder (commonly known as manic depression) often experiences mood states that\\nvacillate between depression and mania; that is, the person’s mood is said to alternate from one emotional\\nextreme to the other (in contrast to unipolar, which indicates a persistently sad mood).\\nTo be diagnosed with bipolar disorder, a person must have experienced a manic episode at least once in their\\nlife; although major depressive episodes are common in bipolar disorder, they are not required for a diagnosis\\n(APA, 2013). According to the DSM-5, a manic episode is characterized as a “distinct period of abnormally and\\npersistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or\\nenergy lasting at least one week,” that lasts most of the time each day (APA, 2013, p. 124). During a manic\\nepisode, some experience a mood that is almost euphoric and become excessively talkative, sometimes\\nspontaneously starting conversations with strangers; others become excessively irritable and complain or\\nmake hostile comments. The person may talk loudly and rapidly, exhibiting flight of ideas, abruptly switching\\nfrom one topic to another. These individuals are easily distracted, which can make a conversation very\\ndifficult. They may exhibit grandiosity, in which they experience inflated but unjustified self-esteem and self-\\nconfidence. For example, they might quit a job in order to “strike it rich” in the stock market, despite lacking\\nthe knowledge, experience, and capital for such an endeavor. They may take on several tasks at the same time\\n(e.g., several time-consuming projects at work) and yet show little, if any, need for sleep; some may go for days\\nwithout sleep. Patients may also recklessly engage in pleasurable activities that could have harmful\\nconsequences, including spending sprees, reckless driving, making foolish investments, excessive gambling,\\nor engaging in sexual encounters with strangers (APA, 2013).\\n15.7 • Mood and Related Disorders 563\\nFIGURE 15.20 Longitudinal studies have helped to identify risk factors for predicting violent behavior.\\nThose with antisocial tendencies do not seem to experience emotions the way most other people do. These\\nindividuals fail to show fear in response to environment cues that signal punishment, pain, or noxious\\nstimulation. For instance, they show less skin conductance (sweatiness on hands) in anticipation of electric\\nshock than do people without antisocial tendencies (Hare, 1965). Skin conductance is controlled by the\\nsympathetic nervous system and is used to assess autonomic nervous system functioning. When the\\nsympathetic nervous system is active, people become aroused and anxious, and sweat gland activity increases.\\nThus, increased sweat gland activity, as assessed through skin conductance, is taken as a sign of arousal or\\nanxiety. For those with antisocial personality disorder, a lack of skin conductance may indicate the presence of\\ncharacteristics such as emotional deficits and impulsivity that underlie the propensity for antisocial behavior\\nand negative social relationships (Fung et al., 2005).\\nAnother example showing that those with antisocial personality disorder fail to respond to environmental cues\\ncomes from a recent study by Stuppy-Sullivan and Baskin-Sommers (2019). The researchers studied cognitive\\nand reward factors associated with antisocial personality disorder dysfunction in 119 incarcerated males.\\n15.11 • Personality Disorders 587\\nEach subject was administered three tasks targeting different aspects of cognition and reward.

Although\\nchallenging, it is essential for psychologists and mental health professionals to agree on what kinds of inner\\nexperiences and behaviors constitute the presence of a psychological disorder. Inner experiences and\\nbehaviors that are atypical or violate social norms could signify the presence of a disorder; however, each of\\nthese criteria alone is inadequate. Harmful dysfunction describes the view that psychological disorders result\\nfrom the inability of an internal mechanism to perform its natural function. Many of the features of harmful\\ndysfunction conceptualization have been incorporated in the APA’s formal definition of psychological\\ndisorders. According to this definition, the presence of a psychological disorder is signaled by significant\\ndisturbances in thoughts, feelings, and behaviors; these disturbances must reflect some kind of dysfunction\\n(biological, psychological, or developmental), must cause significant impairment in one’s life, and must not\\nreflect culturally expected reactions to certain life events.\\n15.2 Diagnosing and Classifying Psychological Disorders\\nThe diagnosis and classification of psychological disorders is essential in studying and treating\\npsychopathology. The classification system used by most U.S. professionals is the DSM-5. The first edition of\\nthe DSM was published in 1952, and has undergone numerous revisions. The 5th and most recent edition, the\\nDSM-5, was published in 2013. The diagnostic manual includes a total of 237 specific diagnosable disorders,\\neach described in detail, including its symptoms, prevalence, risk factors, and comorbidity. Over time, the\\nnumber of diagnosable conditions listed in the DSM has grown steadily, prompting criticism from some.\\nNevertheless, the diagnostic criteria in the DSM are more explicit than that of any other system, which makes\\nthe DSM system highly desirable for both clinical diagnosis and research.\\n15 • Summary 591\\n\", 'answer': 'Answer VERY concisely from the provided context only.

The day before the drawing of a $300 million Powerball lottery, you notice that a line of people waiting to buy their Powerball tickets is stretched outside the door of a nearby convenience store. Based on what you’ve learned, provide some perspective on why these people are doing this, and what would likely happen if one of these individuals happened to pick the right numbers. Personal Application Questions 31. Think of a time in which you and others you know (family members, friends, and classmates) experienced an event that some viewed as threatening and others viewed as challenging. What were some of the differences in the reactions of those who experienced the event as threatening compared to those who viewed the event as challenging?

Suppose you want to design a study to examine the relationship between stress and illness, but you cannot use the Social Readjustment Rating Scale. How would you go about measuring stress? How would you measure illness? What would you need to do in order to tell if there is a cause-effect relationship between stress and illness? 33. If a family member or friend of yours has asthma, talk to that person (if they are willing) about their symptom triggers. Does this person mention stress or emotional states? If so, are there any commonalities in these asthma triggers? 34. Try to think of an example in which you coped with a particular stressor by using problem-focused coping. What was the stressor? What did your problem-focused efforts involve? Were they effective? 35. Think of an activity you participate in that you find engaging and absorbing. For example, this might be something like playing video games, reading, or a hobby. What are your experiences typically like while engaging in this activity? Do your experiences conform to the notion of flow? If so, how? Do you think that flow is important to your overall sense of well-being? Explain your answer. 36.

Psychology 2e retains its manageable scope and contains ample\\nfeatures to draw learners into the discipline.\\nStructurally, the textbook remains similar to the first edition, with no chapter reorganization and very targeted\\nchanges at the section level.\\n• Chapter 1: Introduction to Psychology\\n• Chapter 2: Psychological Research\\n• Chapter 3: Biopsychology\\n• Chapter 4: States of Consciousness\\n• Chapter 5: Sensation and Perception\\n• Chapter 6: Learning\\n• Chapter 7: Thinking and Intelligence\\n• Chapter 8: Memory\\n• Chapter 9: Lifespan Development\\n• Chapter 10: Motivation and Emotion\\n• Chapter 11: Personality\\n• Chapter 12: Social Psychology\\n• Chapter 13: Industrial-Organizational Psychology\\n• Chapter 14: Stress, Lifestyle, and Health\\n• Chapter 15: Psychological Disorders\\n• Chapter 16: Therapy and Treatment\\nChanges to the Second Edition\\nOpenStax only undertakes second editions when significant modifications to the text are necessary. In the case\\nof Psychology 2e, user feedback indicated that we needed to focus on a few key areas, which we have done in\\nthe following ways.\\nContent revisions for clarity, accuracy, and currency\\nThe revision plan varied by chapter based on need. Some chapters were significantly updated for conceptual\\ncoverage, research-informed data, and clearer language. In other chapters, the revisions focused mostly on\\ncurrency of examples and updates to statistics.\\nOver 210 new research references have been added or updated in order to improve the scholarly\\nunderpinnings of the material and broaden the perspective for students. Dozens of examples and feature\\nboxes have been changed or added to better explain concepts and/or increase relevance for students.\\nResearch replication and validity\\nTo engage students in stronger critical analysis and inform them about research reproducibility, substantial\\ncoverage has been added to the research chapter and strategically throughout the textbook whenever key\\n2 Preface\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nstudies are discussed. This material is presented in a balanced way and provides instructors with ample\\nopportunity to discuss the importance of replication in a manner that best suits their course.\\nDiversity, representation, and inclusion\\nWith the help of researchers and teachers who focus on diversity- and identity-related issues, OpenStax has\\nengaged in detailed diversity reviews to identify opportunities to improve the textbook. Reviewers were asked\\nto follow a framework to evaluate the book’s terminology, research citations, key contributors to the field,\\nphotos and illustrations, and related aspects, commenting on the representation and consideration of diverse\\ngroups. Significant additions and revisions were made in this regard, and the review framework itself is\\navailable among the OpenStax Psychology 2e instructor resources.\\nArt and illustrations\\nUnder the guidance of the authors and expert scientific illustrators, especially those well versed in creating\\naccessible art, the OpenStax team made changes throughout the art program in Psychology 2e.\\nAccessibility improvements\\nAs with all OpenStax books, the first edition of Psychology was created with a focus on accessibility. We have\\nemphasized and improved that approach in the second edition. Our goal is to ensure that all OpenStax\\nwebsites and the web view versions of our learning materials follow accessible web design best practices, so\\nthat they will meet the W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 at Level AA and Section 508\\nof the Rehabilitation Act. The WCAG 2.0 guidelines explain ways to make web content more accessible for\\npeople with disabilities and more user-friendly for everyone.\\n• To accommodate users of specific assistive technologies, all alternative text was reviewed and revised for\\ncomprehensiveness and clarity.\\n• All illustrations were revised to improve the color contrast, which is important for some visually impaired\\nstudents.\\n• Overall, the OpenStax platform has been continually upgraded to improve accessibility.\\nTo learn more about our commitment and progress, please view our accessibility statement\\n(https://openstax.org/accessibility-statement).\\nA transition guide will be available on openstax.org to highlight the specific chapter-level changes to the\\nsecond edition.\\nPedagogical foundation\\nPsychology 2e engages students through inquiry, self-reflection, and investigation. Features in the second\\nedition have been carefully updated to remain topical and relevant while deepening students’ relationship to\\nthe material. They include the following:\\n• Everyday Connection features tie psychological topics to everyday issues and behaviors that students\\nencounter in their lives and the world. Topics include the validity of scores on college entrance exams, the\\nopioid crisis, the impact of social status on stress and healthcare, and cognitive mapping.\\n• What Do You Think? features provide research-based information and ask students their views on\\ncontroversial issues. Topics include “Brain Dead and on Life Support,” “Violent Media and Aggression,”\\nand “Capital Punishment and Criminals with Intellectual Disabilities.”\\n• Dig Deeper features discuss one specific aspect of a topic in greater depth so students can dig more\\ndeeply into the concept. Examples include discussions on the distinction between evolutionary\\npsychology and behavioral genetics, recent findings on neuroplasticity, the field of forensic psychology,\\nand a presentation of research on strategies for coping with prejudice and discrimination.\\n• Connect the Concepts features revisit a concept learned in another chapter, expanding upon it within a\\ndifferent context. Features include “Emotional Expression and Emotional Regulation,” “Tweens, Teens,\\nPreface 3\\nand Social Norms,” and “Conditioning and OCD.”\\nArt, interactives, and assessments that engage\\nOur art program is designed to enhance students’ understanding of psychological concepts through simple,\\neffective graphs, diagrams, and photographs. Psychology 2e also incorporates links to relevant interactive\\nexercises and animations that help bring topics to life. Selected assessment items touch directly on students’\\nlives.\\n• Link to Learning features direct students to online interactive exercises and animations that add a fuller\\ncontext to core content and provide an opportunity for application.\\n• Personal Application Questions engage students in topics at a personal level to encourage reflection and\\npromote discussion.\\nAdditional Resources\\nStudent and Instructor Resources\\nWe’ve compiled additional resources for both students and instructors, including Getting Started Guides, an\\ninstructor solution guide, a test bank, and PowerPoint slides.

The early work of the humanistic psychologists redirected\\nattention to the individual human as a whole, and as a conscious and self-aware being. By the 1950s, new\\ndisciplinary perspectives in linguistics, neuroscience, and computer science were emerging, and these areas\\nrevived interest in the mind as a focus of scientific inquiry. This particular perspective has come to be known\\nas the cognitive revolution (Miller, 2003). By 1967, Ulric Neisser published the first textbook entitled Cognitive\\nPsychology, which served as a core text in cognitive psychology courses around the country (Thorne & Henley,\\n2005).\\nAlthough no one person is entirely responsible for starting the cognitive revolution, Noam Chomsky was very\\ninfluential in the early days of this movement (Figure 1.9). Chomsky (1928–), an American linguist, was\\ndissatisfied with the influence that behaviorism had had on psychology. He believed that psychology’s focus on\\nbehavior was short-sighted and that the field had to re-incorporate mental functioning into its purview if it\\nwere to offer any meaningful contributions to understanding behavior (Miller, 2003).\\nFIGURE 1.9 Noam Chomsky was very influential in beginning the cognitive revolution. In 2010, this mural honoring\\nhim was put up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (credit: Robert Moran)\\nEuropean psychology had never really been as influenced by behaviorism as had American psychology; and\\nthus, the cognitive revolution helped reestablish lines of communication between European psychologists and\\ntheir American counterparts. Furthermore, psychologists began to cooperate with scientists in other fields,\\nlike anthropology, linguistics, computer science, and neuroscience, among others. This interdisciplinary\\napproach often was referred to as the cognitive sciences, and the influence and prominence of this particular\\nperspective resonates in modern-day psychology (Miller, 2003).\\nFeminist Psychology\\nThe science of psychology has had an impact on human wellbeing, both positive and negative. The dominant\\ninfluence of Western, White, and male academics in the early history of psychology meant that psychology\\ndeveloped with the biases inherent in those individuals, which often had negative consequences for members of\\nsociety who were not White or male. Women, members of ethnic minorities in both the United States and other\\ncountries, and individuals with sexual orientations other than straight had difficulties entering the field of\\npsychology and therefore influencing its development. They also suffered from the attitudes of White male\\npsychologists who were not immune to the nonscientific attitudes prevalent in the society in which they\\nDIG DEEPER\\n16 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\ndeveloped and worked. Until the 1960s, the science of psychology was largely a “womanless” psychology\\n(Crawford & Marecek, 1989), meaning that few women were able to practice psychology, so they had little\\ninfluence on what was studied. In addition, the experimental subjects of psychology were mostly men, which\\nresulted from underlying assumptions that gender had no influence on psychology and that women were not of\\nsufficient interest to study.\\nAn article by Naomi Weisstein, first published in 1968 (Weisstein, 1993), stimulated a feminist revolution in\\npsychology by presenting a critique of psychology as a science. She also specifically criticized male psychologists\\nfor constructing the psychology of women entirely out of their own cultural biases and without careful\\nexperimental tests to verify any of their characterizations of women. Weisstein used, as examples, statements by\\nprominent psychologists in the 1960s, such as this quote by Bruno Bettleheim: “We must start with the\\nrealization that, as much as women want to be good scientists or engineers, they want first and foremost to be\\nwomanly companions of men and to be mothers.” Weisstein’s critique formed the foundation for the subsequent\\ndevelopment of a feminist psychology that attempted to be free of the influence of male cultural biases on our\\nknowledge of the psychology of women.\\nCrawford & Marecek (1989) identify several feminist approaches to psychology that can be described as feminist\\npsychology. These include re-evaluating and discovering the contributions of women to the history of psychology,\\nstudying psychological gender differences, and questioning the male bias present across the practice of the\\nscientific approach to knowledge.\\nMulticultural And Cross-Cultural Psychology\\nCulture impacts individuals, groups, and society. An ongoing issue researchers are trying to correct is that\\ncertain populations have been over-studied and the results of these studies have been applied to other\\npopulations. For example, Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan discuss how WEIRD societies have been\\noverstudied and the results have been wrongly applied to non-WEIRD societies (2010). WEIRD stands for\\nwestern, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic. Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan found that there are\\nmany differences between people in the WEIRD group and people in less industrialized, less urban, and non-\\nWestern societies. These differences occur in a variety of areas, including perception, cooperation, and moral\\nreasoning. That is, people vary depending on their culture and environment. Multicultural psychologists\\ndevelop theories and conduct research with diverse populations, typically within one country. Cross-cultural\\npsychologists compare populations across countries, such as participants from the United States compared to\\nparticipants from China.\\nIn 1920, Francis Cecil Sumner was the first African American to receive a PhD in psychology in the United\\nStates. Sumner established a psychology degree program at Howard University, leading to the education of a\\nnew generation of African American psychologists (Black, Spence, and Omari, 2004). Much of the work of early\\npsychologists from diverse backgrounds was dedicated to challenging intelligence testing and promoting\\ninnovative educational methods for children. George I. Sanchez contested such testing with Mexican American\\nchildren. As a psychologist of Mexican heritage, he pointed out that the language and cultural barriers in\\ntesting were keeping children from equal opportunities (Guthrie, 1998). By 1940, he was teaching with his\\ndoctoral degree at University of Texas at Austin and challenging segregated educational practices (Romo,\\n1986).\\nTwo famous African American researchers and psychologists are Mamie Phipps Clark and her husband,\\nKenneth Clark. They are best known for their studies conducted on African American children and doll\\npreference, research that was instrumental in the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court desegregation\\ncase. The Clarks applied their research to social services and opened the first child guidance center in Harlem\\n(American Psychological Association, 2019).\\nListen to the podcast below describing the Clarks' research and impact on the Supreme Court decision.\\n1.2 • History of Psychology 17\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nListen to a podcast about the influence of an African American's psychology research on the historic Brown v.\\nBoard of Education civil rights case (http://openstax.org/l/crogers2) to learn more.\\nThe American Psychological Association has several ethnically based organizations for professional\\npsychologists that facilitate interactions among members. Since psychologists belonging to specific ethnic\\ngroups or cultures have the most interest in studying the psychology of their communities, these organizations\\nprovide an opportunity for the growth of research on the interplay between culture and psychology.\\nWOMEN IN PSYCHOLOGY\\nAlthough rarely given credit, women have been contributing to psychology since its inception as a field of\\nstudy. In 1894, Margaret Floy Washburn was the first woman awarded the doctoral degree in psychology. She\\nwrote The Animal Mind: A Textbook of Comparative Psychology, and it was the standard in the field for over 20\\nyears. In the mid 1890s, Mary Whiton Calkins completed all requirements toward the PhD in psychology, but\\nHarvard University refused to award her that degree because she was a woman. She had been taught and\\nmentored by William James, who tried and failed to convince Harvard to award her the doctoral degree. Her\\nmemory research studied primacy and recency (Madigan & O’Hara, 1992), and she also wrote about how\\nstructuralism and functionalism both explained self-psychology (Calkins, 1906).\\nAnother influential woman, Mary Cover Jones, conducted a study she considered to be a sequel to John B.\\nWatson’s study of Little Albert (you’ll learn about this study in the chapter on Learning). Jones unconditioned\\nfear in Little Peter, who had been afraid of rabbits (Jones, 1924).\\nEthnic minority women contributing to the field of psychology include Martha Bernal and Inez Beverly Prosser;\\ntheir studies were related to education. Bernal, the first Latina to earn her doctoral degree in psychology\\n(1962) conducted much of her research with Mexican American children. Prosser was the first African\\nAmerican woman awarded the PhD in 1933 at the University of Cincinnati (Benjamin, Henry, & McMahon,\\n2005).\\n1.3 Contemporary Psychology\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Appreciate the diversity of interests and foci within psychology\\n• Understand basic interests and applications in each of the described areas of psychology\\n• Demonstrate familiarity with some of the major concepts or important figures in each of the described areas of\\npsychology\\nContemporary psychology is a diverse field that is influenced by all of the historical perspectives described in\\nthe preceding section. Reflective of the discipline’s diversity is the diversity seen within the American\\nPsychological Association (APA). The APA is a professional organization representing psychologists in the\\nUnited States. The APA is the largest organization of psychologists in the world, and its mission is to advance\\nand disseminate psychological knowledge for the betterment of people. There are 54 divisions within the APA,\\nrepresenting a wide variety of specialties that range from Societies for the Psychology of Religion and\\nSpirituality to Exercise and Sport Psychology to Behavioral Neuroscience and Comparative Psychology.\\nReflecting the diversity of the field of psychology itself, members, affiliate members, and associate members\\nspan the spectrum from students to doctoral-level psychologists, and come from a variety of places including\\neducational settings, criminal justice, hospitals, the armed forces, and industry (American Psychological\\nAssociation, 2014). G. Stanley Hall was the first president of the APA. Before he earned his doctoral degree, he\\nwas an adjunct instructor at Wilberforce University, a historically Black college/university (HBCU), while\\nserving as faculty at Antioch College. Hall went on to work under William James, earning his PhD. Eventually,\\n18 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nhe became the first president of Clark University in Massachusetts when it was founded (Pickren & Rutherford,\\n2010).\\nThe Association for Psychological Science (APS) was founded in 1988 and seeks to advance the scientific\\norientation of psychology. Its founding resulted from disagreements between members of the scientific and\\nclinical branches of psychology within the APA. The APS publishes five research journals and engages in\\neducation and advocacy with funding agencies. A significant proportion of its members are international,\\nalthough the majority is located in the United States. Other organizations provide networking and\\ncollaboration opportunities for professionals of several ethnic or racial groups working in psychology, such as\\nthe National Latina/o Psychological Association (NLPA), the Asian American Psychological Association (AAPA),\\nthe Association of Black Psychologists (ABPsi), and the Society of Indian Psychologists (SIP). Most of these\\ngroups are also dedicated to studying psychological and social issues within their specific communities.\\nThis section will provide an overview of the major subdivisions within psychology today in the order in which\\nthey are introduced throughout the remainder of this textbook. This is not meant to be an exhaustive listing,\\nbut it will provide insight into the major areas of research and practice of modern-day psychologists.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nPlease visit this website about the divisions within the APA (http://openstax.org/l/biopsychology) to learn more.\\nView these student resources (http://openstax.org/l/studentresource) also provided by the APA.\\nBiopsychology and Evolutionary Psychology\\nAs the name suggests, biopsychology explores how our biology influences our behavior. While biological\\npsychology is a broad field, many biological psychologists want to understand how the structure and function\\nof the nervous system is related to behavior (Figure 1.10). As such, they often combine the research strategies\\nof both psychologists and physiologists to accomplish this goal (as discussed in Carlson, 2013).\\nFIGURE 1.10 Biological psychologists study how the structure and function of the nervous system generate\\nbehavior.\\nThe research interests of biological psychologists span a number of domains, including but not limited to,\\n1.3 • Contemporary Psychology 19\\nsensory and motor systems, sleep, drug use and abuse, ingestive behavior, reproductive behavior,\\nneurodevelopment, plasticity of the nervous system, and biological correlates of psychological disorders.\\nGiven the broad areas of interest falling under the purview of biological psychology, it will probably come as no\\nsurprise that individuals from all sorts of backgrounds are involved in this research, including biologists,\\nmedical professionals, physiologists, and chemists. This interdisciplinary approach is often referred to as\\nneuroscience, of which biological psychology is a component (Carlson, 2013).\\nWhile biopsychology typically focuses on the immediate causes of behavior based in the physiology of a\\nhuman or other animal, evolutionary psychology seeks to study the ultimate biological causes of behavior. To\\nthe extent that a behavior is impacted by genetics, a behavior, like any anatomical characteristic of a human or\\nanimal, will demonstrate adaption to its surroundings. These surroundings include the physical environment\\nand, since interactions between organisms can be important to survival and reproduction, the social\\nenvironment. The study of behavior in the context of evolution has its origins with Charles Darwin, the co-\\ndiscoverer of the theory of evolution by natural selection. Darwin was well aware that behaviors should be\\nadaptive and wrote books titled, The Descent of Man (1871) and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and\\nAnimals (1872), to explore this field.\\nEvolutionary psychology, and specifically, the evolutionary psychology of humans, has enjoyed a resurgence in\\nrecent decades. To be subject to evolution by natural selection, a behavior must have a significant genetic\\ncause. In general, we expect all human cultures to express a behavior if it is caused genetically, since the\\ngenetic differences among human groups are small. The approach taken by most evolutionary psychologists is\\nto predict the outcome of a behavior in a particular situation based on evolutionary theory and then to make\\nobservations, or conduct experiments, to determine whether the results match the theory. It is important to\\nrecognize that these types of studies are not strong evidence that a behavior is adaptive, since they lack\\ninformation that the behavior is in some part genetic and not entirely cultural (Endler, 1986). Demonstrating\\nthat a trait, especially in humans, is naturally selected is extraordinarily difficult; perhaps for this reason,\\nsome evolutionary psychologists are content to assume the behaviors they study have genetic determinants\\n(Confer et al., 2010).\\nOne other drawback of evolutionary psychology is that the traits that we possess now evolved under\\nenvironmental and social conditions far back in human history, and we have a poor understanding of what\\nthese conditions were. This makes predictions about what is adaptive for a behavior difficult. Behavioral traits\\nneed not be adaptive under current conditions, only under the conditions of the past when they evolved, about\\nwhich we can only hypothesize.\\nThere are many areas of human behavior for which evolution can make predictions. Examples include\\nmemory, mate choice, relationships between kin, friendship and cooperation, parenting, social organization,\\nand status (Confer et al., 2010).\\nEvolutionary psychologists have had success in finding experimental correspondence between observations\\nand expectations. In one example, in a study of mate preference differences between men and women that\\nspanned 37 cultures, Buss (1989) found that women valued earning potential factors greater than men, and\\nmen valued potential reproductive factors (youth and attractiveness) greater than women in their prospective\\nmates. In general, the predictions were in line with the predictions of evolution, although there were deviations\\nin some cultures.\\nSensation and Perception\\nScientists interested in both physiological aspects of sensory systems as well as in the psychological\\nexperience of sensory information work within the area of sensation and perception (Figure 1.11). As such,\\nsensation and perception research is also quite interdisciplinary. Imagine walking between buildings as you\\nmove from one class to another. You are inundated with sights, sounds, touch sensations, and smells. You also\\nexperience the temperature of the air around you and maintain your balance as you make your way. These are\\n20 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nTheory X and Theory Y Management Styles\\nTheory X Theory Y\\nPeople dislike work and avoid it. People enjoy work and find it natural.\\nPeople avoid responsibility. People are more satisfied when given responsibility.\\nPeople want to be told what to do. People want to take part in setting their own work goals.\\nGoals are achieved through rules and punishments. Goals are achieved through enticements and rewards.\\nTABLE 13.3\\nAnother management style was described by Donald Clifton, who focused his research on how an organization\\ncan best use an individual’s strengths, an approach he called strengths-based management. He and his\\ncolleagues interviewed 8,000 managers and concluded that it is important to focus on a person’s strengths, not\\ntheir weaknesses. A strength is a particular enduring talent possessed by an individual that allows them to\\nprovide consistent, near-perfect performance in tasks involving that talent. Clifton argued that our strengths\\nprovide the greatest opportunity for growth (Buckingham & Clifton, 2001). An example of a strength is public\\nspeaking or the ability to plan a successful event. The strengths-based approach is very popular although its\\neffect on organization performance is not well-studied. However, Kaiser & Overfield (2011) found that\\nmanagers often neglected improving their weaknesses and overused their strengths, both of which interfered\\nwith performance.\\nLeadership is an important element of management. Leadership styles have been of major interest within I-O\\nresearch, and researchers have proposed numerous theories of leadership. Bass (1985) popularized and\\ndeveloped the concepts of transactional leadership versus transformational leadership styles. In transactional\\nleadership, the focus is on supervision and organizational goals, which are achieved through a system of\\nrewards and punishments (i.e., transactions). Transactional leaders maintain the status quo: They are\\nmanagers. This is in contrast to the transformational leader. People who have transformational leadership\\npossess four attributes to varying degrees: They are charismatic (highly liked role models), inspirational\\n(optimistic about goal attainment), intellectually stimulating (encourage critical thinking and problem\\nsolving), and considerate (Bass, Avolio, & Atwater, 1996).\\nAs women increasingly take on leadership roles in corporations, questions have arisen as to whether there are\\ndifferences in leadership styles between men and women (Eagly, Johannesen-Schmidt, & van Engen, 2003).\\nEagly & Johnson (1990) conducted a meta-analysis to examine gender and leadership style. They found, to a\\nslight but significant degree, that women tend to practice an interpersonal style of leadership (i.e., she focuses\\non the morale and welfare of the employees) and men practice a task-oriented style (i.e., he focuses on\\naccomplishing tasks). However, the differences were less pronounced when one looked only at organizational\\nstudies and excluded laboratory experiments or surveys that did not involve actual organizational leaders.\\nLarger gender-related differences were observed when leadership style was categorized as democratic or\\nautocratic, and these differences were consistent across all types of studies. The authors suggest that\\nsimilarities between genders in leadership styles are attributable to different genders needing to conform to\\nthe organization’s culture; additionally, they propose that gender-related differences reflect inherent\\ndifferences in the strengths each gender brings to bear on leadership practice. In another meta-analysis of\\nleadership style, Eagly, Johannesen-Schmidt, & van Engen (2003) found that women tended to exhibit the\\ncharacteristics of transformational leaders, while men were more likely to be transactional leaders. However,\\nthe differences are not absolute; for example, women were found to use methods of reward for performance\\nmore often than men, which is a component of transactional leadership. The differences they found were\\n472 13 • Industrial-Organizational Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nrelatively small. As Eagly, Johannesen-Schmidt, & van Engen (2003) point out, research shows that\\ntransformational leadership approaches are more effective than transactional approaches, although individual\\nleaders typically exhibit elements of both approaches.\\nA new and emerging area of research within psychology focuses on leadership and the relationship with\\nleaders from the perspective of a follower. This “followership” research suggests that studies need to examine\\nthe leader-follower relationship in both directions—instead of focusing only on leadership—to better\\nunderstand the dynamics of the relationship. Put differently, people are individuals, and because they are\\ndifferent, there probably is no single best leadership-follower dynamic between leaders and followers. For\\ninstance, think about the differences between yourself and someone you know well. Do you respond the same\\nway to criticism? Maybe one of you likes a lot of structure and other seems to work best with less structure.\\nPerhaps, one of you is ready to try a new restaurant at any time and the other prefers to go to the tried-and-true\\nplace that you’ve visited so many times the servers know your order before you place it.\\nSome early research has discovered that the characteristics of individual followers will result in different types\\nof relationships with a leader depending on the leadership style. It appears that not all leadership styles work\\nwell with all follower types. One characteristic of followers, for example, is their degree of extroversion.\\nPrevious research suggests that individuals with a high degree of extroversion would need a larger amount of\\ninteraction with their leaders in order to function well; however, other research suggests this may not\\nnecessarily be the case and instead other factors may be at work (Phillips & Bedeian; Bauer et al, 2006).\\nAnother characteristic of followers is their individual need for growth. For followers who have a strong desire\\nto learn and grow within their organization, a leader who provides developmental opportunities might be\\nbetter received than one who does not. In addition, for those followers who are low on growth and need\\nstrength, leaders who push them to grow may make them less satisfied followers as they feel forced into\\nfurther development and training, possibly signaling a lower level of achievement from their supervisor.\\nTraining for leaders in both helping employees who have a strong drive for growth and those who do not\\nappears to be helpful in improving the relationship between both types of followers and their leaders (Schyns,\\nKroon, & Moors, 2008).\\nFinally, an employee’s need for leadership is an important component of the leader-follower relationship.\\nSome individuals are significantly more autonomous than others and as a result do not respond as well to\\nleaders who provide a lot of structure and rigidity of processes, in turn reducing the quality of their\\nrelationship with their leader. Other employees who are high in need for leadership have a better relationship\\nwith their leader if they are provided with a well-structured environment with clear responsibilities and little\\nambiguity in their work. These followers work best in situations where they feel they can comfortably perform\\nthe work with little requirement to think outside of the guidelines that have been provided. For these\\nindividuals, having a leader who is able to set a clear path forward for the employee with little need for\\ndeviation promotes a strong positive leader-follower relationship (Felfe & Schyns, 2006).\\nGoals, Teamwork and Work Teams\\nThe workplace today is rapidly changing due to a variety of factors, such as shifts in technology, economics,\\nforeign competition, globalization, and workplace demographics. Organizations need to respond quickly to\\nchanges in these factors. Many companies are responding to these changes by structuring their organizations\\nso that work can be delegated to work teams, which bring together diverse skills, experience, and expertise.\\nThis is in contrast to organizational structures that have individuals at their base (Naquin & Tynan, 2003). In\\nthe team-based approach, teams are brought together and given a specific task or goal to accomplish. Despite\\ntheir burgeoning popularity, team structures do not always deliver greater productivity—the work of teams is\\nan active area of research (Naquin & Tynan, 2003).\\nWhy do some teams work well while others do not? There are many contributing factors. For example, teams\\ncan mask team members that are not working (i.e., social loafing). Teams can be inefficient due to poor\\n13.3 • Organizational Psychology: The Social Dimension of Work 473\\ncommunication; they can have poor decision-making skills due to conformity effects; and, they can have\\nconflict within the group. The popularity of teams may in part result from the team halo effect: Teams are\\ngiven credit for their successes. but individuals within a team are blamed for team failures (Naquin & Tynan,\\n2003). One aspect of team diversity is their gender mix. Researchers have explored whether gender mix has an\\neffect on team performance. On the one hand, diversity can introduce communication and interpersonal-\\nrelationship problems that hinder performance, but on the other hand diversity can also increase the team’s\\nskill set, which may include skills that can actually improve team member interactions. Hoogendoorn,\\nOosterbeek, & van Praag (2013) studied project teams in a university business school in which the gender mix\\nof the teams was manipulated. They found that gender-balanced teams performed better, as measured by\\nsales and profits, than teams made up mostly by men. The study did not have enough data to determine the\\nrelative performance of teams with more women than men. The study was unsuccessful in identifying which\\nmechanism (interpersonal relationships, learning, or skills mixes) accounted for performance improvement.\\nThere are three basic types of teams: problem resolution teams, creative teams, and tactical teams. Problem\\nresolution teams are created for the purpose of solving a particular problem or issue; for example, the\\ndiagnostic teams at the Centers for Disease Control. Creative teams are used to develop innovative possibilities\\nor solutions; for example, design teams for car manufacturers create new vehicle models. Tactical teams are\\nused to execute a well-defined plan or objective, such as a police or FBI SWAT team handling a hostage\\nsituation (Larson & LaFasto, 1989). One area of active research involves a fourth kind of team—the virtual\\nteam; these studies examine how groups of geographically disparate people brought together using digital\\ncommunications technology function (Powell, Piccoli, & Ives, 2004). Even before the COVID-19 pandemic,\\nvirtual teams were more common due to the growing globalization of organizations and the use of consulting\\nand partnerships facilitated by digital communication.\\nOrganizational Culture\\nEach company and organization has an organizational culture. Organizational culture encompasses the\\nvalues, visions, hierarchies, norms, and interactions among its employees. It is how an organization is run,\\nhow it operates, and how it makes decisions—the industry in which the organization participates may have an\\ninfluence. Different departments within one company can develop their own subculture within the\\norganization’s culture. Ostroff, Kinicki, and Tamkins (2003) identify three layers in organizational culture:\\nobservable artifacts, espoused values, and basic assumptions. Observable artifacts are the symbols, language\\n(jargon, slang, and humor), narratives (stories and legends), and practices (rituals) that represent the\\nunderlying cultural assumptions. Espoused values are concepts or beliefs that the management or the entire\\norganization endorses. They are the rules that allow employees to know which actions they should take in\\ndifferent situations and which information they should adhere to. These basic assumptions generally are\\nunobservable and unquestioned. Researchers have developed survey instruments to measure organizational\\nculture.\\nWith the workforce being a global marketplace, your company may have a supplier in Korea and another in\\nHonduras and have employees in the United States, China, and South Africa. You may have coworkers of\\ndifferent religious, ethnic, or racial backgrounds than yourself. Your coworkers may be from different places\\naround the globe. Many workplaces offer diversity training to help everyone involved bridge and understand\\ncultural differences. Diversity training educates participants about cultural differences with the goal of\\nimproving teamwork. There is always the potential for prejudice between members of two groups, but the\\nevidence suggests that simply working together, particularly if the conditions of work are set carefully that\\nsuch prejudice can be reduced or eliminated. Pettigrew and Tropp (2006) conducted a meta-analysis to\\nexamine the question of whether contact between groups reduced prejudice between those groups. They found\\nthat there was a moderate but significant effect. They also found that, as previously theorized, the effect was\\nenhanced when the two groups met under conditions in which they have equal standing, common goals,\\ncooperation between the groups, and especially support on the part of the institution or authorities for the\\ncontact.\\n474 13 • Industrial-Organizational Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nManaging Generational Differences\\nAn important consideration in managing employees is age. Workers’ expectations and attitudes are developed in\\npart by experience in particular cultural time periods. Generational constructs are somewhat arbitrary, yet they\\nmay be helpful in setting broad directions to organizational management as one generation leaves the workforce\\nand another enters it. The baby boomer generation (born between 1946 and 1964) is in the process of leaving\\nthe workforce and will continue to depart it for a decade or more. Generation X (born between the early 1960s\\nand the 1980s) are now in the middle of their careers. Millennials (born from 1979 to the early 1994) began to\\ncome of age at the turn of the century, and are early in their careers.\\nToday, as these three different generations work side by side in the workplace, employers and managers need to\\nbe able to identify their unique characteristics. Each generation has distinctive expectations, habits, attitudes,\\nand motivations (Elmore, 2010). One of the major differences among these generations is knowledge of the use\\nof technology in the workplace. Millennials are technologically sophisticated and believe their use of technology\\nsets them apart from other generations. They have also been characterized as self-centered and overly self-\\nconfident. Their attitudinal differences have raised concerns for managers about maintaining their motivation as\\nemployees and their ability to integrate into organizational culture created by baby boomers (Myers &\\nSadaghiani, 2010). For example, millennials may expect to hear that they need to pay their dues in their jobs\\nfrom baby boomers who believe they paid their dues in their time. Yet millennials may resist doing so because\\nthey value life outside of work to a greater degree (Myers & Sadaghiani, 2010). Meister & Willyerd (2010) suggest\\nalternative approaches to training and mentoring that will engage millennials and adapt to their need for\\nfeedback from supervisors: reverse mentoring, in which a younger employee educates a senior employee in\\nsocial media or other digital resources. The senior employee then has the opportunity to provide useful guidance\\nwithin a less demanding role.\\nRecruiting and retaining millennials and Generation X employees poses challenges that did not exist in previous\\ngenerations. The concept of building a career with the company is not relatable to most Generation X employees,\\nwho do not expect to stay with one employer for their career. This expectation arises from of a reduced sense of\\nloyalty because they do not expect their employer to be loyal to them (Gibson, Greenwood, & Murphy, 2009).\\nRetaining Generation X workers thus relies on motivating them by making their work meaningful (Gibson,\\nGreenwood, & Murphy, 2009). Since millennials lack an inherent loyalty to the company, retaining them also\\nrequires effort in the form of nurturing through frequent rewards, praise, and feedback.\\nMillennials are also interested in having many choices, including options in work scheduling, choice of job duties,\\nand so on. They also expect more training and education from their employers. Companies that offer the best\\nbenefit package and brand attract millennials (Myers & Sadaghiani, 2010).\\nOne well-recognized negative aspect of organizational culture is a culture of harassment, including sexual\\nharassment. Most organizations of any size have developed sexual harassment policies that define sexual\\nharassment (or harassment in general) and the procedures the organization has set in place to prevent and\\naddress it when it does occur. Thus, in most jobs you have held, you were probably made aware of the\\ncompany’s sexual harassment policy and procedures, and may have received training related to the policy. The\\nU.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (n.d.) provides the following description of sexual\\nharassment:\\nUnwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a\\nsexual nature constitute sexual harassment when this conduct explicitly or implicitly affects an\\nindividual's employment, unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance, or creates\\nan intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment. (par. 2)\\nDIG DEEPER\\n13.3 • Organizational Psychology: The Social Dimension of Work 475\\nOne form of sexual harassment is called quid pro quo. Quid pro quo means you give something to get\\nsomething, and it refers to a situation in which organizational rewards are offered in exchange for sexual\\nfavors. Quid pro quo harassment is often between an employee and a person with greater power in the\\norganization. For example, a supervisor might request an action, such as a kiss or a touch, in exchange for a\\npromotion, a positive performance review, or a pay raise. Another form of sexual harassment is the threat of\\nwithholding a reward if a sexual request is refused. Hostile environment sexual harassment is another type of\\nworkplace harassment. In this situation, an employee experiences conditions in the workplace that are\\nconsidered hostile or intimidating. For example, a work environment that allows offensive language or jokes or\\ndisplays sexually explicit images. Isolated occurrences of these events do not constitute harassment, but a\\npattern of repeated occurrences does. In addition to violating organizational policies against sexual\\nharassment, these forms of harassment are illegal.\\nHarassment does not have to be sexual; it may be related to any of the protected classes in the statutes\\nregulated by the EEOC: race, national origin, religion, or age.\\nViolence in the Workplace\\nWorkplace violence is any act or threat of physical violence, harassment, intimidation, or other threatening,\\ndisruptive behavior that occurs at the workplace. It ranges from threats and verbal abuse to physical assaults\\nand even homicide (Occupational Safety & Health Administration, 2014).\\nThere are different targets of workplace violence: a person could commit violence against coworkers,\\nsupervisors, or property. Warning signs often precede such actions: intimidating behavior, threats, sabotaging\\nequipment, or radical changes in a coworker’s behavior. Often there is intimidation and then escalation that\\nleads to even further escalation. It is important for employees to involve their immediate supervisor if they\\never feel intimidated or unsafe.\\nMurder is the second leading cause of death in the workplace. It is also the primary cause of death for women\\nin the workplace. Every year there are nearly two million workers who are physically assaulted or threatened\\nwith assault. Many are murdered in domestic violence situations by boyfriends or husbands who chose the\\nwoman’s workplace to commit their crimes.\\nThere are many triggers for workplace violence. A significant trigger is the feeling of being treated unfairly,\\nunjustly, or disrespectfully. In a research experiment, Greenberg (1993) examined the reactions of students\\nwho were given pay for a task. In one group, the students were given extensive explanations for the pay rate. In\\nthe second group, the students were given a curt uninformative explanation. The students were made to\\nbelieve the supervisor would not know how much money the student withdrew for payment. The rate of\\nstealing (taking more pay than they were told they deserved) was higher in the group who had been given the\\nlimited explanation. This is a demonstration of the importance of procedural justice in organizations.\\nProcedural justice refers to the fairness of the processes by which outcomes are determined in conflicts with\\nor among employees.\\nIn another study by Greenberg & Barling (1999), they found a history of aggression and amount of alcohol\\nconsumed to be accurate predictors of workplace violence against a coworker. Aggression against a supervisor\\nwas predicted if a worker felt unfairly treated or untrusted. Job security and alcohol consumption predicted\\naggression against a subordinate. To understand and predict workplace violence, Greenberg & Barling (1999)\\nemphasize the importance of considering the employee target of aggression or violence and characteristics of\\nboth the workplace characteristics and the aggressive or violent person.\\n476 13 • Industrial-Organizational Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\n\", 'answer': 'Answer VERY concisely from the provided context only.

While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember\\nwhat he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is\\nassociated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend’s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John\\nNash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would\\ntell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended\\nfor him. He also began to hear voices and became suspicious of the people around him. Soon thereafter, Nash\\nwas diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a state-run mental institution (O’Connor & Robertson,\\n1Introduction to Psychology\\n2002). Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these\\nexperiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain’s internal\\nprocesses and people’s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of\\npsychology has explored these questions.\\n1.1 What Is Psychology?\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Define psychology\\n• Understand the merits of an education in psychology\\nWhat is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology\\nexplores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists\\nuse the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question\\nabout how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the\\nphenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or\\ngroup of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over\\ntime. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes\\nobservations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then\\npublished or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.\\nScientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because\\nit is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We\\nmust ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However,\\nwe can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus,\\npsychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.\\nIn general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot\\narrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the\\nmind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific\\nmethod is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on\\nobservation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or\\nprevious authorities.\\nIt was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this\\ntime, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is,\\nat its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological\\norganism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore,\\npsychology is also a social science.\\nWHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?\\nOften, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to\\nlearn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course\\nbecause it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as\\nnursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare\\npsychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses\\nacross the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology\\nmajors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook’s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality\\nand political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About\\n6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S.\\nDepartment of Education, 2016).\\n8 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nAn education in psychology is valuable for a number of reasons. Psychology students hone critical thinking\\nskills and are trained in the use of the scientific method. Critical thinking is the active application of a set of\\nskills to information for the understanding and evaluation of that information. The evaluation of\\ninformation—assessing its reliability and usefulness— is an important skill in a world full of competing “facts,”\\nmany of which are designed to be misleading. For example, critical thinking involves maintaining an attitude\\nof skepticism, recognizing internal biases, making use of logical thinking, asking appropriate questions, and\\nmaking observations. Psychology students also can develop better communication skills during the course of\\ntheir undergraduate coursework (American Psychological Association, 2011). Together, these factors increase\\nstudents’ scientific literacy and prepare students to critically evaluate the various sources of information they\\nencounter.\\nIn addition to these broad-based skills, psychology students come to understand the complex factors that\\nshape one’s behavior. They appreciate the interaction of our biology, our environment, and our experiences in\\ndetermining who we are and how we will behave. They learn about basic principles that guide how we think\\nand behave, and they come to recognize the tremendous diversity that exists across individuals and across\\ncultural boundaries (American Psychological Association, 2011).\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nWatch a brief video about some questions to consider before deciding to major in psychology\\n(http://openstax.org/l/psycmajor) to learn more.\\n1.2 History of Psychology\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Understand the importance of Wundt and James in the development of psychology\\n• Appreciate Freud’s influence on psychology\\n• Understand the basic tenets of Gestalt psychology\\n• Appreciate the important role that behaviorism played in psychology’s history\\n• Understand basic tenets of humanism\\n• Understand how the cognitive revolution shifted psychology’s focus back to the mind\\nPsychology is a relatively young science with its experimental roots in the 19th century, compared, for\\nexample, to human physiology, which dates much earlier. As mentioned, anyone interested in exploring issues\\nrelated to the mind generally did so in a philosophical context prior to the 19th century. Two 19th century\\nscholars, Wilhelm Wundt and William James, are generally credited as being the founders of psychology as a\\nscience and academic discipline that was distinct from philosophy. This section will provide an overview of the\\nshifts in paradigms that have influenced psychology from Wundt and James through today.\\nWundt and Structuralism\\nWilhelm Wundt (1832–1920) was a German scientist who was the first person to be referred to as a\\npsychologist. His famous book entitled Principles of Physiological Psychology was published in 1873. Wundt\\nviewed psychology as a scientific study of conscious experience, and he believed that the goal of psychology\\nwas to identify components of consciousness and how those components combined to result in our conscious\\nexperience. Wundt used introspection (he called it “internal perception”), a process by which someone\\nexamines their own conscious experience as objectively as possible, making the human mind like any other\\naspect of nature that a scientist observed. He believed in the notion of voluntarism—that people have free will\\nand should know the intentions of a psychological experiment if they were participating (Danziger, 1980).\\nWundt considered his version experimental introspection; he used instruments such as those that measured\\nreaction time. He also wrote Volkerpsychologie in 1904 in which he suggested that psychology should include\\nthe study of culture, as it involves the study of people. Edward Titchener, one of his students, went on to\\n1.2 • History of Psychology 9\\ndevelop structuralism. Its focus was on the contents of mental processes rather than their function (Pickren &\\nRutherford, 2010). Wundt established his psychology laboratory at the University at Leipzig in 1879 (Figure\\n1.2). In this laboratory, Wundt and his students conducted experiments on, for example, reaction times. A\\nsubject, sometimes in a room isolated from the scientist, would receive a stimulus such as a light, image, or\\nsound. The subject’s reaction to the stimulus would be to push a button, and an apparatus would record the\\ntime to reaction. Wundt could measure reaction time to one-thousandth of a second (Nicolas & Ferrand, 1999).\\nFIGURE 1.2 (a) Wilhelm Wundt is credited as one of the founders of psychology. He created the first laboratory for\\npsychological research. (b) This photo shows him seated and surrounded by fellow researchers and equipment in\\nhis laboratory in Germany.\\nHowever, despite his efforts to train individuals in the process of introspection, this process remained highly\\nsubjective, and there was very little agreement between individuals.\\nFunctionalism\\nWilliam James, John Dewey, and Charles Sanders Peirce helped establish functional psychology (Figure 1.3).\\nThey accepted Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection and viewed this theory as an explanation of an\\norganism’s characteristics. Key to that theory is the idea that natural selection leads to organisms that are\\nadapted to their environment, including their behavior. Adaptation means that a trait of an organism has a\\nfunction for the survival and reproduction of the individual, because it has been naturally selected. As James\\nsaw it, psychology’s purpose was to study the function of behavior in the world, and as such, his perspective\\nwas known as functionalism. Functionalism focused on how mental activities helped an organism fit into its\\nenvironment. Functionalism has a second, more subtle meaning in that functionalists were more interested in\\nthe operation of the whole mind rather than of its individual parts, which were the focus of structuralism. Like\\nWundt, James believed that introspection could serve as one means by which someone might study mental\\nactivities, but James also relied on more objective measures, including the use of various recording devices,\\nand examinations of concrete products of mental activities and of anatomy and physiology (Gordon, 1995).\\n10 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nFIGURE 1.3 William James, shown here in a self-portrait, was the first American psychologist.\\nFreud and Psychoanalytic Theory\\nPerhaps one of the most influential and well-known figures in psychology’s history was Sigmund Freud (Figure\\n1.4). Freud (1856–1939) was an Austrian neurologist who was fascinated by patients suffering from “hysteria”\\nand neurosis. Hysteria was an ancient diagnosis for disorders, primarily of women with a wide variety of\\nsymptoms, including physical symptoms and emotional disturbances, none of which had an apparent physical\\ncause. Freud theorized that many of his patients’ problems arose from the unconscious mind. In Freud’s view,\\nthe unconscious mind was a repository of feelings and urges of which we have no awareness. Gaining access to\\nthe unconscious, then, was crucial to the successful resolution of the patient’s problems. According to Freud,\\nthe unconscious mind could be accessed through dream analysis, by examinations of the first words that came\\nto people’s minds, and through seemingly innocent slips of the tongue. Psychoanalytic theory focuses on the\\nrole of a person’s unconscious, as well as early childhood experiences, and this particular perspective\\ndominated clinical psychology for several decades (Thorne & Henley, 2005).\\nFIGURE 1.4 (a) Sigmund Freud was a highly influential figure in the history of psychology. (b) One of his many\\nbooks, A General Introduction to Psychoanalysis, shared his ideas about psychoanalytical therapy; it was published\\nin 1922.\\nFreud’s ideas were influential, and you will learn more about them when you study lifespan development,\\npersonality, and therapy.

(credit: modification of work by\\n“antisocialtory”/Flickr)\\nINTRODUCTION\\nCHAPTER OUTLINE\\n2.1 Why Is Research Important?\\n2.2 Approaches to Research\\n2.3 Analyzing Findings\\n2.4 Ethics\\nHave you ever wondered whether the violence you see on television affects your behavior?\\nAre you more likely to behave aggressively in real life after watching people behave violently in dramatic\\nsituations on the screen? Or, could seeing fictional violence actually get aggression out of your system, causing\\nyou to be more peaceful? How are children influenced by the media they are exposed to? A psychologist\\ninterested in the relationship between behavior and exposure to violent images might ask these very\\nquestions.\\nSince ancient times, humans have been concerned about the effects of new technologies on our behaviors and\\nthinking processes. The Greek philosopher Socrates, for example, worried that writing—a new technology at\\nthat time—would diminish people’s ability to remember because they could rely on written records rather than\\ncommitting information to memory. In our world of rapidly changing technologies, questions about their\\neffects on our daily lives and their resulting long-term impacts continue to emerge. In addition to the impact of\\nscreen time (on smartphones, tablets, computers, and gaming), technology is emerging in our vehicles (such\\nas GPS and smart cars) and residences (with devices like Alexa or Google Home and doorbell cameras). As\\nthese technologies become integrated into our lives, we are faced with questions about their positive and\\nnegative impacts. Many of us find ourselves with a strong opinion on these issues, only to find the person next\\nto us bristling with the opposite view.\\n2Psychological Research\\nHow can we go about finding answers that are supported not by mere opinion, but by evidence that we can all\\nagree on? The findings of psychological research can help us navigate issues like this.\\n2.1 Why Is Research Important?\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Explain how scientific research addresses questions about behavior\\n• Discuss how scientific research guides public policy\\n• Appreciate how scientific research can be important in making personal decisions\\nScientific research is a critical tool for successfully navigating our complex world. Without it, we would be\\nforced to rely solely on intuition, other people’s authority, and blind luck. While many of us feel confident in\\nour abilities to decipher and interact with the world around us, history is filled with examples of how very\\nwrong we can be when we fail to recognize the need for evidence in supporting claims. At various times in\\nhistory, we would have been certain that the sun revolved around a flat earth, that the earth’s continents did\\nnot move, and that mental illness was caused by possession (Figure 2.2). It is through systematic scientific\\nresearch that we divest ourselves of our preconceived notions and superstitions and gain an objective\\nunderstanding of ourselves and our world.\\nFIGURE 2.2 Some of our ancestors, across the world and over the centuries, believed that trephination—the\\npractice of making a hole in the skull, as shown here—allowed evil spirits to leave the body, thus curing mental\\nillness and other disorders. (credit: “taiproject”/Flickr)\\nThe goal of all scientists is to better understand the world around them. Psychologists focus their attention on\\nunderstanding behavior, as well as the cognitive (mental) and physiological (body) processes that underlie\\nbehavior. In contrast to other methods that people use to understand the behavior of others, such as intuition\\nand personal experience, the hallmark of scientific research is that there is evidence to support a claim.\\nScientific knowledge is empirical: It is grounded in objective, tangible evidence that can be observed time and\\ntime again, regardless of who is observing.\\nWhile behavior is observable, the mind is not. If someone is crying, we can see behavior. However, the reason\\nfor the behavior is more difficult to determine. Is the person crying due to being sad, in pain, or happy?\\nSometimes we can learn the reason for someone’s behavior by simply asking a question, like “Why are you\\ncrying?” However, there are situations in which an individual is either uncomfortable or unwilling to answer\\nthe question honestly, or is incapable of answering. For example, infants would not be able to explain why they\\nare crying. In such circumstances, the psychologist must be creative in finding ways to better understand\\nbehavior. This chapter explores how scientific knowledge is generated, and how important that knowledge is in\\nforming decisions in our personal lives and in the public domain.\\n36 2 • Psychological Research\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\n', 'answer': \"Answer VERY concisely from the provided context only.
